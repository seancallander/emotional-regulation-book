<section type="introduction" id="calibre_link-493">
<h2 class="eb04mainhead" id="calibre_link-494"><a id="calibre_link-495" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-496">Hi, my name is Vanessa, and I’m a recovering awkward person.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-497">At school dances, I’d volunteer to watch the punch bowl. Growing up, if a cool kid accidentally bumped into me, I would start hiccupping uncontrollably. When my family got AOL, my first IM buddy was the school nurse. In second grade I tried to get a permanent dismissal from PE by saying I had menopause pains. If only Google had been around in those days.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-498">To prove it, as painful as it is, I present Exhibit A, a photo of me circa 1993:</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-499">As you can see, I went for “helmet hair” without actually playing a sport requiring a helmet&mdash;or any sport, frankly&mdash;while clinging to the belief that nothing complements a baggy T-shirt quite like a sharp vest. A plaid one, though truthfully I wasn’t too picky in the vest department.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-500">On particularly socially anxious days, I would break out in hives right before walking into school and wear long sleeves and pants to cover my swollen, red, itchy limbs. As you might have guessed, the rashes covering my face and scalp didn’t help my popularity rankings.</p>
<div class="portrait_xsmall" id="calibre_link-501"><img src="images/000003.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-358" class="calibre1" /></div>
<div class="caption" id="calibre_link-502">Me, circa 1993</div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-503">It wasn’t all bad, though. On Valentine’s Day, my teachers gave me cards.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-504"><a id="calibre_link-505" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>HUMAN BEHAVIOR HACKING</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-506">It’s an understatement to say that people skills did not come naturally to me. I had to learn them the hard way, so I could teach them to you the easy way. Here’s how it happened: Early on, I figured out that I could learn human behavior just like I studied for math or foreign language tests. I made facial expression flash cards, looked for small-talk patterns, and tried to spot the hidden emotions of my teachers&mdash;although that last one sometimes got me into trouble!</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-507">I read everything I could get my hands on about people&mdash;psychology textbooks, sociological studies, and every human behavior book ever written. Eventually, I began to create my own tests and experiments. For one mini-experiment, I created flash cards of conversation starters based on studies of dopamine, carried them in my purse, tried them on strangers, and then catalogued their reactions. For another, I tried to adopt the alpha body language moves of chimps to see if people would mirror me (that one did NOT work). In yet another, I used persuasion techniques in a business pitch competition to see if I could game the system.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-508">On a whim, I decided to document all of my misadventures and takeaways as a human guinea pig on a blog, <a href="http://ScienceofPeople.com" class="pcalibre calibre5">ScienceofPeople.com</a>. To my surprise and delight, I found I wasn’t the only person struggling to get along with people. As our articles started to pop up all over the web and our videos began going viral, we caught the attention of media outlets like NPR, <em class="calibre6">Inc.</em>, and <em class="calibre6">Forbes</em>, which covered our unique approach. This is when I decided to do larger research experiments and turn Science of People into a human behavior lab.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-509">In our lab, we start every endeavor by finding the latest scientific studies and then turn them into real-life experiments and tactics. We then share these strategies with our readers and students to test them. In this way, each skill in this book has already been refined by thousands of students who have used them in real-life situations and reported their results back to us to perfect.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-510">This method is our secret sauce:</p>
<ul class="none" id="calibre_link-511">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-512"><span class="strong">Step One:</span> Find fascinating research.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-513"><span class="strong">Step Two:</span> Create actionable real-life strategies.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-514"><span class="strong"><a id="calibre_link-515" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Step Three:</span> Test, tweak, and perfect.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-516"><span class="strong">Repeat.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-517">I call our approach behavior hacking. Over the last eight years, I have developed shortcuts, formulas, and blueprints for getting along with anyone. Our unique approach has reached millions of students through our online courses and in-person workshops. I’ve helped corporate teams at Fortune 500 companies increase their interpersonal intelligence, singles make connections at speed-dating workshops, and entrepreneurs win pitch competitions using science-based behavior hacks. My columns and appearances in the <em class="calibre6">Huffington Post</em>, in <em class="calibre6">Forbes</em>, and on CNN are seen all over the world by people who want to improve their relationships.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-518">We have streamlined all of our best findings into a universal framework that makes up this book. Each chapter of <em class="calibre6">Captivate</em> will teach you one of the fourteen behavior hacks. These are simple, powerful tools that you can use to level up your career, improve your relationships, and increase your income.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-519">WHAT YOU WILL LEARN</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-520"><span class="strong">This book will teach you how people work.</span> If you know exactly what makes people tick, you can optimize your behavior, interactions, and relationships. Trying to get along with people without a framework is a bit like solving complex math problems without any equations. It’s both difficult and involves a heck of a lot of unnecessary suffering along the way. This book will give you the people skills you never learned in school.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-521">As diverse as we all seem on the outside, our inner workings are quite similar&mdash;if not eerily predictable. <span class="strong">There are hidden rules to human behavior.</span> We just have to find where to look.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-522">Part I is all about helping you master the <span class="strong">first five minutes</span> of any interaction&mdash;starting a conversation and creating instant likability. First impressions are fundamental to everything else I can teach you.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-523">In <a href="#calibre_link-10" class="pcalibre calibre5">Part II</a>, I will teach you skills that will help you get to know someone better in the <span class="strong">first five hours</span> of any interaction. My system for speed-reading people and decoding behavior will help you whether you are on the first five dates or in the first five meetings. I call this system the matrix&mdash;it doesn’t involve Keanu Reeves, but it’s just as cool. This is what <a id="calibre_link-524" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>happens when you want to level up a casual connection to something deeper.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-525">Part III is about the <span class="strong">first five days</span>. In order to get to know someone on a deeper level, you have to learn how to influence people, lead teams, and increase your impact with everyone you meet. This is the ultimate level of connection and the final and most advanced step for interacting with people.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-526">You can also keep your eyes peeled for Fast Facts, where we pulled in data from our Twitter polls and online surveys that are relevant to the content. They look like this:</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-532">Here’s my promise: Learning people skills will change your life. Developing your PQ&mdash;or interpersonal intelligence&mdash;is like adding a catalyst to your success. By the end of the book you will be able to engage anyone you meet in memorable conversation. You will know how to leave a lasting first impression with clients, colleagues, and friends. And you will have more confidence, control, and charisma in all of your interactions.</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-533" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-534"><span class="strong">People with high PQ make on average $29,000 more per year than people with average PQ.</span></li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-535">90 percent of top business performers have high PQ.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-536"><a id="calibre_link-537" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Individuals with strong interpersonal communication report being 42 percent happier and more fulfilled with their lives.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-538">I joke that people skills are the social lubricant of life. When you understand the laws of human behavior, everything goes more smoothly:</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-539"><span class="strong">Professionally</span>, you will know how to negotiate a raise, connect with colleagues, build rapport at networking events, and nail your elevator pitch.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-540"><span class="strong">Socially</span>, you will make unforgettable first impressions, reduce relationship drama, enjoy stronger and more supportive friendships, and get along with everyone you meet.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-541"><span class="strong">Romantically</span>, you will impress your dates, deepen your relationships, flirt authentically, and prevent partner miscommunications.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-542">Bottom line: There is a science to winning friends and influencing people, and learning it will completely change the way you interact.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-543">Let the adventure begin!</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-203">YOUR PQ SCORE</h5>

</blockquote>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-547">I have developed the following quiz to test your people skills, or your PQ. This quiz will help you assess your current level of interpersonal intelligence. The good news is our PQ can be improved, stretched, and hacked. No matter where you are now, each hack you learn in this book will help get your PQ up.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-548">We will take this test again at the end of the book, and my goal is to help you level up your score by at least fifty points.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-741">Once upon a time, a boy named Harry was teased for wearing thick glasses and having a bookish streak. When the time came to apply to college, he took jobs as a timekeeper in a railroad construction company and as a shelf duster in a pharmacy to support his family. No one would have guessed that this shy boy would one day become the thirty-third president of the United States.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-742">The story of Harry S. Truman is surprising because he doesn’t fit the stereotypical booming presidential personality. On July 19, 1944, this posed a problem. Truman was facing the biggest opportunity of his career. He was vying for the vice presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention. The odds were not in his favor. Then-president Franklin D. Roosevelt had already publicly supported his contender, Henry Wallace, a gifted public speaker <em class="calibre6">and</em> the current vice president.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-743">Truman was not a gifted public speaker&mdash;and he knew it. His team had to draw the battle off the main stage to make the convention work to Truman’s strength: one-on-one rapport building. All day, they pulled delegates into a private, air-conditioned room underneath the platform, called Room H. The convention hall was stiflingly hot, so delegates literally breathed a breath of fresh air as they listened to Truman’s pitch and began to cool off. Then he spent hours standing at the end of the hallway, shaking hands with passing members. Instead of waiting for the results in his hotel room (which is what Henry Wallace and most of the candidates tended to do), Truman ordered a hot dog and sat with his wife in the audience.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-744">In the first ballot, Wallace had 429.5 votes and Truman received 319.5 <a id="calibre_link-745" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>votes. A second ballot was called immediately. Truman had to win friends and he had to win them fast. Instead of making a grand speech, Truman and his team kicked into full gear, working party leaders, delegates, and influential members of the crowd one by one. He worked a solid connection with the right person and then let them convince their people <em class="calibre6">for</em> him.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-746">At 8:14 p.m. the results were announced. Truman led with 1,031 votes to Wallace’s 105. He gained 712 votes in a matter of hours. A few minutes later, Truman gave one of the shortest acceptance speeches in history. He stood patiently at the bank of microphones, and when the audience had finally quieted down he said, “Now, give me a chance.”<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-208" href="#calibre_link-35" class="calibre4 pcalibre">1</a></sup><a id="calibre_link-407" class="footnote_link pcalibre" type="noteref" href="#calibre_link-36">fn1</a></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-747">Truman understood his strengths and played to them. He optimized his interactions for success, and so can you.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-748">THE SCIENCE OF FAKE</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-749">Imagine it’s your dream to play professional basketball. You’re fast and have great ball-handling skills. You also happen to be six feet two inches tall. You have two choices: You could play center, but the average height of an NBA center is six feet eleven inches.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-209" href="#calibre_link-37" class="calibre4 pcalibre">2</a></sup> If you went for center, you would have to fake your height by wearing lifts during games and spending a ton of extra hours after practice working on your vertical jump. Or you could play point guard, where the average height is six feet two inches.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-210" href="#calibre_link-38" class="calibre4 pcalibre">3</a></sup> You wouldn’t have to make up for extra inches with your jump&mdash;you could just focus on playing.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-750">Feigning extroversion is like trying to play center with lifts on. Trying to socially fake it until you make it burns a whole lot of extra energy and doesn’t really work. It also comes across as inauthentic.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-751">In a Science of People survey, we asked 1,036 of our readers the following question:<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-211" href="#calibre_link-39" class="calibre4 pcalibre">4</a></sup></p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-762">Dr. Barbara Wild and her associates found that our emotions are infectious. First, her team showed people pictures of happy or sad faces. Then they gave them a series of mood tests. They found they could “infect” participants with the emotions in each image. Very simply, after viewing a happy face, participants felt more positive. After viewing a sad face, participants felt more negative.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-212" href="#calibre_link-40" class="calibre4 pcalibre">5</a></sup> Here’s what’s crazy: They only flashed each image for 500 milliseconds! Only 500 milliseconds is barely enough time for participants to even register they had seen a face, and they still caught the emotion.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-763">Dr. Wild even found that our smile muscles unconsciously tend to mimic the smiles around us. We are happier around happy individuals, and we thrive with thriving people.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-213" href="#calibre_link-41" class="calibre4 pcalibre">6</a></sup> When you force yourself to go to events you are dreading, you are not only miserable, <span class="strong">but your misery is contagious</span>.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-764">Think you can just fake it until you make it? Think again! We can spot a fake smile a mile away. Over 4,361 people have taken our virtual Body Language Quiz to test their nonverbal intelligence. In one question we show participants a genuine smile hidden among three fake smiles. Over 86.9 percent of participants are correctly able to pick out the genuine smile.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-765">Researchers at the University of Finland showed one group images of fake smiles and another group images of real smiles.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-214" href="#calibre_link-42" class="calibre4 pcalibre">7</a></sup> Like this:</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-768">Can you guess which smile is real and which is the fake? Image A shows a fake smile, and Image B shows a genuine smile.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-769">When participants looked at the real smiles, they felt a positive mood change. But when participants looked at the fake smiles, their mood remained the same. (For more on how you can tell the difference, turn to <a href="#calibre_link-11" class="pcalibre calibre5">Chapter 6</a>.)</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-770">Faking it until you make it is not worth the effort. Happy people make us happy,<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-215" href="#calibre_link-43" class="calibre4 pcalibre">8</a></sup> but fake happy people&mdash;they are forgettable. The first step in winning the social game is to control the situations you play in. Only interact in places where you don’t have to fake it. <span class="strong">No matter how many behavior hacks you learn, if you go to events that make you unhappy, it will be incredibly difficult to increase your memorability.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-771">When you feel great, other people pick up on it and want in on it. When you drag yourself to an event because you feel like you “should make an appearance,” you are the party pooper. And you smell up the event.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-772">This is why you need to have a Social Game Plan.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-778">Here’s the worst piece of advice I was ever given: Say yes to everything. Say yes to networking events, coffees with strangers, and random conferences, because you never know what opportunity might come your way. As the science shows, this is a big smelly sack of baloney.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-779">Unfortunately, it took me years to figure this out. When I first started my blog, I was trying to find any paid writing gig I possibly could. So almost every weeknight, I trudged out to the professional circuit. I prepared for these networking events like I was going into battle, loading up on fat stacks of business cards, fistfuls of no-nonsense pens, and multiple personalized name tags. My uniform consisted of sensible shoes, casual professional attire, perfume, and a news anchor smile.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-780">I fought. For attention, for business, for a break from the interminable boredom of having the same conversation over and over again. After three years of this nonsense (and at least ten pounds from eating so many platters of pigs in a blanket), I threw in the towel. I wasn’t making any real connections, I wasn’t drumming up business, and I certainly wasn’t having a good time.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-781">Why? I wasn’t working to my strengths. Like Truman, I do much better in one-on-one situations. I get overwhelmed by loud rooms with lots of people. Trying to cover up my anxiety with fake smiles just made me come across as inauthentic&mdash;and that’s the problem.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-782">What I needed was a game plan.</p>

<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-788">Skill #1: Play Your Position</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-789">Most people skills books try to force you into one approach&mdash;the bubbly extrovert. They want you to fake it until you make it. They expect you to be “on” all the time with everyone you meet. This is impossible.</p>

Athletes aren’t expected to play every position on a team, so you shouldn’t try to engage in every social role. Play to your position.

<p class="eb29bodytextindentlinespace" id="calibre_link-850">Can you guess which answer was the most popular?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-851">Trick question! There weren’t any clear winners. We couldn’t find a statistically significant pattern because the answers were evenly split. Everyone thrives in different scenarios. This is why it’s hard trying to learn how to “work a party” if you don’t actually like parties. It’s silly trying to learn how to “charm people at a conference” if conferences make your skin crawl. That’s like saying a quarterback should also be able to play as a kicker and linebacker. Maybe he could, but it wouldn’t make for a very successful game.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-852">Let’s identify the positions where you thrive and the ones where you merely survive:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-853" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-854"><span class="strong">Thrive:</span> Look at the first set of places you checked off in the exercise above. Put the top three to five under “My THRIVE Locations” below. These are the places you look forward to going to and where you are your best self.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-855"><span class="strong">Neutral:</span> Certain social situations could go either way depending on your mood or who’s there. They aren’t your favorite, but you don’t dread them. Look at the places that you didn’t check off in either exercise and add the ones that you encounter the most under “My NEUTRAL Locations” below.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-856"><span class="strong">Survive:</span> Other places or scenarios always make you feel uncomfortable, bored, or unhappy. Take three to five of the places you checked off in the second set and write them under “My SURVIVE Locations” below.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-857">My THRIVE Locations: ___________________________</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-858">My NEUTRAL Locations: _________________________</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-859">My SURVIVE Locations: __________________________</p>
<p class="eb29bodytextindentlinespace" id="calibre_link-860"><span class="strong"><a id="calibre_link-861" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Now you know which invites to say yes to and which ones to skip. Put yourself in a position to be successful before you even arrive.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-862">You are much more likely to triumph with each of the behavior hacks if you try them at your thrive locations. And if you have to go to a neutral or survive event, no worries&mdash;the next two skills have you covered.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-863">Skill #2: Work a Room</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-864">Before you go to an event, imagine drawing your social interactions on a map, from the door you enter through to the location of your first conversation to the location of your last. Many of us follow the same paths over and over again without even realizing it.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-865">At the Science of People, we partner with event organizers who let us film and track people’s movement through the venues. At each event, we assign every attendee a number and then observe his or her interaction patterns. At the end of the night, we count how many connections they made, ask them how many business cards they received, and look at their connections on LinkedIn. We have found that the most successful connectors use specific patterns. <span class="strong">In other words, this social map can be hacked.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-866">Here is a map of a typical social event:</p>
<div class="landscape_medium" id="calibre_link-867"><img src="images/000016.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-360" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-868"><a id="calibre_link-869" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Whether you’re at a networking event, holiday party, wedding, dinner at a friend’s house, or in a conference ballroom, most events have this basic setup. There is a check-in area or a table to drop off gifts. You can easily spot the bathroom and the bar or food area. There are usually a few people you recognize&mdash;maybe colleagues, friends, or acquaintances gathered and already catching up. And of course, the host or boss is milling around the room.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-870">Let’s reimagine Truman’s social map at the 1944 convention:</p>
<div class="landscape_medium" id="calibre_link-871"><img src="images/000017.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-872" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-873">An audience sat before a big stage. Private meeting rooms were in the back.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-874">Most of the candidates devoted their energies to getting onstage before roaming through the audience to do obligatory schmoozing. Their map looked like this:</p>
<div class="landscape_medium" id="calibre_link-875"><img src="images/000018.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-876" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-877"><a id="calibre_link-878" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>To be effective and win votes, the shy Truman had to avoid both the typically traversed path and his own personal traps. The <em class="calibre6">X</em>s mark potential traps:</p>
<div class="landscape_medium" id="calibre_link-879"><img src="images/000019.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-880" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-881">Truman did his networking at the end of a long hallway on the side of the stage and in the privacy of Room H. I call locations that work to our strengths social sweet spots. On the next map, a star marks the sweet spot.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-882"><a id="calibre_link-883" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>All Truman had to do was follow his sweet spots to work the room in his favor.</p>
<div class="landscape_medium" id="calibre_link-884"><img src="images/000020.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-885" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-886">I want you to do the same thing. Let’s revisit the typical social map. I split every event up into three basic zones: the Start Zone, the Social Zone, and the Side Zone.</p>
<div class="landscape_medium" id="calibre_link-887"><img src="images/000021.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-888" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-889"><span class="strong">The Start Zone</span> is the starting point at all events. Emotionally, it’s the place where nerves are running highest. When people have just arrived, <a id="calibre_link-890" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>they’re usually juggling lots of thoughts. They are running late, checking in, taking off their coats, surveying the room, seeing if they know anyone, worrying about first impressions, silencing their phones, running to the bathroom, or praying for a good time.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-891">The biggest mistake I see at events is when people hover at the boundary of the Start Zone. It’s a social trap. You’re catching people at a confidence low. We noticed that the people who collected the least amount of business cards tried to pounce on people right in the Start Zone. What they didn’t realize was that they were trying to connect with people who weren’t open to connection yet.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-892">When you approach someone before they get oriented to an event, they are not only more distracted during your conversation, but they will also be looking over your head to scope out the room and find people they know&mdash;you’ll have a much harder time engaging in eye contact. They are also more likely to excuse themselves to get their drink, grab some food, say hi to the host, or go to the bathroom&mdash;and less likely to be receptive to anything you have to say.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-893"><span class="strong">The Side Zone</span> is also filled with secret traps that people often fall into. I call it the Side Zone because we noticed that when people fall into these traps, they become sidelined and don’t get to meet many new people. The first trap in the Side Zone is an easy one to remember: the bathroom. Sure, go to the bathroom, but don’t hover outside it. It’s creepy.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-894">The second Side Zone trap is making a beeline for the food and then floating around it all night. This isn’t a terrible trap, but it isn’t a great place to plant yourself. Not only will you eat too much and contend with a food baby all night, but you will also make it hard for other people to get their food and eat. It’s difficult to strike up conversations when people are trying to load up their plates, almost impossible to shake hands, and makes for awkward chatting-while-chewing moments.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-895">The third Side Zone trap is immediately going to people you know. Once you join up with your colleagues, friends, or acquaintances, it is incredibly challenging to get out and meet new people. The best thing to do is wave or give your friends a quick hug when you arrive, and then say you will circle back to them. You can hang out with them as the crowd thins out, but capitalize on your fresh energy at the beginning of an event to hit the Social Zone.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-896"><a id="calibre_link-897" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Here are the traps to avoid:</p>
<div class="landscape_medium" id="calibre_link-898"><img src="images/000022.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-361" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-899"><span class="strong">The Social Zone</span> is where the magic happens. First, the best place to start working a room is right where people exit the bar. By the time they’re here, the emotional, high-anxiety feeling of the Start Zone will have died down. Drinks in hand, people are ready to mingle, if not desperate to have someone to talk to. <span class="strong">You become their savior if you rescue them from drinking alone.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-900">There are two sweet spots on either end of the bar. At our networking events, we noticed the people who collected the most business cards and had the most connections on LinkedIn dominated these sweet spots (and never ran out of people to talk to). Your opening line can be contextual: “How do you like the wine tonight?” Or just, “Hey, cheers! I’m Vanessa …”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-901">The other great sweet spot in the Social Zone is right near the host. Once you have your drink, you can continue to work the room by saying a brief hello and thank-you to the host. You can also ask them to introduce you around before they carry on greeting people. You can say, “Thank you so much for having me! This looks like a great group. Anyone I should meet?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-902">After they have introduced you, let them do their hosting duties, but if possible, stay in their line of sight. I do this when I don’t know many <a id="calibre_link-903" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>people, because the host is more likely to see me while talking to someone and say, “Hey, you should meet my friend Vanessa. Vanessa, come over here!” Score!</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-904">While I don’t recommend standing around the food, hidden sweet spots are at the couches or bar tables where people are already eating. They are often hoping for someone like you to set their plate down beside theirs. Something like, “Hey, can I join you while you eat?” works well.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-905"><span class="strong">Bonus:</span> If you are an introvert and don’t like big groups, I highly recommend being what I call a Grazer. Instead of hitting the buffet once for a heaping plate, go up first for appetizers, again for the main course, and then again for seconds or dessert. Why? This is an easy way to take a break from a conversation or move to a new one-on-one.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-906">I’m a Grazer myself. If I need a longer break, I’ll go to the bathroom and refill my drink, too. Conserving my social energy helps me have multiple quality conversations in one night.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-907">In summary, work a room by hitting your social sweet spots and avoiding common traps. This map will help you optimize meeting people at events:</p>

<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-927">Skill #3: Know Your Team</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-928">About two weeks after an online body language course I taught went viral, I got a random e-mail from a guy who wanted to give me some unsolicited advice. He told me&mdash;in not very nice words&mdash;that he thought I should wear a business suit in my videos (in most of my videos I wear a button-down or a dress). He said I didn’t look “professional enough” and “business wear would appeal to more students.” He also advised against using jokes, as they “distract from the message.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-929">I panicked. I immediately began to think about reshooting my videos to look more formal. Should I start from scratch? Try to edit out clips piece by piece? Devastated, I asked some mentors for advice.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-930">Right after I told them the story, one of my mentors asked me, “Vanessa, why are you listening to this guy? Is he one of your people?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-931">I had no idea what he meant by “my people.” He explained, “Your goal is not to reach every person&mdash;it’s to reach the right people. If this guy gets distracted by what you are wearing, he is not one of the right people.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-932">This was a turning point for me and my business. I began to define my ideal student very specifically. Surveys and interviews told me that the people who bought my courses are above average in all areas. They are high performers with above-average intelligence and a super-busy schedule. My goal is simply to help as many of them as possible. Instead of going after every type of student, I started to target my type of student.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-933">With this ideal customer in mind, I began to create short, digestible videos power-packed with actionable tips. If a video wasn’t supercharged with valuable intel or was too wordy, I didn’t post it. Within a few months, our business started snowballing. Our YouTube channel views ballooned <a id="calibre_link-934" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>to over nine million. Our Twitter following grew by a factor of twelve. As of this writing, we have over 132,000 students in our online courses and over 104,000 in our online community. This only worked because I knew exactly who I was looking for. I found my people.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-935">Whether you are trying to find ideal clients, a great partner, or friends who bring out your best self, you have to make sure you are with the <em class="calibre6">right</em> people. You can take the Superman approach, stealthily preventing awkwardness and optimizing your interactions on your own. Or you can partner up. Batman has Robin, Iron Man has Jarvis, and Bert has Ernie. Better yet, you could join the Avengers and have a team to support you.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-963">Whether you are a quiet, contemplative conversationalist or a wild, silly party animal, you can succeed by playing to your strengths.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-964">When Truman was an unknown senator, for instance, he came up with an ingenious plan for climbing the ladder. The obvious strategy was to speak out on the Senate floor, but Truman preferred research to rhetorical flourishes, so he played the cards he had. He wrote in his memoirs: “Sitting as a ‘hearing committee’ is a dull, boresome procedure and it <a id="calibre_link-965" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>requires patience and persistence, so I soon became the ‘patient and persistent’ member of the subcommittee.”<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-217" href="#calibre_link-45" class="calibre4 pcalibre">10</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-966">His Social Game Plan was two-pronged. First, he threw himself into researching a topic he knew well from his experience on the railroad: transportation. Then he spent hours in the Library of Congress learning every arcane detail. Second, he built a relationship with a person with similar interests and goals. His Riser was Senator Burton K. Wheeler, the chairman of the Interstate Commerce Committee at the time. As Truman showed off his transportation knowledge in committees, he began to level up his relationship with Senator Wheeler. Finally, after Truman dutifully attended many meetings, Wheeler made Truman a formal subcommittee member. Not long after, Wheeler promoted him to vice chairman of the committee. Other senators noticed his work ethic and unique approach for dealing with people&mdash;and it carried him all the way to the White House. Even though Truman might not have been the most traditionally charismatic of individuals, he optimized his skills, mapped out his goals, and worked the right people.</p>

<h3 class="eb04mainheadclosedtitle" id="calibre_link-986">How to make a killer first impression</h3>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-987">The audience sits in hushed anticipation. The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra is already assembled onstage, tuning their instruments expectantly. The sold-out Heinz Hall is filled with 2,676 people. Everyone is waiting for conductor Arild Remmereit to take the stage.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-988">The problem is that Remmereit is not supposed to be here. The audience knows it, the orchestra knows it, and Remmereit certainly knows it. When the famed German conductor Christoph von Dohnányi became ill a few days before the show, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra had to find an immediate replacement. They turned to Remmereit.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-219" href="#calibre_link-47" class="calibre4 pcalibre">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-989">In a matter of days, Remmereit, a tall, energetic Norwegian, had to find a way to learn and conduct Dohnáyi’s entire program with an orchestra he had never worked with before. Of the three scheduled pieces in the program, Remmereit had only ever conducted one before in concert.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-990">When I interviewed Remmereit, he confessed, “Before walking out I was incredibly nervous and was going on almost no sleep to get ready for the performance.”<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-220" href="#calibre_link-48" class="calibre4 pcalibre">2</a></sup> To add even more pressure, <em class="calibre6">New York Times</em> reviewer James R. Oestreich was in the audience.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-991">As Remmereit finally takes the stage, the audience holds its breath. He has only a few seconds to make a strong first impression. For Remmereit it’s all about “finding a way to create trust.” He has to convince the audience that he can lead them through a new set and show the orchestra they should follow him.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-992">“He approached the podium like a diffident schoolboy. But once there he showed utter self-assurance, using clear and wide-ranging gestures,” observed Oestreich.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-221" href="#calibre_link-49" class="calibre4 pcalibre">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-993"><a id="calibre_link-994" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Remmereit leads the orchestra through a sensational performance of Wagner’s <em class="calibre6">Siegfried Idyll</em> and then a dynamic reading of Schumann’s Fourth Symphony. He finishes with Brahms’s Second Piano Concerto and finally a Chopin waltz as the encore. The audience is thrilled.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-995">“The only thing listeners seemed to want to talk about afterward was Mr. Remmereit,” reported Oestreich. “Mr. Remmereit radiated a joy in music-making, several listeners said. Inevitably, his boyish good looks, expressive podium manner and understated charisma were noted, but so was what some perceived as an unusual rapport between conductor and players.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-996">The news of Remmereit’s magnetic performance spread. He was quickly re-hired in Pittsburgh and made additional debuts with the Baltimore Symphony, Milan’s Filarmonica della Scala, Munich Philharmonic, and the Vienna Symphony.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-997">“The musicians know within five minutes whether a new conductor is any good or not,” he said later.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-222" href="#calibre_link-50" class="calibre4 pcalibre">4</a></sup> What did he do right in those first five minutes?</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-998">THE SCIENCE OF FIRST IMPRESSIONS</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-999">Have you ever met someone who you just clicked with&mdash;within the first few seconds you somehow knew that you would get along? Have you ever met someone who rankled you right from the start&mdash;you don’t know exactly what it was, but something about them just bothered you?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1000">Whether we like to admit it or not, we decide if we like someone, if we trust someone, and if we want a relationship with someone within the first few seconds of meeting them.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-223" href="#calibre_link-51" class="calibre4 pcalibre">5</a></sup> However, we rarely think about our first impressions. And if we do, we aren’t quite sure how to make them better. So we practice what we want to say, we plan witty jokes, and hope for the best when it comes to those early moments.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1001">Researchers Nalini Ambady and Robert Rosenthal at Harvard University wanted to test the power of our snap judgments. They decided to look at students’ perceptions of their professors.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-224" href="#calibre_link-52" class="calibre4 pcalibre">6</a></sup> Our judgments of teachers <em class="calibre6">should</em> only be made based on their actual teaching content&mdash;not on their looks, behavior, or presence. However, this is not how we operate.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1002">For the experiment, Ambady and Rosenthal showed muted ten-second video clips of professors teaching to outside participants, who rated the teachers on fifteen dimensions of effectiveness, including warmth, optimism, and professionalism. The evaluators had to make judgments based entirely on nonverbal cues.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1003"><a id="calibre_link-1004" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Ambady and Rosenthal looked at the results and wondered if they could change the ratings by shortening the clips. So they cut the clips from ten seconds to five seconds. The ratings did not change. Then they cut the clips from five seconds to two seconds. <span class="strong">The ratings still did not change.</span> They concluded that we make a snap judgment in the first two seconds of meeting someone and we rarely adjust it&mdash;even when we get more information. <span class="strong">We decide if we believe someone, if we like someone, and if we trust someone before we have even heard him or her speak.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1005">What character judgments could you confidently make after watching someone move in a room for two seconds? Could you guess how honest they are? How nice? How supportive? Even though you would have very little content to judge, you already mentally ask and answer these questions within seconds of meeting someone. And the crazy part is you’re pretty accurate!</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1006">Here’s the most interesting part of the study. Ambady and Rosenthal took the ratings from each of these clips and compared them to the student evaluations of these same teachers after an entire semester of classes. Again, they were surprisingly similar. <span class="strong">Teachers who got poor rankings from the two-second clips also got low rankings from students who took a semester’s worth of classes.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1007">You can bet that those teachers spent many hours agonizing over their curriculum, practicing their teaching method, and spending time bonding with students before and after classes. According to Ambady and Rosenthal, this is not what really mattered. Students decide how effective teachers are within the first few seconds of walking into the room. The same thing happens to Remmereit when he takes the stage. And the same thing happens to you when you enter a room.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1008">Intimidated by the speed of the first impression? Don’t be! This is good news. If it takes only a few seconds to convince someone you are worth talking to, let’s supercharge these first few seconds. <span class="strong">You can use the first impression to hack an entire interaction.</span></p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-1009">LEVELING UP</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1010">First impressions are a survival mechanism. When you meet a new person, you have to quickly decide if you want them in your life. Ever heard of the fight-or-flight response? It is a way your body instinctively reacts to external stimuli and decides if you should stay or flee. This is why first impressions are so swift and decisive.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1011"><a id="calibre_link-1012" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>We are trying to answer three basic questions about a new person during the first few moments of an interaction.</p>
<ul class="none1" id="calibre_link-1013">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1014"><span class="strong">Level One:</span> Are you friend or foe? This is our subconscious personal safety check. We’re thinking, “Darlin’ you got to let me know. Should I stay or should I go?”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1015"><span class="strong">Level Two:</span> Are you a winner or loser? When we first meet someone, we want to quickly assess their confidence&mdash;do they look like a leader or a follower?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1016"><span class="strong">Level Three:</span> Are you an ally or an enemy? It’s one thing to see someone as nonthreatening, but the last level is when you decide whether someone should be on your team. Your brain wants to know if this person likes you enough to back you up.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1017">When someone successfully answers all three questions, we “level up” and trust them more. Strangers become acquaintances. Acquaintances become friends. Prospects become clients. (These are, of course, the three questions people are also trying to quickly answer about <em class="calibre6">you</em>.) How does this phenomenon play out when a speaker is in front of a big audience? In a TED Talk, for example?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1018">I’m a TED Talk junkie. Most days, I find a juicy talk at lunch to accompany my sandwich. One day, I typed “leadership” into the search bar and two videos popped up. One was “How Great Leaders Inspire Action” by Simon Sinek, and the other was “Learning from Leadership’s Missing Manual” by Fields Wicker-Miurin.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1019">Both talks were about eighteen minutes long. Both talks came out in September 2009. Both talks were given by respected thought leaders in their field. But there was one difference&mdash;and it was a big one. Sinek’s talk had 24,905,052 views, while Wicker-Miurin’s had only 725,663. Why such a big discrepancy? By virtue of being selected for TED Talks, both speakers were vetted prior to their presentation. TED goes to great lengths to keep their presentation style consistent and pick the best speakers from around the world. All of these speakers have amazing ideas. What gives?<a id="calibre_link-409" class="footnote_link pcalibre" type="noteref" href="#calibre_link-53">fn1</a> I designed a research experiment in our lab to find out.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1020"><a id="calibre_link-1021" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>We wanted to see if Ambady and Rosenthal’s findings could be applied to TED. First, we had a group of participants watch full-length TED Talks and give each speaker a score on credibility, charisma, intelligence, and overall performance. Participants were not able to see the view counts (to avoid skewing their perceptions) and we verified they had not seen the talks before.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1022">Next, we gave scoring sheets to a second group, who saw seven-second clips of the same TED Talks. Guess what? No significant difference in opinion.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1023">Is it possible that we decide if we are going to like a TED Talk within the first seven seconds? How do the top TED Talkers pass through all three levels of trust so quickly?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1024">We had our coders analyze hundreds of hours of TED Talks looking for differences between the least and most viewed videos. We counted hand gestures and measured vocal variety, smiling, and body movement. We found that there were patterns. <span class="strong">The power of our first impression lies not in</span> <span class="bolditalic">what</span> <span class="strong">we say, but</span> <span class="bolditalic">how</span> <span class="strong">we say it.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1025"><span class="strong">The most popular TED Talkers leveled up their audiences before even getting to their big idea. They did this by using what I call:</span></p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-1026" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturecenter" id="calibre_link-1027"><span class="strong">HACK #2: The Triple Threat</span></p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturecenter" id="calibre_link-1028"><span class="strong">Make a powerful first impression by nonverbally hacking all three levels of trust.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1029">In showbiz, performers are a Triple Threat when they can act, sing, and dance. With a first impression, you are a Triple Threat when you use your hands, your posture, and your eye contact. These are the three nonverbal weapons you can use to pass through all three levels of trust. These are what Arild Remmereit uses when he enters the stage. They are what the top TED Talkers use on that little red carpet. And they are what you should use anytime you are interacting with someone.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-1030">Skill #1: Use Your Hands</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1031">The top TED Talkers use a very specific mechanism to instantly build trust with their audience: hand gestures.</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1032" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1033">The least popular TED Talkers used an average of <span class="strong">272</span> hand gestures&mdash;yes, our coders painstakingly counted every single one.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1034"><a id="calibre_link-1035" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>The most popular TED Talkers used an average of <span class="strong">465</span> hand gestures&mdash;that’s almost double!</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1036">Temple Grandin, Simon Sinek, and Jane McGonigal topped the hand gesture charts with over <span class="strong">600</span> gestures in just eighteen minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1037">This effect isn’t specific to TED Talks. Robert Gifford, Cheuk Fan Ng, and Margaret Wilkinson found that job candidates who use more hand gestures in their interviews are more likely to get hired.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-225" href="#calibre_link-54" class="calibre4 pcalibre">7</a></sup> Why do hand gestures have such an impact? Hands show intention.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1038">Think back to caveman days for a moment. When a stranger approached our caveman ancestors, the best way to tell if the stranger had good or bad intentions was to look at their hands. Were they carrying a rock or a spear? As the stranger introduced themselves, our ancestors watched their gestures to make sure they weren’t going to reach out and attack or steal precious belongings. Even though in modern times we aren’t often subjected to physical harm, this survival mechanism remains. This is why in most cultures we shake hands as a way of greeting. And why the first thing police officers yell at criminals is “Get your hands up!”</p>

<h5 class="box_title" id="calibre_link-1040"><span class="strong">FAST FACT BOX</span></h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1041">Most people think that we look at the eyes or the smile when we first meet someone. We don’t realize how important hands are.</p>
<div class="landscape_medium" id="calibre_link-1042"><img src="images/000024.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-362" class="calibre1" /></div>
</div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1043"><a id="calibre_link-1044" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>When someone can see your hands, they feel more at ease and are more likely to befriend you. This is an easy one to implement. When you walk into a room or are waiting to meet someone, keep your hands out of your pockets.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1045">I know, I know, putting your hands in your pockets is so comfortable! It’s so casual! It’s so cowboy! I don’t mean to get drastic, but pockets are <em class="calibre6">murderers</em> of rapport. Yeah, I said murderers. That’s because the absolute easiest thing you can do to improve your first impression is to keep your hands visible. Every time you put your hand in your pocket, just scream “MURDERER!” in your head. That will help you remember.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1046">Pockets aren’t the only problem. Don’t let desks, purses, or laptops block your friend-makers. Whenever possible, keep your hands above the desk in a boardroom, on the table during a coffee meeting, and out of your purse during an event.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1047">Getting handsy is a one-two punch for trust. First, you have your hands visible, and then you go in for the perfect handshake.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-1048"><span class="bolditalic">How to Give a Perfect Handshake</span></h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1049">Are you friend or foe? A handshake shows a stranger you are safe enough to go palm to palm. But not all handshakes are created equal. Here are the top things you need to know about a great handshake:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1050" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1051"><span class="strong">Dry:</span> Nothing is worse than a slimy handshake. If you get nervous and your palms sweat, use my favorite “napkin wrap” trick. When you get to an event, order a drink from the bar and wrap a napkin around the glass. Hold this with your handshaking hand so the napkin catches your sweat before you shake.</li>
</ul>
<div class="landscape_small" id="calibre_link-1052"><img src="images/000025.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-1053" class="calibre1" /></div>
<ul id="calibre_link-1054" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1055"><span class="strong"><a id="calibre_link-1056" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Vertical:</span> Always keep your hand vertical with your thumb toward the sky. Offering your palm up is a nonverbal submissive or weak gesture. And forcing someone into the palm-up position by putting your hand out palm down can be seen as domineering and controlling.</li>
</ul>
<div class="landscape_medium" id="calibre_link-1057"><img src="images/000026.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-1058" class="calibre1" /></div>
<ul id="calibre_link-1059" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1060"><span class="strong">Firm:</span> Have you ever squeezed a peach to see if it was ripe? This is kind of the effect you want when shaking a hand, because everyone has slightly different ideas of firmness. With a peach, you squeeze until you feel a tiny bit of resistance. If it’s really ripe, this comes fast and you stop squeezing. If it’s not ready to be eaten, you can squeeze pretty hard without bruising the fruit. Same goes for people. Squeeze until you feel their muscles tighten, and then stop. And for goodness’ sake, never give someone a limp hand a.k.a. the “dead fish”&mdash;it’s deadly for rapport.<a id="calibre_link-410" class="footnote_link pcalibre" type="noteref" href="#calibre_link-55">fn2</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1061">Never, ever skip a handshake. Don’t replace it with a wave or a high five or&mdash;heaven forbid&mdash;a fist bump. Why? The moment we have skin-to-skin touch with someone, our body produces something called oxytocin.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1062"><span class="strong">Oxytocin is the connection hormone.</span> Researcher Paul Zak discovered the power of this little hormone, which he calls “the moral molecule,” <a id="calibre_link-1063" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>to facilitate trust&mdash;this is why it is an essential part of answering the question “friend or foe?” Two million people have viewed his TED Talk. In it, he describes conducting experiments with oxytocin in which he manipulated the trust of participants simply by giving them a dose of the hormone.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1064">When you shake hands with someone, your body produces the exact hormone you both need to build trust&mdash;and then a deeper connection.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1065"><span class="strong">Bottom Line:</span> Keep your hands visible. Never skip a handshake.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-1066">Skill #2: Be a Winner</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1067">Answer the following question:</p>
<p class="list_head" id="calibre_link-1068"><span class="strong">What is the most influential factor for professionals who want to earn the trust of potential clients?</span></p>
<ol class="alpha1_nts" id="calibre_link-1069">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1070" value="1">Being an established, proven expert</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1071" value="2">Having a high degree of confidence</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1072" value="3">Demonstrating advanced expertise in their area</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1073" value="4">Having a well-respected reputation</li>
</ol>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1074">What did you guess? If you guessed “B. Having a high degree of confidence,” you are correct! According to a major study done by Carnegie Mellon University,<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-226" href="#calibre_link-56" class="calibre4 pcalibre">8</a></sup> a professional’s confidence is more important than that professional’s reputation, skill set, or history!</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1075">Why is confidence so important? As humans, we are constantly looking for winners.</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-1076" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-1077"><span class="strong">Winner:</span> <em class="calibre6">n.</em> Victor; a person likely to be successful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1078">We like to have winners on our team. We like to be associated with winners. We like to be led by winners. Whether we like it or not, in the first few seconds of an interaction, we are trying to decide if the person we are speaking with looks more like a winner or more like a loser. The question is: What does a winner look like?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1079">Researchers Jessica Tracy and David Matsumoto wanted to know if there are universal winner and loser behaviors. Specifically, they examined how humans respond to success and failure. To do this, they compared how Olympic athletes behave after they win or lose a race. Do sighted, <a id="calibre_link-1080" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>blind, and congenitally blind (blind since birth) athletes display the same forms of pride and shame after a match? The answer is yes&mdash;<span class="strong">across cultures, the behavior of winning and losing athletes was the same.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1081">Even congenitally blind athletes, who have never seen an athlete finish a race or suffer a crushing defeat, somehow mimic the gestures of other athletes.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-227" href="#calibre_link-57" class="calibre4 pcalibre">9</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1082">Winners typically take up as much space as physically possible. Frequently called “Power Posing” this is when we raise our arms over our head, expand our chest, and tilt our head up:</p>
<div class="landscape_large1" id="calibre_link-1083"><img src="images/000027.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-379" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1084">Losing athletes take up as little physical space as possible. Also known as “Low Power Posing,” defeated athletes usually bow their head, slump their shoulders, and pin their arms tightly to their sides.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1085">The fact that athletes instinctively use the same body language shows us how innately programmed we are to broadcast victory and defeat nonverbally. But why? Tracy and Matsumoto propose that pride and shame factor significantly in social signaling, providing rich information we use to make judgments of ourselves and others.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1086">Like athletes, when we are proud, we want people to notice us, so we take up space. When we feel defeated, we try to deflect attention by taking up as little space as possible.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1087">Now, as much as I want you to look like a winner, the traditional winner’s pose is a bit much for everyday interactions. It would be odd if you <a id="calibre_link-1088" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>ran into your meetings or dates like you just crossed a finish line&mdash;highly powerful, but a bit socially aggressive.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1089">Instead, I use something I call the Launch Stance. This is a slightly toned-down version of the winner’s posture. <span class="strong">Whenever you are talking to people, use your Launch Stance:</span></p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1090" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1091">Keep your shoulders down and back.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1092">Aim your chin, chest, and forehead straight in front of you or slightly up.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1093">Keep space between your arms and torso.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1094">Make sure your hands are visible.</li>
</ul>
<div class="landscape_large1" id="calibre_link-1095"><img src="images/000028.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-1096" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1097">Body language is the fastest way you can showcase confidence to others and hack your winning first impression.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1098"><span class="strong">Special Note:</span> Sometimes we accidentally go into loser body language when we check our phones. Think about it: You bow your head, cross your arms in front of your chest, pin your arms tightly to your sides, and slump your shoulders in. What do most of us do while waiting for a client or before going into a meeting? We check our phones! This terrible cycle has to stop now!</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1099">If possible, chat with colleagues, look calmly around the waiting room, or read a newspaper before an important engagement. If you want to check your phone, just do it like a winner. Pivot the phone out and up to align with the Launch Stance:</p>
<div class="landscape_default" id="calibre_link-1100"><img src="images/000029.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-1101" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1102"><span class="strong"><a id="calibre_link-1103" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Bottom Line:</span> Stand like a winner. Look like a winner. Interact like a winner.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-1104">Skill #3: Engage with Eye Contact</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1105">Once we have decided someone is both trustworthy and a winner, we want to know if they should be on our team or not. This is the differentiator between a good first impression and a great one. Specifically, we are looking for indicators of alliance. Does this person like me? Would this person respect my opinion? Will this person include me? Sure, we like people who are trustworthy and confident, but if we don’t think they will respect us, we never level them up.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1106">Most TED Talkers pass only the first two levels. They may indicate their trustworthiness with hand gestures and capture confidence with a broad stance. However, most don’t know how to make the individuals in their audience feel cared for. They speak to the cameras, they speak to the slides, but they don’t speak to YOU.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1107">How do you communicate your desire for an alliance? Imagine you’re sipping on coffee during an afternoon break in a park. You see a mother reading a book on a blanket beside her toddler. The toddler spots a duck, so he looks up at his mom and says, “Look, a duck!” The mother doesn’t hear him, so her son pulls on her hand and says louder, “Mom! Look, I see a duck!” This time, Mom registers it and murmurs, “Uh-huh, nice, sweetie.” But the toddler isn’t fooled. His mom wasn’t <em class="calibre6">really</em> paying attention. So he starts jumping and tugging on his mother’s arm, chanting “Mom, Mom, Mom, MOM, MOM! MOM!!” Finally, right as the toddler begins to cry, the mother puts her book down, looks at her son and says, “What is it?” The toddler smiles and points at the duck. “Oh!” she exclaims, and looks over at <a id="calibre_link-1108" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>the duck with him. “How great! You love ducks,” she says, turning to him and smiling. He sighs happily, and they both resume relaxing.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1109">What happened? The toddler just wanted someone to share an experience with. Like all of us, he wanted an alliance. The best TED Talkers act much like a doting mother with their audience. They make eye contact with specific faces in the crowd and speak directly to them&mdash;making everyone watching feel like they truly matter. The sense of togetherness you get during a stellar TED Talk comes when you feel you are experiencing the slides and presentation along with the speaker. Viral TED Talkers speak <em class="calibre6">to</em> you, not <em class="calibre6">at</em> you.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1110">One of the most powerful examples of eye contact is in a video done by activist Jae West and her team at Liberators International. Their organization’s stated mission on their website: “We aim to coordinate, record and distribute monthly global acts of freedom.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1111">Their YouTube channel is filled with many daring acts of kindness and unique public service announcements. In one video, the Liberators lead Australian subway passengers to sing an impromptu rendition of “Over the Rainbow.” In another video, a woman stands in her underwear on a public street blindfolded. She asks people to draw hearts on her body with a permanent marker to raise awareness for eating disorders.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-228" href="#calibre_link-58" class="calibre4 pcalibre">10</a></sup><a id="calibre_link-411" class="footnote_link pcalibre" type="noteref" href="#calibre_link-59">fn3</a></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1112">One of their most popular videos is called “The World’s Biggest Eye Contact Experiment.” In this video, Liberators ask strangers to participate in one minute of sustained eye contact with another stranger. “We were definitely nervous going into it … it’s quite confronting to stare a stranger in the eye and allow yourself to be vulnerable,” said West.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1113">The results were overwhelming. Over 100,000 people participated in the experiment in 156 cities around the world. After just one minute of eye contact, stranger after stranger ended their moment in tears, hugs, and astonishment. As West concluded, “Holding eye contact with another person can evoke many feelings … it calls on true courage to trust another being.”<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-229" href="#calibre_link-60" class="calibre4 pcalibre">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1114">Why is eye contact so powerful? It produces oxytocin, the chemical foundation for trust. We’re programmed to interpret it as a nonverbal signal of goodwill. When you like someone, you look at them more. Author Allan Pease describes it this way:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-1115" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-1116"><a id="calibre_link-1117" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>When person A likes person B, he will look at him a lot. This causes B to think that A likes him, so B will like A in return. In other words, in most cultures, to build a good rapport with another person, your gaze should meet theirs about 60 to 70 percent of the time. This will also cause them to begin to like you. It is not surprising, therefore, that the nervous, timid person who meets our gaze less than one third of the time is rarely trusted.<sup class="ebsup1"><a id="calibre_link-230" href="#calibre_link-61" class="calibre4 pcalibre">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1118">In those first few seconds, it’s especially important that you override the impulse to look away shyly.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1119">You may be worrying that you’ll use <em class="calibre6">too</em> much eye contact. How much is ideal? You may remember this question from the PQ quiz:</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1120"><span class="strong">In the average conversation, people typically hold eye contact what percent of the time?</span></p>
<ol id="calibre_link-1121" class="calibre9">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1122" value="1">31 percent</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1123" value="2">51 percent</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1124" value="3">61 percent</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1125" value="4">91 percent</li>
</ol>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1126">I have asked this question to hundreds of audiences. The answers are usually evenly split. People have completely different ideas about how much eye contact is normal.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1127">British social psychologist Dr. Michael Argyle found that when Westerners and Europeans are in conversation, they tend to hold eye contact for an average of <span class="strong">61 percent of the time</span> (answer C). He found that 41 percent occurs while talking and 75 percent while listening.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-231" href="#calibre_link-62" class="calibre4 pcalibre">13</a></sup> Next time you’re talking to someone, try to objectively evaluate where you tend to fall on the spectrum. Some other things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1128" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1129">Notice their eye color.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1130">Don’t look over their head to scope out the scene.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1131">Hold eye contact for 60 to 70 percent of the time.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1132"><span class="strong">Bottom Line:</span> Use eye contact to build trust. Gaze to produce connection.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-1133"><a id="calibre_link-1134" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>THE ULTIMATE SOCIAL WEAPON</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1135">Making a killer first impression is not about banishing social anxiety once and for all. Before Arild Remmereit takes the stage, he still feels incredibly nervous. Famed TED Talker Dr. Brené Brown says giving her TED Talk was terrifying&mdash;and her talk is one of the most viewed TED videos of all time.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1136">“One of the most anxiety-provoking experiences of my career was speaking at the TED Conference in Long Beach. In addition to all the normal fears associated with giving a filmed, eighteen-minute talk in front of an intensely successful and high-expectation audience, I was the closing speaker for the entire event,” recalled Brown.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1137">However, Brown took the stage like a champion, her shoulders back and her hands out. Then she made sure she could see her audience. “When I finally walked onto the stage the first thing I did was make eye contact with several people in the audience. I asked the stage managers to bring up the houselights so I could see people. I needed to feel connected,” said Brown.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-232" href="#calibre_link-63" class="calibre4 pcalibre">14</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1138">The Triple Threat is a tool you can turn to when your nerves are high. It will both simplify the process of making good first impressions&mdash;once you understand the science, it’s not so big and scary&mdash;and allow you to relax by living more in the moment. Along with the most popular TED Talkers and Remmereits, you can make your first few seconds count by nonverbally showing your audience: You can trust me, I have a winning idea, and I’m here to help you. That’s how we become memorable.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-1139">CHALLENGES</h5>
<ol id="calibre_link-1140" class="calibre9">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1141" value="1">Don’t guess on your handshake. Do a handshake audit with a trusted friend or colleague&mdash;ask for honest feedback to make sure your grip is just right.</li>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1157">In the heart of Bogotá, there are treasures. And Jeffer Carrillo Toscano is our treasure hunter. A small group of us diligently follow him as he weaves through the small cobblestone alleys that make up La Candelaria&mdash;one of the oldest neighborhoods in Colombia.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1158">“Keep your eyes peeled,” he says, pointing to the tops of Spanish colonial houses and crumbling baroque balconies, “they could be anywhere.” We climb up a set of narrow stairs, barely disturbing a family of napping kittens and stumble upon our first find. What are we looking for? Graffiti.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1159">Nestled between two boarded windows is one of the most beautiful pieces of art I have ever seen. An indigenous woman looks up at the sky as if in prayer or search of rain. It takes my breath away.</p>
<div class="portrait_default" id="calibre_link-1160"><img src="images/000030.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-363" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1161"><a id="calibre_link-1162" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Street after street, Jeffer points out drawings I never would have noticed before&mdash;a portrait on the side of a drainpipe, a mushroom on the corner of an art deco door, a tiny hummingbird next to a patio. As he walks and talks he is constantly surveying the group for interest. He notes when and where people take pictures, who says “Ooohh!” and who looks bored.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1163">In between streets he plays a memory game and tags each person’s name to where they are from&mdash;by the end he has all twenty-six names memorized. Then he asks each of us for our story. He wants to know what brings each person to his graffiti tour&mdash;not exactly the typical choice for a tourist.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1164">One by one he finds something relevant for each person on the tour. One woman works at an international nonprofit to preserve the rain forests of South America. To her delight, he brings her to a large mural depicting the Colombian rain forest.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1165">Jeffer then learns one of our group members is an American journalist. He weaves around the streets to show him a political graphic on the base of a cement slab. It shows a black-and-white image of Edward Snowden with the words “Hero or Traitor?” emblazoned in large block letters. The journalist is blown away and begins scribbling away in his notebook for his next story to send home.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1166">Without realizing it, Jeffer is tapping into a fundamental law of human behavior. He creates sparks. His ability to captivate attention has made his Bogotá Graffiti Tour the second-highest-rated activity on TripAdvisor and has been featured in the <em class="calibre6">New York Times</em> as a must-see if you have only thirty-six hours to spend in Bogotá.<a id="calibre_link-413" class="footnote_link pcalibre" type="noteref" href="#calibre_link-65">fn1</a></p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-1167">THE DEATH OF SMALL TALK</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1168">One of the greatest days of my childhood existence could be summed up in two words: Space Mountain. Every summer while I was growing up, my family went to Disneyland. This was the highlight of my year, and my siblings and I counted down the days until we could run through the perfectly manicured, cotton-candy-scented park with abandon.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1169">There was only one problem. In the beginning, I was not tall enough to go on the best rides&mdash;specifically, Space Mountain. I watched as the top of my older brother’s curly hair grazed the ominous height <a id="calibre_link-1170" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>requirement line. Then my parents left me to babysit my little sisters as the three of them went down the dark tunnel of excitement without us. I was stuck in the Tiki Room. The thrill of my day came when my youngest sister almost flew out of a spinning teacup because I dared her to not hold on (never, EVER tell Mom).</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1171">One glorious summer, the top of my pigtail reached that forbidding line. I strapped into my rocket car and gripped the sweaty safety bar. The next two minutes were life defining. Space Mountain blew my mind. All my life I had an inkling I had been missing out, but really I had no idea. The slow, monotonous humps of Dumbo the Flying Elephant did not even come close to comparing to the exhilarating dips and whirls of Space Mountain. The “speed” we reached on the Disneyland Railroad was laughable compared to the daredevil pace of a rocket! That day, my brother and I rode Space Mountain over and over again, and I swore I would never go back to the kiddie rides.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1172">This is exactly how it works with conversations. For most of our lives, we chitchat on the kiddie ride. Our conversations aren’t memorable because we aren’t very stimulated or excited. Our energy level during most small talk looks something like this:</p>
<div class="landscape_medium" id="calibre_link-1173"><img src="images/000031.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-1174" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1175">This is small talk. With no high peaks and no interesting hooks, our conversations come and go&mdash;we are lucky to remember our partner’s name, let alone what we talked about. I want to introduce the concept of Big Talk.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1176">Big Talk is like Space Mountain. You start with anticipation and roll easily through the conversation, laughing and hitting highs as it gets better and better. Our energy level looks like this:</p>
<div class="landscape_medium" id="calibre_link-1177"><img src="images/000032.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-1178" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1179"><a id="calibre_link-1180" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Like a great roller coaster, great conversations leave you feeling both exhilarated and hoping you’ll never have to experience small talk again.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1181">Now, the death of small talk requires some effort. Like any good people hack, Big Talk means skirting conversational norms, challenging chitchat status quo, and shirking social scripts. Roller coasters command a little extra height and so does Big Talk.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-1182">THE SCIENCE OF SPARKS</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1183">The reason why we love roller coasters is because of the peaks. The top of each summit gives us a rush as we await and enjoy the glee of the ride. Big Talk is marked by the same kind of emotional peaks. The best conversations have specific jolts of energy and excitement&mdash;I call these star moments “sparks.”</p>

<p class="eb20extrafeaturecenter" id="calibre_link-1189"><span class="strong">Use unique talking points to create pleasurable and memorable conversations.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1190">Big Talk has tons of sparks&mdash;lots of little bursts of pleasure that we remember. Have you ever had a great conversation with someone? Afterward, did you savor it&mdash;replaying the high points, rolling around the humorous moments over and over again in your head? This is because conversational sparks make us feel good.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1191">In the brain, sparks are marked by dopamine.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-234" href="#calibre_link-66" class="calibre4 pcalibre">1</a></sup> Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is released in the amygdala when we feel pleasure. When we get a birthday gift, praise from our boss, or a reward, dopamine floods our brain. Think about the joy you get when you walk into a store and the clerk tells you, “Free samples!” That feeling of excitement is pure dopamine.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1192">Here’s what’s interesting about dopamine: It helps your memory. Molecular biologist Dr. John Medina likens dopamine to a mental marker. He says, “Dopamine greatly aids memory and information processing. You can think of it like a Post-it note that reads ‘Remember this!’ Getting one’s brain to put a chemical Post-it note on a given piece of information means that information is going to be more robustly processed.”<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-235" href="#calibre_link-67" class="calibre4 pcalibre">2</a></sup> In other words, being memorable boils down to inducing chemical pleasure. <span class="strong">When you produce dopamine during a conversation, you not only give your partner more enjoyment, you are also assigned more significance, which increases your memorability.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1193">The question is: How do you spark dopamine during a conversation? I would love for you to keep little presents in your pockets like a birthday party magician, but that isn’t very practical&mdash;and business suits don’t have particularly roomy pockets. Instead, you can produce pleasure verbally. Presents don’t come only in colorfully wrapped packages. Rewards don’t need to have a dollar sign. Gratification doesn’t just come from physically feeling good.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1194">There are three ways to hack your conversations to make them both more pleasurable and more memorable. Let’s turn your small talk into Big Talk.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-1195">Step #1: Conversation Sparkers</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1196">One day I was sitting in the green room of a morning news show, nervously awaiting my segment. All of a sudden, in walked one of my favorite <a id="calibre_link-1197" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>writers&mdash;Elizabeth Gilbert, author of <em class="calibre6">Eat Pray Love</em> and <em class="calibre6">Big Magic</em>. I was stunned and immediately began racking my brain for something interesting to say. I was dying to talk to her, but had no idea what would pique her interest. What does one say to a literary icon, a bestselling author, and a personal hero? Should I ask about her book? No, too obvious. Should I ask where she is from? No, too bland. Should I just blurt out how much I love her books? No, too suck-uppy.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1198">Before I could work up my nerve, the other guest in the green room smiled at both of us and said, “Do you like soup?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1199">Okay, this is one conversation starter I would never have come up with on my own. But I was grateful. I stared at the other guest, wide-eyed at her courage, and held my breath&mdash;how on earth would Ms. Gilbert react? To my amazement, Elizabeth Gilbert (“Call me Liz,” she clarified immediately) clapped her hands and began telling us about her favorite winter soup recipes. We reminisced about Grandma-made stews and laughed about the perils of eating healthy while traveling. Who would have thought that a soup conversation starter would spark such a lively and fun discussion?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1200">I found out later that the other guest was a chef publishing a soup cookbook and Liz was on one of her West Coast book tours. I was doing a segment on the science of friendship&mdash;and we all had thirty minutes to kill before we went live on air. All we needed was a spark.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1201">Most conversations go something like this:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-1202" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1203">What do you do?</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1204">Oh, that’s nice. Where are you from?</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1205">Mmm, never been there. So, what brings you here?</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1206">Good, good. Well, I’m going to get another drink …</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1207">Boring! This conversation is the equivalent of sitting on a kiddie ride. There is almost no emotional stimulation, no sparks, no highs, just a slow roll to an anticlimactic ending where you desperately need hand sanitizer. It’s time to step up to Space Mountain.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1208">I get it&mdash;sometimes we’re lazy or plain afraid of tackling new topics. But what’s the point of following nearly identical social scripts every time you talk to someone? What’s the point of trying to talk to a new client if it’s so boring that they won’t remember it anyway? What’s the point of interacting on autopilot?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1209"><a id="calibre_link-1210" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Big Talk requires asking fresh questions that cause conversational sparks. I call these conversation “sparkers” in lieu of conversation “starters.” They ignite new ideas, introduce topics we have never thought about, and stimulate in-depth discussions.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1211">Why do we get pleasure from novelty?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1212">Neurobiologists Dr. Nico Bunzeck and Dr. Emrah Düzel conducted a study they called “The Oddball Experiments.”<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-236" href="#calibre_link-68" class="calibre4 pcalibre">3</a></sup> In this test, experimenters showed participants a series of images while scanning their brains in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine. Most of the images depicted the same face and the same scene. However, participants were intermittently shown a series of “oddball” images.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1213">The researchers measured blood flow to different areas of the brain as participants observed each image. They found that oddball images activate our brain’s “novelty center” (the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area). Here’s why novelty matters:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1214" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1215"><span class="strong">Memory and Learning:</span> The oddball images activated the area influenced by the hippocampus, which is the brain’s learning and memory center. Novelty makes our brain perk up, pay attention, and process the conversation better. Want people to remember <em class="calibre6">your</em> name? Spark excitement and novelty.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1216"><span class="strong">Pleasure:</span> This novelty center is linked to our dopamine pathways in the amygdala&mdash;the almond-shaped bundle of neurons near the base of the brain. New ideas and topics give us a nice bump of dopamine in this region, which makes us feel great.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1217"><span class="strong">Interest:</span> Dopamine also encourages us to seek even more rewards. In other words, a little bit of fresh conversation encourages both people to want to go deeper and explore more. Dr. Düzel explains, “When we see something new, we see it has a potential for rewarding us in some way. This potential that lies in new things motivates us to explore our environment for rewards.”<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-237" href="#calibre_link-69" class="calibre4 pcalibre">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1218"><span class="strong">If we abandon social scripts and push ourselves to use conversational sparks, we are more likely to enjoy our interactions and remember what was actually said.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1219">In 2016, we partnered with the organizations Mercy Corps, Society for Information Management, and Girls Inc. to run a set of speed networking <a id="calibre_link-1220" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>experiments. In these experiments, we randomly partnered over three hundred participants to test conversation starters. At each chair, participants have seven slips of paper waiting for them. Each card has a different conversation starter and a space for a rating.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1221">Once everyone is seated, we start the speed networking rounds. Each conversation starter gets one three-minute round. At the end of three minutes, we ring a bell and each participant rates the quality of the conversation produced&mdash;1 for boring, 5 for stellar. Here are the seven rounds. Can you guess which three were rated the highest?</p>
<ul class="none" id="calibre_link-1222">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1223">___ What’s your story?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1224">___ How are you?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1225">___ What was the highlight of your day?</li>

<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1229">___ What personal passion project are you working on?</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1230">There were clear winners. Here they are in order of highest rank to lowest:</p>
<ol id="calibre_link-1231" class="calibre9">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1232" value="1">What was the highlight of your day?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1233" value="2">What personal passion project are you working on?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1234" value="3">Have anything exciting coming up in your life?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1235" value="4">What’s your story?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1236" value="5">What brings you here?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1237" value="6">What do you do?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1238" value="7">How are you?</li>
</ol>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1239">Sometimes, we also do a “Grab Bag” round where we have people choose any of the seven previous conversation starters to ask and write down which one they used. The most popular choices for Grab Bag are “What personal passion project are you working on?” and “What’s your story?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1240">The problem is that the conversation starters we most often use&mdash;“What do you do?” and “How are you?”&mdash;are rated as the most boring. So why do we keep on using them?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1241"><a id="calibre_link-1242" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>We stick to social scripts out of habit. We use the same dull conversation starters over and over again because they are in our comfort zone. But you know what? Nothing spark-worthy ever happens in your comfort zone. <span class="strong">If you keep using social scripts, you will be stuck in small talk forever.</span></p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1271">Your typical “hello,” “hi,” and “hey” get terrible reply rates in direct messages. “Howdy,” “hola,” and even “yo” rank better.

They ignite some kind of spark.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-239" href="#calibre_link-72" class="calibre4 pcalibre">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1272">Don’t ask the same old boring questions. Look for topics that get people excited, make people interested, and create sparks.</p>

<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-1277">Step #2: Push Hot Buttons</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1278">One of the ways you can create conversational high points is by looking for someone’s hot-button issues. This is a topic, hobby, or activity that lights someone up. You know you have pushed a hot button when the other person:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1279" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1280">Begins nodding their head up and down as if to say, “Yes!”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1281">Murmurs in agreement with “Mmm-hmm”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1282">Leans in to hear more</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1283">Writes back a longer e-mail than usual</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1284">Exclaims in surprise with “Huh!” or “Wow!”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1285"><a id="calibre_link-1286" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Tells you, “Fascinating!” “Interesting,” or “Tell me more!”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1287">Raises their eyebrows&mdash;this is the universal signal of curiosity</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1288">Says, “Ooohh” or “Aahh”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1289">Smiles and uses more animated gestures</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1290">When any of these engagement cues happen, you know that you have just sparked some dopamine and pushed a hot button.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1291">This is what Jeffer Carrillo Toscano is looking for on his tours. He points things out or tells a story and looks to see if he has sparked any interest. If so, he goes into more detail.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1292">You can find hot-button issues by using sparkers that look for specific interests. In the set of studies by OkCupid I discussed earlier, their data scientists found that bringing up specific interests in direct messages also proved to be the most effective. Generic is boring. The more specific you can be, the more likely you are to find a hot button.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1293">The messages that were replied to the most contained words such as “metal,” “vegetarian,” and “zombie.” Why? One of these might be a hot button, but even if they aren’t, you at least have something to talk about.</p>

This is when you can ask for background stories, details, and dig deeper. That produces both great conversation and more dopamine, which makes you more memorable. Whether in person, over e-mail, or on the phone, looking for hot buttons is an easy way to spark interest.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-1311">Step #3: Wake People Up</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1312">You can also use conversational sparks and hot buttons to wake people up.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1313">In 1994, three researchers hired an actor to panhandle on the street asking for money. They ran three trials:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1314" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1315"><span class="strong">Trial 1:</span> Can you spare any change?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1316"><span class="strong">Trial 2:</span> Can you spare a quarter?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1317"><span class="strong">Trial 3:</span> Can you spare thirty-seven cents?</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1318">Can you guess which question did best? Yup, the third trial got the most people to say yes.</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1319" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1320"><span class="strong">Trial 1:</span> Can you spare any change? (44 percent of people complied)</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1321"><span class="strong">Trial 2:</span> Can you spare a quarter? (64 percent of people complied)</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1322"><span class="strong">Trial 3:</span> Can you spare 37 cents? <span class="strong">(75 percent of people complied)</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1323">The researchers found that slightly unusual or surprising requests pique the most interest.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-240" href="#calibre_link-73" class="calibre4 pcalibre">7</a></sup> It’s like coffee for the brain. Unique questions, unexpected stories, and uncommon occurrences keep us alert in conversation. <span class="strong">In other words, being different wakes people up.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1324">When you try to be the same as everyone else, it’s boring. When you try to fit into a mold, you become forgettable. When you try to be “normal,” you become dull. Just be yourself, because no one is like you. If you’re a little weird, own it. The right people will like you for it.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1325">This is not always easy. It’s hard to own being a little unique. Before I started using unique sparks in my conversations, I began experimenting with it on my website. For example, most websites ask you to “Click here!” or “Sign up here” or “Visit this link,” so I decided to try something unique. I put a button on my sidebar that says, “Do Not Click Here.”</p>
<div class="box1" id="calibre_link-1326">
<p class="center" id="calibre_link-1327"><span class="strong">DO NOT CLICK HERE</span></p>
</div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1328"><a id="calibre_link-1329" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>It is one of the most visited pages on my website simply because it says something different. By the way, I reward clickers of that button with a video of cute baby animals.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1330">Once I got a little more brave, I started to wonder if I could add conversational sparks to my elevator pitch to spice it up a little. My old pitch:</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1331">“I’m a writer.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1332">Boring! This is the equivalent of a panhandler asking for some change&mdash;you hear it, but it doesn’t really register. We have heard it before and we, sadly, pass right by. I decided to do my own version of the panhandling experiment. I came up with three versions of what I do and printed up business cards with a different e-mail address for each one.</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1333" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1334">I’m a writer.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1335">I write about people.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1336">I’m a professional people watcher.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1337">Over the next few weeks when someone would ask, “What do you do?” I would try out a version and then give them the corresponding card <em class="calibre6">if they asked for it.</em> I began to track not only which cards I passed out the most, but also which e-mails got the highest contact rate.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1338">I shouldn’t have been surprised to learn that “I’m a writer” did not get many card requests, nor did many people follow up with me after events; my “I’m a professional people watcher” elevator pitch got both laughs and card requests. I even began experimenting with putting unique images and content on my business card and found that those cards always got better feedback and won me more clients:</p>
<div class="landscape_default" id="calibre_link-1339"><img src="images/000037.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-364" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1340"><a id="calibre_link-1341" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Since conversational sparks were working for my pitches, I wondered if they might also work for others. One of my favorite TV shows is ABC’s <em class="calibre6">Shark Tank</em>. In this show, entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas to a panel of investors called sharks. I wanted to know if there were pitch patterns. So we decided to run a massive <em class="calibre6">Shark Tank</em> experiment.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1342">As of January 2016, 495 entrepreneurs have pitched on <em class="calibre6">Shark Tank</em>&mdash;253 got deals and 242 did not. What’s the difference? We analyzed each and every one of the 495 pitches and found distinct differences between the successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurs. One that immediately caught our attention was that standout entrepreneurs used conversational sparks and hot buttons in their pitches. <span class="strong">Entrepreneurs who added a unique request, tried something a little different, or added interactivity to their pitch had a much higher likelihood of getting a deal.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1343">The majority of successful entrepreneurs&mdash;63 percent&mdash;used a unique pitch method to get a deal. Some entrepreneurs brought on mascots like the one for Mr. Tod’s Pie Factory. Others brought on celebrities like Vincent Pastore from <em class="calibre6">The Sopranos</em> for Brocolli Wad. And the Kisstixx pitchers even made sharks Kevin O’Leary and Barbara Corcoran kiss to try out their lip balm.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1344">This is a way that entrepreneurs created sparks or high points in their pitches. Sharks hear dozens of pitches every episode, so when an entrepreneur tries something unique, it sparks dopamine for the investors and wakes them up.<a id="calibre_link-415" class="footnote_link pcalibre" type="noteref" href="#calibre_link-74">fn3</a></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1345">Conversational sparks add fuel to any interaction. I love to use the element of surprise to pique people’s interest. I frequently hand out lollipops with my business cards that say, “Learn how not to suck.”</p>
<div class="portrait_default" id="calibre_link-1346"><img src="images/000038.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-1347" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1348"><a id="calibre_link-1349" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>When people visit my office, I offer them hot cocoa instead of coffee. At trade shows, I have a bowl of Pop Rocks at my table instead of mints. In my guest bathroom at home, we have an R2D2 Pez dispenser and a gift book welcoming snoopers to our medicine cabinet. I send people air plants instead of flowers. I hide Easter eggs on my website (these are hidden links that once clicked deliver people to a video of me telling a corny joke).</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1350">Think about how you can energize different areas of your life. This creates tons of dopamine-worthy moments for the people you encounter. Again, this takes a little bravery, but can supercharge your conversations, pitches, meetings, parties, and social media with a little bit of uniqueness. Here are some more ways you can add conversational sparks to your interactions:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1351" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1352"><span class="strong">Spice up your job title.</span> Quicken Loans has a “vice president of miscellaneous stuff” who helps with a little bit of everything. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt calls its receptionists “directors of first impressions” since they are typically the company’s greeters.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1353"><span class="strong">Stop posting food pictures and sunsets on Instagram.</span> Post something people haven’t seen before. New mom and photographer Laura Izumikawa started posting (frickin’ adorable) pictures of her sleeping newborn baby dressed like different celebrities and characters like Jon Snow, Pikachu, and Beyoncé. As of writing she has over 400,000 followers and her account has been featured on the <em class="calibre6">Huffington Post</em>, Buzzfeed, and <em class="calibre6">Inside Edition</em>.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1354"><span class="strong">Put a unique quote in your e-mail signature.</span> Noah Kagan, creator of an e-mail and analytics software, has a funny sign-off on all of his e-mails: “Ps. Y u NO install the free <a href="http://SumoMe.com" class="pcalibre calibre5">SumoMe.com</a> to get more e-mail subscribers?” The purposeful misspellings and play on a popular meme makes his ask unique and very clickable.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1355"><span class="strong">Don’t serve coffee to clients; serve vanilla tea, lemonade, or cake pops.</span> When I checked into San Diego’s famous L’Auberge Del Mar hotel, I was given a room key and a s’mores cupcake&mdash;talk about a welcome gift! My elevator ride and first few hotel moments were sweet bliss.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1356"><span class="strong">Stop bringing casserole to potlucks. Whip up a recipe no one has tried before.</span> Pinterest is a never-ending source of inspiration for rainbow cupcakes, Rice Krispies ice cream, and pickle potato chips.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1357"><span class="strong"><a id="calibre_link-1358" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Instead of sending thank-you cards, send thank-you stickers&mdash;or pins, or lollipops, or popcorn.</span> At the Be Sage wedding conference, they gave attendees coloring books and pencils to use during sessions and on the plane ride home.

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1359">Don’t be afraid to try out a new joke, tell a silly story, or ask a nontypical conversation sparker. You’ll spice up your night, add flair to theirs, and have conversations you will never forget.</p>

</blockquote>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-1363">Bonus: Say My Name</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1364">You’ve probably heard that it’s charming to lightly drop someone’s name in conversation. You, me, everyone else: We love the sound of our own names.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1365">Dennis Carmody and Michael Lewis found that compared to other people’s names, upon hearing our own name we have greater brain activation in the middle frontal and superior temporal cortex&mdash;also where the amygdala and hippocampus are located.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-241" href="#calibre_link-75" class="calibre4 pcalibre">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1366">This was one of the reasons why Jeffer hits it off so well with his tour groups right away. He makes a point of quickly memorizing every single person’s name on the tour.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1367">Not good with names? Not anymore. Here is my three-step Name Game that you can do every time you meet someone new:</p>
<ol id="calibre_link-1368" class="calibre9">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1369" value="1"><span class="strong">Meet and Repeat:</span> As soon as you hear the name, say it out loud back to them. “It’s so nice to meet you, Eliza!” or “Eliza, this is my colleague Jenna.” This jangles the audio part of your memory and allows you to hear the name in your own voice. Plus, you give them a nice hit of dopamine.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1370" value="2"><span class="strong">Spell It Out:</span> Now we want to give that name a visual hook. Memory expert Dr. Gary Small encourages people to mentally <a id="calibre_link-1371" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>spell out the name they are trying to remember.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-242" href="#calibre_link-76" class="calibre4 pcalibre">9</a></sup> You can also pull up a picture of the name in your head.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1372" value="3"><span class="strong">Associate and Anchor:</span> Lastly, tie the name to someone else you know with that same name. It can even be a celebrity. This anchors the name to someone else you are familiar with. For example, whenever I meet a Matt, I always seat him at a poker table with all of my other Matt friends.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1373" value="4"><span class="strong">Bonus:</span> If it is a unique name or a name you have not heard before, tie it to a word that most closely resembles it. For example, I met a Syder (pronounced very similar to “cider”) so I pulled up a mental picture of a steaming glass of cider. He was shocked when I remembered his name at the end of the night.</li>
</ol>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1374">This exercise takes a bit of practice, but is a fun way to gamify names. I highly recommend teaching this Name Game to your friends or colleagues because you can help each other think of anchors when you meet people.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1375"><span class="strong">Insider Tip:</span> If you totally forget a name, set up a system with the people you are with. Anytime you introduce someone to them first, they should ask for the name. For example, if my husband says, “I would love to introduce you to my wife,” and does not mention the person’s name, it means he does not know it. Then I know to ask, “Lovely to meet you. What was your name?” Easy peasy.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-1376">A Safety Net</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1377">Worried you won’t be able to think of a snazzy conversation sparker when the moment comes?

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1387">If you want to have dazzling conversations, it’s up to you to create sparks. You can remember someone’s name, use conversation sparkers, or push hot buttons to create talking high points. Get out of your own conversational autopilot. Don’t use social scripts, ignite conversational sparks. Stop passively listening and push hot buttons. Hack conversations by creating talking high points. Be more memorable by really remembering the people you meet&mdash;from their names to their interests. Ending small talk starts big connections.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1395">We don’t like, remember, or enjoy being around boring people. The best way to hack into stimulating conversations and create memorable connections is to ignite conversational sparks. We are attracted to people who give us mental pleasure, who push our hot buttons, keep us mentally alert, and learn our names.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1407">My Vow of Silence lasted for seven days. No talking. No writing. No posting on social media. No responding to e-mail.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1408">That week was one of the hardest, most introspective, soul-wrenching times of my life. I almost lost my mind.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1409">The whole adventure started the day my kind, honest friend dropped an advice bomb. She gave me one of the toughest pieces of constructive feedback I have ever received: “You are an interrupter.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1410">Horrified, I tried to clarify, “What do you mean? Do you think I interrupt you when you speak?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1411">Gently, she explained, “Yes, and”&mdash;another truth grenade&mdash;“I’ve heard you do it to others, too.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1412">Boom! Shock. Embarrassment. And then a little self-exploration: I am terrified of awkward silences. I fear that moment when someone finishes a sentence and no one knows what to say next. To prevent these uncomfortable pauses, I got in the habit of interrupting. Worse, I began to preplan my responses while only half listening to the conversation. This is a terrible way to interact&mdash;it’s disrespectful, inauthentic, and exhausting for all parties.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1413">I realized that if I wanted to learn to be a better listener quickly, I should quit talking cold turkey. Enter: Vow of Silence. On August 10, 2014, I took a pledge and alerted all of my readers and colleagues that I would not be talking. I wanted to be in silence until the silence became less scary.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1414">There was one other hurdle. Even though I couldn’t talk, I still wanted to listen. So instead of hiding out in my house reading, I forced myself to <a id="calibre_link-1415" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>attend all of my usual meetings, networking events, and dinners like normal, but just listened. This way, I had to be present. I couldn’t think about witty comebacks, funny stories, or follow-ups. My number one goal was simply to listen with my entire brain. I didn’t even allow myself to write&mdash;then I still would have been dreaming up clever responses instead of listening. My only allowances were four premade flash cards that I could show to people I encountered. They said:</p>
<ol id="calibre_link-1416" class="calibre9">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1417" value="1">“I’ve taken a Vow of Silence. I’m trying to become a better listener.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1418" value="2">“Please tell me about yourself.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1419" value="3">“I’m sorry.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1420" value="4">“Thank you for allowing my silence.”</li>
</ol>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1421">The first day was the hardest. I walked into my first networking event as a sweaty, jittery mess. What if I freaked people out? What would I do in those horrible long pauses of silent disgust? Can you get kicked out of networking events for not networking?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1422">I completely panicked when a gentleman introduced himself. But I shakily held up my first card: “I’ve taken a Vow of Silence. I’m trying to become a better listener.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1423">To my delight and surprise, he laughed and told me how he had once lost his voice to laryngitis in college and it was one of the coolest and craziest experiences of his life. Then he spoke about meeting his wife a few weeks later. Then he shared his hope for his children. Then he asked for my card. I didn’t say a word. I didn’t have to. He just wanted to be listened to.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1424">As humans, we are desperate to be heard. The biggest thing I learned during my Vow of Silence is that <span class="strong">the best conversations aren’t about what you say, they are about what you hear</span>. I made better business connections during my <em class="calibre6">silent</em> week than during the fast-paced industry conference I went to the week before. One businesswoman even e-mailed me the day after my Vow of Silence and said:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-1425" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-1426">Hey Vanessa! I have been thinking so much about our conversation last night. I just joined your body language course and can’t wait to start it. I would love to take you out to coffee in the next few weeks if you are free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1427"><a id="calibre_link-1428" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>This e-mail boggled my mind! I hadn’t said a single word, but somehow our “conversation” was so memorable that it brought me business. Why?</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-1429">SILENCE SCIENCE</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1430">As much as we hate to admit it, we love to talk about ourselves. In fact, humans spend 30 to 40 percent of their verbal output solely dedicated to self-disclosure. This number balloons to 80 percent on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1431">Harvard neuroscientists Diana Tamir and Jason Mitchell found that something changes in our brain when we talk about ourselves. Activity increases in the brain regions that form the mesolimbic dopamine system. Keyword: dopamine.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-244" href="#calibre_link-79" class="calibre4 pcalibre">1</a></sup> <span class="strong">Talking about ourselves gives us pleasure.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1432">In one experiment, participants were even willing to forgo money to disclose more information about themselves. Yup&mdash;people will pay for the privilege to express their opinions.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1433">This is the science behind the famous Dale Carnegie phrase “To be interesting, be interested”<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-245" href="#calibre_link-80" class="calibre4 pcalibre">2</a></sup> and why my Vow of Silence worked so well. When you are interested, when you listen, when you let people talk, they feel pleasure.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1434">Before my Vow of Silence, my mind was always spinning trying to think of what I was going to say next. I couldn’t really process what people were saying because I was too busy trying to think of witty jokes, dazzling stories, and clever responses. This was a terrible way to interact. I was both distracted and turning people off by my distractedness. Then, to my great surprise, my silence won me more friends than my overeagerness ever had. Does this mean we should all go around being silent during our interactions? Definitely no. Being interested is only the first piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1435">Step One: When you ask dopamine-worthy conversation sparkers and listen to people’s responses, pleasure is produced. Success! BUT it’s what you do next that counts.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1436">Step Two: How do you honor what they say? What are you listening for? How do you respond to their self-disclosure? A great interaction is not one-sided.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1437">Here’s the thing: Being quiet didn’t just help me learn how to avoid interrupting, it also taught me a new way of listening.</p>

<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-1442">SILENT SLOAN</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1443">When Alfred P. Sloan took the reins as vice president of operations at General Motors, the company was struggling. In 1920, General Motors accounted for only a 12 percent share of car sales in the country. Sloan dreamed bigger. He decided the best way to tackle his industry competitors&mdash;namely the Ford motorcar&mdash;would be to go directly to his dealers to improve sales. Sloan began to visit each and every dealership personally and listen to the salesmen’s ideas. Sloan’s unique style was unheard of at this time&mdash;borderline heretical. As reported by the <em class="calibre6">New York Times:</em></p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-1444" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-1445">“It may surprise you to know,” he said at the time, “that I have personally visited, with many of my associates, practically every city in the United States, from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from Canada to Mexico. On these trips I visit from 5 to 10 dealers a day. I meet them in their own places of business, talk with them across their own desks and solicit from them suggestions and criticisms as to their relations with the corporation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1446">When meeting with dealers, Sloan didn’t try to win them over or convince them of his ideas. He once said, “I prefer to appeal to the intelligence of a man rather than attempt to exercise authority over him.” He was nicknamed Silent Sloan because “When he listened, it was with the extra intentness of the deaf.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1447">Sloan remained at the helm of General Motors until 1956. During his tenure, he spearheaded major advances in automotive technology including four-wheel brakes, ethyl gasoline, crankcase ventilation, and knee-action front springs. By the time he left in 1956, General Motors was one of the world’s most successful companies and had claimed over 52 percent of market share (a big leap from the 12 percent when Sloan first started).<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-246" href="#calibre_link-81" class="calibre4 pcalibre">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1448">Personal friend of Sloan and leading business author Peter F. Drucker credits Sloan’s success not to a fearless vision or to ruthless tactics but to <a id="calibre_link-1449" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>a listening-driven management style. How did Sloan hack the art of listening? Here’s how he worked:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1450" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1451">Sloan spent six days a week in meetings, three with formal agendas and three to address problems as they arose.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1452">Other than stating each meeting’s initial purpose, Sloan attended each meeting in silence. He almost never took notes or spoke except to clarify something with a question. According to Drucker, he ended each meeting with a brief pointed summary and thanks.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1453">Following each meeting, Sloan would pick one executive to be accountable and composed a short memo with a summary of what was said, next steps, work assignments, and a specific deadline. A copy of the memo was sent to everyone in the meeting.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-247" href="#calibre_link-82" class="calibre4 pcalibre">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1454">Sloan overturned conventional wisdom on what effective leadership looked like. In 1931, MIT created the first university program for executives called Sloan Fellows. And then the MIT Sloan School of Management was founded in 1950.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1455">For three decades, Silent Sloan <span class="strong">led with what he heard, not with what he said.</span> He listened with intent and then followed up with action. I call this hack being a highlighter.</p>

<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-1459">SKILL #1: BE A HIGHLIGHTER</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1460">I have a moderate obsession with office supplies. Nothing gets me going like a fresh pack of snazzy pens, a bunch of little notebooks, and a colorful array of sticky tabs. I remember inheriting my first bright yellow highlighter from my older brother&mdash;and by inherited, I do mean stolen from his backpack.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1461">It was such a game changer! That little stick of brightness helped me learn faster, remember more and emphasize important points. The best communicators do the exact same thing&mdash;they serve as conversational <a id="calibre_link-1462" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>highlighters. They listen to learn more about a person, to remember what was said and then find the important points to act upon.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1463">So far, you’ve designed your Social Game Plan, leveraged the Triple Threat, and sparked conversation. Now what? It’s time to hack the art&mdash;and science&mdash;of listening. You can do this by being a highlighter:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-1464" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturecenter" id="calibre_link-1465"><span class="strong">HACK #4: Highlighter</span></p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturecenter" id="calibre_link-1466"><span class="strong">Bring out the best in people by highlighting their strengths.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1467">When you know what to listen for, you know exactly how to respond. Highlighting is also a way of practicing more refreshing and honest interactions. Highlighting is not about sugarcoating, it’s not about brownnosing, and it’s not about sucking up. It’s about honoring what you truly find noteworthy and getting real conversations started.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1468">Emily McDowell has made an entire business out of speaking truth by highlighting people.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-248" href="#calibre_link-83" class="calibre4 pcalibre">5</a></sup> And, it happened by accident. In 2012, Emily had an idea for a different kind of Valentine’s Day card. She wanted to help the people on Valentine’s Day who are dating but not officially in a relationship.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1469">So she printed up one hundred copies of this card at a local printer and put it up on Etsy in late January 2013. She called it “The Awkward Dating Card.”</p>
<div class="portrait_medium1" id="calibre_link-1470"><img src="images/000039.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-394" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1471"><a id="calibre_link-1472" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Talk about a conversation sparker! Her card’s raw honesty and humor took the Internet by storm. Three months later, she got an order from Urban Outfitters for 96,000 cards. Emily started creating more honest posters, pins, tote bags, and paper products that help highlight anyone who receives them.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1473">She has ridiculously candid birthday cards that say, “Thinking about you is like remembering I have ice cream in the freezer.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1474">You can get notepads that are “Everyday Achievement Awards” where friends or colleagues can fill in the blanks to highlight a recent task: “Is hereby issued to ______ for the modest yet mighty task of ______. We honor your victory.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1475">I was turned on to Emily’s amazing highlighting approach when someone handed me a card that said, “I notice how awesome you are.” It made my day! I then got myself a pack of her cards to hand out that say, “I love the shit out of you” and “You don’t suck.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1476">Emily’s cards are powerful because they give both compliments and truth. Anyone can be a Hallmark card&mdash;doling out bland flattery and boring cliches. But highlighting is about more than just giving regular praise. Like Emily McDowell’s cards, it is about truly expecting the best from people and helping everyone in your life perform, act, and show up as the best, most honest version of themselves.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-1477">The Pygmalion Effect</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1478">There is a famous Greek myth about the sculptor Pygmalion. According to legend, Pygmalion used a large piece of ivory to carve his vision of the ideal woman. His statue was so beautiful and realistic that he fell in love with it. Embarrassed and ashamed to admit his desires, Pygmalion made offerings to the love goddess Aphrodite. At her altar, he secretly prayed to meet a woman who would be “the living likeness of my ivory girl.”<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-249" href="#calibre_link-84" class="calibre4 pcalibre">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1479">When Pygmalion got back to his studio, he planted a soft kiss on the statue. To his surprise, he found the ivory lips warm. When he kissed her again, the statue came to life. Pygmalion then married the woman of his own creation.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1480">The Pygmalion myth is about the self-fulfilling power of expectation. Pygmalion created a blueprint of what he wanted and then it came to life. In other words, <span class="strong">great expectations are met with greatness.</span> Psychologists have found that this idea is no myth. This phenomenon is called the Pygmalion effect.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1481"><a id="calibre_link-1482" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>When voters are told they are more “politically active” than their peers (even if they were actually chosen at random), they have a 15 percent higher turnout rate than the control group.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-250" href="#calibre_link-85" class="calibre4 pcalibre">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1483">When donors are told that they are above-average givers (even if they are not), they in turn donate more to become above-average givers.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-251" href="#calibre_link-86" class="calibre4 pcalibre">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1484">When hotel maids are told that they have a high-intensity, calorie-burning job, they in turn then burn more calories.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-252" href="#calibre_link-87" class="calibre4 pcalibre">9</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1485">When a computer gives automated compliments to students, those students perform better on tasks&mdash;even when students know those compliments are automated.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-253" href="#calibre_link-88" class="calibre4 pcalibre">10</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-1486">Positive Labels</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1487">Humans love to be given positive labels. They improve our self-image and gently push us to be better versions of ourselves. So as you use conversation sparkers and see what unexpected directions they lead you in, allow yourself to be impressed by the person across from you. Listen for their eloquent ideas. Find ways to emphasize their strengths. Celebrate their excitement.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1488">Take the rather silly example of the Sorting Hat in the Harry Potter series. At the beginning of each school year, Hogwarts students are sorted into different houses by a magical hat that reads their minds, taking full measure of their hidden skills. Each house is known for different strengths, and as they move to the higher grades, students’ defining characteristics become more and more pronounced. Students in Slytherin tend to be sly, savvy, and interested in the dark arts, whereas those in Hufflepuff often end up in caretaking magical jobs like herbology and care of magical creatures. For better or for worse, the more clear the labels we’re given, the more we embody them.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1489">Here are some examples you could use:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1490" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1491">“You know everyone&mdash;you must be a great networker!”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1492">“I’m amazed by your dedication to this organization&mdash;they are lucky to have you.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1493">“You are so knowledgeable in this subject&mdash;thank goodness you are here.”</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-1494">Exponential Excitement</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1495">Another way of highlighting is to celebrate the victories of others as if they were your own. Good feelings multiply around other good <a id="calibre_link-1496" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>feelings&mdash;and divide when they are not matched. When you see someone who is proud, excited, or passionate&mdash;mirror and match it. This associates you with their feelings of pleasure.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1497">You can say something simple:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1498" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1499">“I am so thrilled for you!”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1500">“How wonderful that must be!”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1501">“That is just the best news, congrats!”</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1502">When I see something&mdash;anything, that’s awesome, I always take the opportunity to highlight. I tell my barista his latte art is gorgeous. I gush over my friends’ new haircuts. I send out postcards telling people they’re ballers. Yes, really:</p>

<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumheadnts" id="calibre_link-1504">SKILL #2: BE A RAVER</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1505">Want to know one of the biggest missed opportunities in social situations? Introductions. I get some version of this e-mail multiple times per week:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-1506" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-1507">Hey Vanessa&mdash;I wanted to intro you to Dave. Dave, here is that intro you were asking for. Hope you two connect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1508">Boring! I have no idea who he is or why I should know him. The same thing happens at networking events, client meetings, and conferences. I <a id="calibre_link-1509" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>am almost always introduced to someone in the most boring, generic way possible:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-1510" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-1511">Vanessa, meet John; John, meet Vanessa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1512"><span class="strong">This is a waste of an opportunity!</span> Seize introductions as the perfect way to highlight people. Even if you have only known them for a few minutes, you can find something to rave about.</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1513" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1514">“Vanessa, meet Dave. He is killing it in the software industry and just had a hugely successful launch.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1515">“Joe, meet Sue. She is an incredible painter and one of the most talented artists I know.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1516">“Kirk, let me introduce you to Annie. We just met and she is telling me the most fascinating story of her trip to South Africa.”</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1517">You can even do this when you’re the one introducing yourself:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1518" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1519">“It’s so nice to meet you! I have heard that you have an incredible blog. Please tell me all about how you got all of your success.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1520">“Great to know you, a friend of John is a friend of mine. He always knows the most interesting people.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1521">“It’s a pleasure! Your name tag says you work at Ken’s Bakery&mdash;they are my favorite pizza in town! Have you always been a pizza aficionado?”</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1522">Why are raving introductions so powerful? First, you give people positive labels right at the start. Second, you tee up a great conversation and possible discussion topics for the people involved. Third, you get people talking about themselves&mdash;what they do and who they are, which produces dopamine. Yes, a raving introduction is ALSO a conversational spark. Boom: win-win-win.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-1523">SKILL #3: DON’T BE A GOLEM</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1524">Do you know what the opposite of the Pygmalion effect is? The golem effect.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-254" href="#calibre_link-89" class="calibre4 pcalibre">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1525">The golem effect is when low expectations lead to poor performance. Major Wilburn Schrank<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-255" href="#calibre_link-90" class="calibre4 pcalibre">12</a></sup> decided to test the golem effect on incoming <a id="calibre_link-1526" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>United States Air Force Academy freshmen. Schrank randomly assigned labels to a group of one hundred enlisted airmen at the United States Air Force Academy Preparatory School. They were given one of five different made-up “ability levels.” The US military is all about labels, rank, and position, so Schrank wanted to know if these labels have any effect on academic performance. Sure enough, for all of the data sets, the airmen who received the worst labels also performed the worst.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1527">The golem effect can have devastating consequences across the board. Dr. Brian McNatt found that the golem effect is especially prevalent in the workplace.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-256" href="#calibre_link-91" class="calibre4 pcalibre">13</a></sup> Think of bosses who pick favorites. Here’s what happens:</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1528">Jeff is the boss. He hires a new sales associate from his alma mater, XYZ University. He takes her under his wing, they grab lunch more often, he gives her the best assignments. After all, Jeff thinks anyone from his alma mater has the best possible education, and he wants his fellow alumni to succeed. She benefits from the Pygmalion effect. Jeff expects the best from her and she performs at her best. Other employees see this favoritism and feel left out. One particular manager, Ken, went to ABC University, XYZ’s rival. Jeff is constantly ribbing Ken&mdash;jokingly, of course. Ken doesn’t get invited to watch games at the boss’s house on weekends. Jeff teases Ken for not being able to get into XYZ&mdash;Ken knows he’s kidding, but feels the sting anyway.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1529"><span class="strong">Hallway chitchat and watercooler conversations matter.</span> Expecting the best is not just important for new people, but also to build up the existing people in your life. What are you saying about and to your colleagues?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1530">Being a highlighter is about constantly searching for the good in people. When you tell people they are good, they become better. When you search for what’s good, you feel great.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-1531">BONUS: HELP PEOPLE IMPRESS YOU</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1532">Have you ever wanted to impress people with your knowledge? Your experience? Your success? I think highlighting is actually the key to impressing people.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1533">My friend Thursday Bram is an amazing highlighter. She runs a club called PyLadies. This is a group of female coders who use the Python programming language. They meet multiple times a week to socialize, brainstorm, and help on coding projects. When Thursday and her fellow <a id="calibre_link-1534" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>founders got the idea for the group, it was important for them to create a thriving, supportive group of women.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1535">Thursday got the idea to bring gold star stickers. You know the kind teachers gave us when we were little? Everyone, no matter how old, loves getting a gold star. So at meetings and during events, Thursday passes out gold stars to ladies who contribute an idea, help fix a problem, or are just all-around awesome. Not surprisingly, people love it. And as more and more PyLadies receive gold stars, they act in more and more gold-star-worthy ways. The cycle creates an upward spiral of behavior.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1536">You don’t actually have to carry around gold star stickers to highlight people&mdash;although it would be a fun experiment to try! Instead, highlighting is about giving people emotional gold stars by assigning positive labels, capitalizing on their excitement, and calling out their good deeds.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1537">Being memorable is not about bringing up your high points. It’s about highlighting theirs. <span class="strong">Don’t try to impress people, let them impress you.</span></p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-1538">HACKING LISTENING</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1539">I have made my Vow of Silence an annual tradition. It reminds me to pause, stop interrupting, and listen intently. Now, hundreds of my readers join me on these quiet adventures with the hashtag #vowofsilence. We quit social media, turn off e-mail, and just practice listening.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1540">Every time, I am astounded by how many people yell at me during my vow&mdash;as if my not speaking somehow also turns off my hearing. Each time, I am shocked when people attempt to use elaborate hand gestures and dramatic dance as they talk to me&mdash;quiet is not deaf. Most importantly, after each vow, I am reminded that while listening is an amazing tool to get people to open up, it’s only the first step. Real connection comes from interaction.<a id="calibre_link-418" class="footnote_link pcalibre" type="noteref" href="#calibre_link-92">fn1</a></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1541">I once had dinner with a former fashion model. Genevieve is stunning&mdash;shiny auburn hair, milky skin, and superlong legs. During our meal, she was demure, pleasant, and attentive, but barely spoke. When asked a question she would smile, answer quickly, and take a sip of wine. I didn’t think much of the experience and probably wouldn’t have remembered it all until something interesting happened a few weeks later.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1542"><a id="calibre_link-1543" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>I was at a party, talking to a few friends, when Genevieve sauntered up. I turned and introduced her&mdash;trying as best as I could to rave. Even though we had spent an evening together, I didn’t have much to go on. So, I kept it simple: “Everyone, meet the lovely Genevieve. We had dinner at that amazing new Italian restaurant on Twenty-third last month.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1544">She shook hands with the group, stayed for a few minutes, and then asked if I wanted to grab another glass of champagne with her. As we walked away, she huffed in exasperation. “Ugh!” she exclaimed. “I have met your friend Chris at least a dozen times. Every time I see him he doesn’t remember me. What’s his problem?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1545">This didn’t surprise me in the least. Here’s the hard truth: It wasn’t Chris’s fault, it was hers. Genevieve doesn’t give people a reason to remember her. <span class="strong">Being an amazing listener is not just about what you hear, it’s how you respond to what you hear.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1546">In every conversation, every interaction, every meeting we have, we want to give people a reason to remember us. Genevieve has supermodel looks and a very pleasant demeanor. But that’s not enough! I can’t help but compare my experience with Genevieve to a daily interaction I have with the parking lot attendant at my gym.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1547">George directs the traffic in the insanely small parking lot at my local gym. Despite people grumbling at him all day, he always greets everyone happily and asks them the same question: “Want to know the daily fun fact?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1548">The first time he asked me this, I was lost in my own thoughts charging across the lot. It stopped me dead in my tracks. “Daily fun fact?” I was delighted, dopamine pumping in promise of a mental reward. “Of course I want to know the daily fun fact!”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1549">Then he recited his fun fact of the day&mdash;which is always something titillating or laugh-worthy like “Did you know Scotland’s national animal is the unicorn?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1550">Or “You can see an owl’s eyeball when you look in its ear.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1551">Or, the one from today, “Russia has a larger surface area than Pluto.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1552">Here’s the best part. Do you know where he gets his fun facts? Us! After he delivers his fact of the day, he asks each person, “Do you have a fun fact for me?” And he waits and listens as people tell him all kinds of obscure tidbits&mdash;some real facts and some just fun facts about all aspects of life&mdash;talk about using Hack #3: Conversational Sparks.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1553">Inevitably, they end up laughing (and checking Google for verification <a id="calibre_link-1554" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>on most). Secretly, I hoard fun facts for him and always hope he will pick mine the next day.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1555">I used to pull into that lot stressed and miserable trying to squeeze into a parking space. Now, I look for George.</p>

<h2 class="eb04mainheadclosedtitlenbs" id="calibre_link-1571">Intrigue</h2>
<h3 class="eb04mainheadclosedtitle" id="calibre_link-1572">How to be ridiculously likable</h3>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1573">In 2007, Lewis Howes was at the top of his game. As a six-foot-four wide receiver for the Arena Football League and an All-American decathlete, Howes was poised to go all the way to the NFL.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1574">Then he snapped his wrist on a diving catch, and his dream of professional football was over in a matter of seconds. “It wasn’t pretty. I was 24 years old, washed up, broke, and sleeping on my sister’s couch with my arm in a cast and a mountain of credit card debt staring me in the face,” said Howes.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-258" href="#calibre_link-94" class="calibre4 pcalibre">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1575">Howes had to start a new career track from scratch and accidentally discovered a powerful way to connect with people. In 2008, LinkedIn was a small social media website for business professionals, but Howes saw an opportunity to stay in touch with people in athletics&mdash;even though he could no longer play, he still had a passion for sports.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1576">He began to construct his contact list from scratch. Next, he started testing what kind of messages worked best on cold contacts. “It was easy to track which messages were working and which were not based on the replies in my LinkedIn inbox,” explained Howes.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-259" href="#calibre_link-95" class="calibre4 pcalibre">2</a></sup> He found that his most successful messages mentioned at least three commonalities he had with the person.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1577">“I would try to find at least three things we shared&mdash;usually a mutual connection, a mutual interest, and a mutual organization, like a school, league, or sports team,” said Howes. These messages were short and to the point. Howes composed a sample for me using this method:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-1578" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-1579"><a id="calibre_link-1580" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Hi Vanessa! My name is Lewis and I wanted to reach out because I saw you’re also friends with Nick Onken, we do work with Pencils of Promise together. I’m based in LA and saw you’re from here. Do you ever get back in town? Would love to connect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1581">Howes crafted a strategy for his follow-up messages, too. “I told them I loved their work and wanted to learn from them. I was direct and said, ‘My goal is to learn about you and your success,’ ” said Howes. He ended every interaction with a specific question they could answer.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1582">Amazingly, this approach landed Howes phone calls, one-on-one meetings, and mentorships with some of the most powerful people in sports over and over again. One of his most impressive cold messages landed him a meeting with the cofounder of ESPN, Bill Rasmussen. “I was this kid with no job and no money, but I reached out to Bill and was able to get a sit-down meeting and interview him,” recalled Howes.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1583">After the first year of reaching out to important people and learning from them, Howes hit a turning point. He realized what he was doing wasn’t enough. “At this point, I understood that I couldn’t just take, I had to give. But how do you give to someone like Bill Rasmussen?” explained Howes.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1584">As his contact list grew, Howes realized he finally had something to offer his connections&mdash;his own network. “I enjoyed helping people and relished becoming what Malcolm Gladwell calls a ‘connector,’ ” said Howes.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-260" href="#calibre_link-96" class="calibre4 pcalibre">3</a></sup> He asked his VIPs who they wanted to meet and then worked to get them that connection.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1585">“I would ask people, ‘What’s your biggest challenge right now?’ and then would connect them with at least three people who I thought could help. I would literally take out my phone over our cups of coffee, make the call, and hand the person my phone,” said Howes.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1586">Howes also applied the Triple Threat to all of his interactions without even realizing it&mdash;and it worked like a charm. “I show people I’m listening to them and only them. I make eye contact, take them in, and pay attention to nothing else,” said Howes.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1587">By January 2010, his company had over $5 million in sales. Eventually, he sold his business for seven figures. Now, Howes runs a successful lifestyle blog and podcast called <em class="calibre6">The School of Greatness</em>, where he interviews VIPs, experts, and luminaries on a wide variety of subjects. He uses his <a id="calibre_link-1588" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>connection skills to find the most interesting, remarkable, and fascinating people to interview&mdash;I should know, I was one of them! (Insert self-deprecating laugh here.) Yes, he did use the exact template above to reach out to me to be on his podcast.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1589">This chapter is about the powerful human behavior principle that makes Howes so socially attractive.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-1590">THE SIMILARITY-ATTRACTION EFFECT</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1591">One night I was having dinner with a few friends when someone pulled a Pilot G-2 pen out of her purse to take some notes. My friend Tyler spotted it instantly and asked, “Does your G-2 pen have a point-seven-millimeter tip?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1592">She didn’t even have to look. “Well, of course it does. Point-seven-millimeter tips are the only sensible choice for Pilot G-2s.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1593">Tyler smiled knowingly. “We are going to be friends,” he said simply.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1594">Now, I am no pen expert, but according to Tyler, the Pilot G-2 .7mm pen is simply the best. So good, in fact, that Tyler not only fiercely guards his against borrowing thieves, but also uses it as a sign. “If someone has a G-2 pen, I know we are going to get along,” Tyler explains.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1595">What’s going on here? As humans, we are constantly on the lookout for people who are similar to us. “Birds of a feather flock together” is a far more accurate cliché than “opposites attract.” This is called the <span class="strong">similarity-attraction effect.</span> It says that “people like and are attracted to others who are similar, rather than dissimilar, to themselves.”<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-261" href="#calibre_link-97" class="calibre4 pcalibre">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1596">Researchers Dr. Ellen Berscheid and Dr. Elaine Walster believe we enjoy spending time with people who are similar to us for combinations of the following reasons:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1597" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1598">It is easier to get along with someone who enjoys the same activities and conversation topics. Spouses and friends are more likely to have similar personality types than randomly assigned pairs.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1599">When someone agrees with us, it makes us feel less alone and more right in our own opinions.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1600">If we can relate to someone strongly, we might be able to better predict their behavior and future decisions, making us feel more in control.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1601"><a id="calibre_link-1602" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>We hope that if someone is similar to us, then there is a greater likelihood they will be attracted to us&mdash;like begets like.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-262" href="#calibre_link-98" class="calibre4 pcalibre">5</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1603">A “like” on Facebook or a “heart” on Instagram or a “retweet” on Twitter are all digital forms of the similarity-attraction effect in action. When you give someone some link love, you are telling them, “I like this, too!” That is why we are so addicted to checking our social media&mdash;we like to know that our friends and followers both like us and are like us.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1604">Without realizing it, we are <span class="strong">constantly searching for reasons to think, feel, or say, “Me too!”</span> In a good meeting or great coffee date, you hear phrases like this:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1605" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1606">Wow&mdash;you like <em class="calibre6">Orange Is the New Black</em>? I’m an addict!</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1607">You’re gluten free? Join the club!</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1608">Oh, I love Thailand! Maybe we were there at the same time?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1609">Are you kidding? I’m a huge 49ers fan.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1610">You’re into rock climbing? Me too!</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1611">On the other hand, one of the biggest mistakes I see people make is inadvertently pointing out differences while trying to connect. <span class="strong">Whenever you say a version of “Not me!” you are handicapping your connection from the start.</span> “Not me!” phrases sound like this:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1612" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1613">You know, I never really got into <em class="calibre6">Orange Is the New Black</em>. I thought it was kinda boring.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1614">You’re one of those gluten-free people? Don’t you think that’s a fad?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1615">I’m not a big traveler.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1616">Sports? No, thank you! I would rather read a book or watch the news.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1617">You’re into rock climbing? Not me! I’m afraid of heights.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1618">These kinds of “Not me!” comments tend to push people away and shut down a conversation. Does this mean you constantly have to blindly agree with people you meet? No, of course not! But it does mean you have to put effort into searching for real similarities and shared interests.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1619">When someone posts something on social media that isn’t relevant to <a id="calibre_link-1620" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>you, you just keep scrolling. You don’t share the post with a huffy comment like “This isn’t relevant to me!” But we sometimes imply as much in our responses. So if someone mentions they went to private school growing up, don’t say, “Ugh! I hated those preppy kids. I went to good old public school.” Instead, note it and resume looking for something you do have in common. (You might say, “Interesting! Did you play any sports?” or “Wow, I didn’t know that, tell me more!”)</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1621"><span class="strong">Don’t fall into the “Not me!” trap; instead, find a way to say “Me too!”</span></p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-1622">SEARCHING FOR “ME TOO”</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1623">My friend Allon Freiman sells raffle tickets at sporting events for charity. He messaged me with an interesting question:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-1624" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelastbs" id="calibre_link-1625">Hey Vanessa! I was wondering if you could use your human behavior knowledge to help me out with something I have been wondering. When I sell raffle tickets at games I often dress in a suit to be more professional. But recently I have been thinking that I should dress in team colors&mdash;maybe my tie or something? Let me know if there is any science to this or if you think it is a good idea.</p>
<p class="eb21extrafeatureindentednbs" id="calibre_link-1626"> Best, Allon</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1627">Allon’s intuition was absolutely right. We like people who look like us. One study found that we are more likely to help people who are dressed like us.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-263" href="#calibre_link-99" class="calibre4 pcalibre">6</a></sup> Someone dressed casually is more likely to help someone else who is also dressed casually over someone in a business suit. This is counterintuitive&mdash;one would think that someone in a business suit would be helped more often, period. Not so.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1628">I advised Allon to not only wear the team’s colors but also to dress exactly like the fans he was trying to sell to&mdash;jeans, jersey, sneakers, hat and all. Guess what? He immediately began to sell more raffle tickets. This is the similarity-attraction effect in action.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1629">We don’t just have a soft spot for people who <em class="calibre6">look</em> like us, we are also drawn to people who <em class="calibre6">think</em> like us. There is an admittedly terrible (and addictive) MTV show that I watch “for work” to “observe human behavior.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1630"><em class="calibre6">Are You the One?</em> is a reality show where ten men and ten women are <a id="calibre_link-1631" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>brought into a house to find their soul mate. But, of course, there’s a catch. Each of the contestants has taken a battery of personality tests with “love experts” who have picked one ideal mate for them. Their goal is to find their ideal match from the batch of singles.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1632">In season three, two of the singles, Connor Smith and Kayla Brackett, try to get a feel for their compatibility. Here’s how that conversation goes (note the constant searching for similarity):</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-1633" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1634"><small class="calibre14">KAYLA:</small> I want someone who is close to their family.</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1635"><small class="calibre14">CONNOR:</small> I’m a total mama’s boy. But can you keep someone’s attention?</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1636"><small class="calibre14">KAYLA:</small> Are you kidding me, that is all me. I whip my man into shape. That’s my thing.</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1637"><small class="calibre14">CONNOR:</small> Huh, that’s what I ask for!</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1638"><small class="calibre14">KAYLA:</small> I want someone who is big and strong, because I like to feel protected. (Note: Connor is over six foot five and calls himself the Gentle Giant.)</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1639"><small class="calibre14">CONNOR:</small> I always want to sleep on the side of the bed closest to the door.</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1640"><small class="calibre14">KAYLA:</small> Oh good, I like to be closer to the wall!</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1641"><small class="calibre14">SUMMARY:</small> You’re like me. I like what you like. I like you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1642">We engage in the exact same behavior as Connor and Kayla even in nonromantic situations. We do it with potential clients&mdash;aligning interests and work methods. We do it with new friends&mdash;comparing music taste and weekend activities. We even do it in line with strangers&mdash;commiserating over the long wait.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1643">You can hack the similarity-attraction effect for your benefit with what I call:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-1644" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturecenter" id="calibre_link-1645"><span class="strong">HACK #5: Thread Theory</span></p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturecenter" id="calibre_link-1646"><span class="strong">Find and follow threads of similarity to be more socially attractive.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1647">Every interaction should be about finding threads of commonalities. Every thread that binds you brings you closer to a person. The more threads you have, the more socially attractive you become. Here’s how you can use thread theory to connect with the people you meet instantly:</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-1648"><a id="calibre_link-1649" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Step #1: Search for Threads</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1650">Thread Theory is the ultimate tool for opening any conversation. Whether you are cold-calling, e-mailing a new contact, or meeting someone for the first time, the Thread Theory can help you blast through the dialogue door.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1651">Imagine that each person is walking around carrying a big knotted ball of string. All of these strings are their thoughts, ideas, and opinions. We often wish our thoughts were more organized, but they are usually in a jumble&mdash;especially when we first walk into an event. We might be thinking about our to-do list, our parking meter, what we want for dinner, that good-looking person across the room, our neck ache, where to hang our coat&mdash;you get the idea. So we are all walking around carrying this mass of thoughts.</p>
<div class="landscape_small" id="calibre_link-1652"><img src="images/000041.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-366" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1653">The Thread Theory is an incredibly easy way to both open conversations and never run out of things to say. When you first begin in an interaction, I want you to try to tease out some thoughts you both share. The more threads you share, the more you will be able to talk about&mdash;and the more ridiculously likable you will be.</p>
<div class="landscape_small" id="calibre_link-1654"><img src="images/000042.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-1655" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1656">There are three main categories of commonalities that you can pull from at any time:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1657" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1658"><span class="strong">People:</span> Mutual contacts are the best way to find threads of similarity. You can also liven up the conversation by searching for mutual friends.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1659"><span class="strong"><a id="calibre_link-1660" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Context:</span> Think you don’t have anything in common? Think about the context of your meeting. Maybe you’re both on LinkedIn or both at the same conference. All you have to do is ask about it to get the conversational ball rolling.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1661"><span class="strong">Interests:</span> Common interests are the best kind of threads because they introduce a topic you both invariably know a lot about, ripe territory for great stories and interesting conversation.</li>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1705">These Thread Theory questions can be used in groups, with new people and even in e-mails and cold messages. Every time you discover a common thread, it links you together:</p>
<div class="landscape_small" id="calibre_link-1706"><img src="images/000043.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-367" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1707"><a id="calibre_link-1708" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>You might have noticed that some of these Thread Theory questions are also my favorite conversation sparkers&mdash;that’s no coincidence! Simple questions can lead you into exciting conversational territory when you ask strategically and follow up with good listening.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1709">If you ask one of these questions and don’t find a similarity, it’s totally okay. For example, if someone says, “Oh, I don’t know her,” or “Nope, never been here before.” No worries! Use that as an opener. You can say, “Yeah, it is a pretty big school. I think she studied political science. What did you study?” or “Me neither! Do you have any favorite local watering holes you go to?” Every answer you hear is one more step in getting to know them and being further along in conversation. <span class="strong">Don’t let it faze you, let it fuel you</span>.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1710">Be on the lookout for physical examples of similarities, too. For example, if you notice someone’s USC keychain you can say, “Go Trojans!” Or if someone is driving a car you like, you can comment, “I was thinking about buying that car, how do you like it?” It can even be as simple as noticing what someone is drinking: “The red wine isn’t bad, huh?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1711">Making conversation has never been so easy.</p>

<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-1717"><a id="calibre_link-1718" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Step #2: Follow the Thread</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1719">The Thread Theory is not about simply pointing out similarities; it is about exploring them. Once you have found a common thread, you can make it stronger by following it.</p>
<div class="landscape_small" id="calibre_link-1720"><img src="images/000045.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-1721" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1722">How do you follow a common thread? Easy. Ask for why.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1723">Revolutionary Japanese inventor Sakichi Toyoda founded Toyota Motor Company in 1937. He is also known for his innovative managerial techniques, one of which is called the Five Whys.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1724">Toyota employees use the Five Whys to problem solve and get to the bottom of issues. This technique is now used across industries to quickly and effectively find solutions and root causes of problems. You might use the Five Whys to figure out why a colleague is late on a project:</p>
<ol id="calibre_link-1725" class="calibre9">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1726" value="1">Why? I couldn’t get the numbers on time.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1727" value="2">Why? I didn’t know the right person to talk to.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1728" value="3">Why? I have never worked with that department before.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1729" value="4">Why? I usually go through my manager.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1730" value="5">Why? Interdepartmental communications only go through managers, which causes a bottleneck. (Root cause)</li>
</ol>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1731">Of course, in day-to-day conversations you can’t ask why over and over again, but <span class="strong">you can get a conversation to go much deeper much faster if you use the spirit of the Five Whys.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1732">When you find a commonality, don’t let it pass by, ask the other person why it’s important to them. When you stumble upon a similarity, don’t jump to the next topic; take it a step further and find out how they got started. If you hear a shared interest, don’t let it hang without comment; dig a little deeper.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1733">Let’s say, through the Thread Theory, you find out the person you are <a id="calibre_link-1734" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>speaking with is also an entrepreneur. If you follow that thread, you get a much deeper interaction:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-1735" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1736"><small class="calibre14">YOU:</small> <span class="strong">Why</span> did you decide to become an entrepreneur?</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1737"><small class="calibre14">THEM:</small> I always wanted to start my own business.</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1738"><small class="calibre14">YOU:</small> Interesting! <span class="strong">Why</span> did that appeal to you?</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1739"><small class="calibre14">THEM:</small> I really wanted flexibility and freedom in work hours, and I knew I could never get that with a boss.</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1740"><small class="calibre14">YOU:</small> I feel the same way! <span class="strong">Why</span> were you looking for more flexibility?</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1741"><small class="calibre14">THEM:</small> Oh, I love to travel so I wanted to be able to work from anywhere.</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1742"><small class="calibre14">YOU:</small> That’s wonderful&mdash;I’m also a huge traveler, I just came back from Chile! <span class="strong">Why</span> do you love to travel?</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1743"><small class="calibre14">THEM:</small> I have been dying to go to Chile! You know, I think I love travel so much because I think it’s so important to get out of your comfort zone and learn from people around the world.</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1744"><small class="calibre14">YOU:</small> That’s so true! I have met the most interesting people on my travels. <span class="strong">Why</span> do you think being out of our comfort zone is so important?</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-1745"><small class="calibre14">THEM:</small> Hmmm, good question. I guess I think true happiness comes from trying new things, seeing new things, experiencing new things. How about you? Where do you think happiness comes from?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1746">This is a synthesized version of the kind of robust, deep conversations that come when you ask more whys. “Why” gets you beyond small talk into an exploration of motivations, dreams, and interests. And every why helps you find more threads.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1747"><span class="strong">In this way, the Thread Theory ensures you will never run out of things to talk about.</span> Nor will you ever have to be worried that you won’t have something to say. Just search for the commonality and follow the thread with why.</p>
<div class="boxnbs" id="calibre_link-1748">
<h5 class="box_title" id="calibre_link-1749"><span class="strong">FAST FACT BOX</span></h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1750">We had 1,049 participants tell us who they have the hardest time communicating with. As you can see, we all have someone we have a hard time communicating with and the results are all over the board! You can use the Thread Theory with anyone in your life to make communication easier. Who is your person? How can you find a tie with them?</p>
<div class="landscape_small" id="calibre_link-1751"><img src="images/000046.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-1752" class="calibre1" /></div>
</div>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-1753"><a id="calibre_link-1754" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Step #3: Create Ties</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1755">The last step of the Thread Theory is optional and reserved only for special interactions. When you are having a really great discussion and clicking with someone, you can take your connection to the next level by using your common threads to tie you together. Let’s look at how Lewis Howes did this.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1756">After he searched for commonalities and followed the threads he found, he asked people what they needed and how he could help. In other words, <span class="strong">he tied his abilities to their needs</span>. When you say, “You have a problem, I’m going to help you fix it,” you create the ultimate similarity.</p>
<div class="landscape_small" id="calibre_link-1757"><img src="images/000047.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-368" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1758"><span class="strong"><a id="calibre_link-1759" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Every time you offer help, support, and advice, you create a deeper bond with someone and a permanent similarity.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1760">Most of the time, opportunities to help people find solutions come up organically. You hear someone has a need and know you can help. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1761" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1762">Since you’re new in town, I can send you a list of my favorite local restaurants.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1763">I’m sure I know someone in that industry&mdash;connect with me on LinkedIn and I can introduce you.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1764">I frequently get extra tickets to the game; I’ll text you next time!</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1765">It sounds like that is a real problem. Let’s set up a consult call and I can see if my company can help.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1766">Yeah, going vegan is so hard. I have a few recipes I can send you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1767">If nothing comes up during a conversation, you can also end with a tie. I typically end most of my great meetings with a single question:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-1768" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-1769">Can I help you with anything?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1770">This is my favorite Thread Theory question<span class="strong">.</span> Not only does it give me a chance to create a tie, but also I usually end up learning something new about them. It’s a tiny hack that goes a long way.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1771">In fact, every step of Thread Theory is others oriented in that it helps people untangle their own bundles of thoughts. For example, going through the Five Whys with a friend can help them figure out why things aren’t working at their job. Following a thread with a partner could help you both figure out vacation plans.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1772"><span class="strong">Remember:</span> Since step three of the Thread Theory is optional, you actually have to mean it when you use it. Don’t offer help you can’t give. <a id="calibre_link-1773" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Don’t make hollow promises. Create ties only with people who you genuinely want to be connected to.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-1774"><span class="bolditalic">Bonus: Teach Me?</span></h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1775">What if you can’t find a thread? What if there are no authentic opportunities for “Me too”?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1776">Lewis Howes frequently interviews experts on his podcast in new areas of business or life, and when he can’t say “Me too,” he says, “Teach me.” This produces incredible content for his listeners <em class="calibre6">and</em> deep connections between him and his experts. If someone mentions something that you don’t know about or are unfamiliar with, ask for more information. “Teach me?” is still a thread!</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1777">Here are some ways you can make “Teach me?” a thread:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1778" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1779">I have never heard of that book&mdash;what is it about?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1780">What an interesting career&mdash;I have never met anyone in your line of work before. Tell me about it!</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1781">I’ve actually never been out of the country, but would love to travel more. Have any insider tips for a beginner?</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1782"><span class="strong">Bottom Line:</span> “Me too!” and “Teach me?” are two of the most powerful and underutilized phrases we have. Use them whenever possible.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-1783">CHALLENGES</h5>
<ol id="calibre_link-1784" class="calibre9">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1785" value="1">Next time you talk to someone, try finding three commonalities in the first three minutes.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1786" value="2">Practice asking “why?” five times and see if you learn something new.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1787" value="3">Create a tie by asking a colleague or friend if you can help them with anything.</li>
</ol>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-1788">CHAPTER REVIEW</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1789">The more you have in common with someone, the more likable you become. We like people like us. The Thread Theory is an easy way to captivate attraction by simply searching for shared interests, asking why, and then offering to help. Always be on the lookout for ways to say, “Me too!”</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1790" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1791"><a id="calibre_link-1792" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Don’t overthink what you are going to say, just search for commonalities.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1793">Go deeper by asking the Five Whys.</li>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1803">Dr. Mike Cruz is the new head of the ER at All Saints Hospital in Manhattan. He’s headstrong, direct, and a little intimidating.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1804">Dr. Cruz needs the support of his staff in turning the All Saints ER into a premier trauma center. But shaking up systems and changing protocols has led to an all-out battle with longtime doctors and nurses.</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1807">Dr. Cruz eyes it suspiciously as Zoey continues. “It has their birthdays, anniversaries, things that make them sad, things that make them happy. Who cries when a patient dies, who makes a joke and then cries in private. It’s the things you should know.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1808">Dr. Cruz flips through the book halfheartedly. Finally he asks, “Why are you giving me this?”</p>

<h3 class="eb04mainheadclosedtitle" id="calibre_link-1821">How to uncover hidden emotions</h3>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1822">I have a sad story to tell you&mdash;but don’t worry, it has a happy ending.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1823">In the 1970s, there was a forty-two-year-old housewife who was having a midlife crisis. To protect her identity, we will call her Mary. Upon reaching her fortieth birthday, Mary found herself alone most of the time. Her children had grown and moved out of the house, and her husband was a busy professional. At night she had difficulty sleeping, and during the day she had a harder and harder time managing the house. Frequently, she spent most of the day crying. She complained of feeling overwhelmingly “useless.” Finally, she began to contemplate suicide.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1824">Luckily, Mary knew she needed help. Her family admitted her to a local hospital for extra care. The first three weeks of treatment went well&mdash;a combination of group therapy and medication seemed successful. During one of Mary’s filmed sessions with her psychiatrist, Mary insisted she was feeling significantly better. Given her improved mood, Mary asked, perhaps she could get a weekend pass to visit her family? After consulting with the staff, the doctor agreed with the team: Mary was better.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1825">Fortunately, right before checking out, Mary came clean. She went to her doctor and admitted that she had been lying in her interview and faking it in group therapy sessions. She was still desperately depressed. The coming weekend, she’d planned to do something drastic away from the hospital. But her confession marked a true turning point in her recovery, and after many months of treatment&mdash;overcoming a few relapses&mdash;Mary went on to lead a normal life with her family.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1826">Despite this happy ending, the Mary incident left the hospital’s <a id="calibre_link-1827" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>medical team rattled. <span class="strong">How had she deceived so many people in the facility?</span> The hospital staff reviewed a video recording of the doctor’s interview with Mary&mdash;what had they missed? In fact, medical deception is a worrying dilemma&mdash;patients frequently lie to their doctors, and psychologists dread being fooled by patients who hide their real health needs.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1828">After multiple experienced psychologists reviewed Mary’s film without answers, the team decided to get more help. They enlisted Dr. Paul Ekman, a young psychologist who had been conducting experiments on human lie detection with patients.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-265" href="#calibre_link-102" class="calibre4 pcalibre">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1829">Dr. Ekman and his team spent hundreds of hours reviewing Mary’s footage. It wasn’t until he put the video in slow motion that clues began to emerge. When the doctor asked Mary about her plans for the weekend, a frightening emotion leaked out. You just had to know where to look.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1830">“We saw in slow-motion a fleeting facial expression of despair, so quick that we had missed seeing it the first few times we examined the film,” explained Dr. Ekman.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-266" href="#calibre_link-103" class="calibre4 pcalibre">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1831">This flicker of sorrow was the break that Ekman and his team needed. They began to re-examine the footage looking for these microgestures. After a few rounds, they started spotting them consistently&mdash;always right before a lie, and often covered by a fake smile. Dr. Ekman came to call these flickering facial gestures “microexpressions.”</p>

<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-1835">FACE SCIENCE</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1836">Doctors once thought babies learned to smile by mimicking the doting expressions of their mothers and fathers. This is a myth.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1837">Congenitally blind babies make the same facial expressions as other babies&mdash;despite having never seen a face.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-267" href="#calibre_link-104" class="calibre4 pcalibre">3</a></sup> Our instinct to make certain expressions derives from nature, not nurture.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-268" href="#calibre_link-105" class="calibre4 pcalibre">4</a></sup> <span class="strong">Microexpressions are an innate universal human behavior.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1838">Fascinated by this idea, Dr. Paul Ekman conducted a series of studies in a remote part of New Guinea.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-269" href="#calibre_link-106" class="calibre4 pcalibre">5</a></sup> He brought with him photos of Americans expressing different emotions&mdash;showing everything from <a id="calibre_link-1839" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>smiles to grimaces to frowns. The tribe he was visiting was especially disconnected from the Western world. They’d never seen a movie, much less a TV.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1840">With a translator’s help, Dr. Ekman asked the New Guineans to examine the Americans’ facial expressions and guess what they thought each American was feeling in the picture. Dr. Ekman was shocked to find that their guesses were extremely accurate.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-270" href="#calibre_link-107" class="calibre4 pcalibre">6</a></sup> They could even perform the experiment in reverse. As Ekman named an emotion, participants quickly mimed the corresponding facial expression.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1841">After repeating this experiment with participants all around the world, Dr. Ekman was able to identify seven universal microexpressions.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1846">While my husband watches <em class="calibre6">Monday Night Football</em> on ESPN, I am glued to ABC for my weekly Monday dose of <em class="calibre6">The Bachelorette</em>. It’s trashy TV that I insist is “for work” to “observe human behavior.” Really, I just want to win my Bachelorette Fantasy League.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1847">In one particularly notable season, bachelorette Emily Maynard meets Arie Luyendyk Jr., a dreamy race car driver from Arizona. There are twenty-five men competing to win Emily’s heart and propose to her at the end of the season. Tall with a big smile and blue eyes, Arie has potential to go all the way. There is only one problem. Emily’s former fiancé was also a race car driver and tragically died on the way to a race. Could Arie’s profession hit too close to home? Let me tell you, viewers like me were on the edge of our seats to find out.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1848">The night of the confession, Arie sits Emily down to “tell her something.” Emily smiles demurely, waiting for the potential bomb to drop. Here’s a recap of just the verbal exchange:</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1905">During this interaction, Emily showed three crucial microexpressions: sadness, fear, and contempt. These were key because they were <a id="calibre_link-1906" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>incongruent with her words. Even though her words said she was fine, her true emotions were displayed on her face.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1907">Emily didn’t choose Arie in the end. He made it to the final two before being cut. Anyone who could read microexpressions would not have been surprised by Arie’s fate. His profession was a deal breaker.

</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1912">Decoding is all about looking for the emotional intent behind the words. It’s about listening by hearing <em class="calibre6">and</em> looking.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1913">First, here’s how to use the Decoder hack:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-1914" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1915"><span class="strong">Congruency</span>: Look to see if someone’s stated emotions match their visible emotions. If your client says he is happy to see you, he should have a happy microexpression. If your wife says she is “fine,” but has an angry microexpression, she probably isn’t “fine.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1916"><span class="strong">Connection:</span> People make microexpressions while they are talking <em class="calibre6">and</em> while they are listening. Facial expressiveness is never “off.” While this can be a lot to take in, paying consistent attention to someone’s face also helps you with Hack #2&mdash;the eye contact piece of the Triple Threat. If you thought your average eye contact was below 60 percent, then reading microexpressions is an easy way to incentivize more gazing.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-1917"><span class="strong">Speed</span>: Microexpressions happen incredibly quickly&mdash;in less than a second. Anything longer than a second is simply a facial expression. Why is this important? Microexpressions (less than a second) cannot be controlled, so they are honest views into emotions. Facial expressions (longer than a second) can be faked and are less honest. Therefore, you should look at brief flashes of facial responsiveness for the most accurate reading.</li>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1938">Contempt&mdash;scorn, disdain, or disrespect&mdash;is quite a powerful and complex emotion that is marked by an extremely simple facial gesture. Contempt is often called “smirking” because it is a one-sided mouth raise.</p>

Over 22,000 people have taken this quiz. Contempt is the one that gets the most wrong answers. Of all the emotions, contempt seems to stump 40 percent of people (followed closely by fear, which 35 percent of people get wrong).</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1940">Contempt confuses us because we mistake the smirk for a partial smile or boredom, but that could not be further from the truth. Contempt is a cue of serious dislike and scorn. We often show contempt when we feel that someone or something is beneath our attention.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1975">When we are afraid, our body often goes into fight-or-flight response. Our facial expression actually helps us respond quickly and accurately to <a id="calibre_link-1976" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>threats. As soon as we are afraid, our eyes widen and our eyebrows go up our forehead&mdash;this way we can take in as much of our environment as possible to look for potential escapes or more threats. Then, our mouth opens and we gasp for breath&mdash;taking in oxygen in case we have to yell for help or flee.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-1992">Surprise is a great truth-telling emotion. For example, if you ask a colleague, “Did you know I was going to be taken off the project?” surprise will tell you instantly that they had no idea. If they show fear, it can be a clue of their previous knowledge.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-1993">Surprise is easy to spot because it is the longest of the microexpressions. The mouth drops open and the eyebrows shoot up the forehead.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2030">This is the expression most accurately portrayed by emoticons. A frowny face really does mean that someone is in a downy place. Sadness is the hardest microexpression to fake, so when you see it you know that you have hit a deep feeling. It is also the precursor expression to crying, so it can help you predict when someone is going to burst into tears.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2031"><a id="calibre_link-2032" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>The sadness microexpression is marked by:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-2033" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2034">Corners of the eyebrows pinched together</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2035">Drooping of the eyelids</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2036">Puffing or pouting of the lower lip</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2037">Pulling the corners of the mouth down into a frown</li>
</ul>
<div class="landscape_default" id="calibre_link-2038"><img src="images/000055.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-381" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2039">You often see a sadness microexpression in the following situations:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-2040" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2041">When someone is disappointed</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2042">Right before they’re about to cry</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2043">If they’re overwhelmed or upset</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-2044">Step #2: Responding</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2045">While microexpressions give you tremendous insight into someone’s emotional state, spotting them is only the first step of the Decoder hack. Choosing a response comes next. Here are a few strategies.</p>
<h4 class="headcnbs" id="calibre_link-2046"><span class="bolditalic">Anger</span></h4>
<div class="landscape_default" id="calibre_link-2047"><img src="images/000056.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-395" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2048">When I see anger, I think <span class="strong">opportunity</span>. Why? If you spot anger, you know that you have the opportunity to explain, dispel, and get to the truth.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2049"><a id="calibre_link-2050" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Let’s say, for example, you are pitching a project to a new client. The presentation is going swimmingly&mdash;they seem very engaged, are asking great questions, and nodding along with your points. Then you get to the price. Right as you mention the cost of the project, your client flashes anger at you&mdash;across the boardroom table you can easily see those two vertical lines appear between their eyebrows.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2051"><span class="strong">Typical Response:</span> If you continue with your pitch, you leave questions unanswered. Yet the typical response is to just barrel through the rest of the material you planned to present and hope the anger evaporates. At the end of your talk, you’d be lucky if your client brought up his or her suspicions on pricing. Most wouldn’t. Then you’d be stuck wondering why they said no.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2052"><span class="strong">Using the Decoder:</span> Immediately pause and explain the reasons you arrived at your price&mdash;so your client has the full context and understands your perspective. Then, before moving on to your next slide, ask if there are any remaining questions about the price. Once you have finished the pitch, circle back to the price and see if you still spot the anger.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2053"><span class="strong">How to Respond:</span></p>
<ul class="nts" id="calibre_link-2054">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2055">Explore&mdash;where is the anger coming from and how can you oust it?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2056">Stay Calm&mdash;not offensive or defensive.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2057">Explain&mdash;what information can you give them to feel less threatened?</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="headcnbs" id="calibre_link-2058"><span class="bolditalic">Contempt</span></h4>
<div class="landscape_default" id="calibre_link-2059"><img src="images/000057.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-396" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2060">When I see contempt, I think <span class="strong">red flag</span>. Contempt is a devious little emotion. When it isn’t addressed, it festers and grows into deep disrespect and hatred. This is why you need to tackle it the moment you see it.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2061">Remember that spotting contempt doesn’t mean that someone is a contemptuous person or that they think <em class="calibre6">you</em> are a contemptuous person. People can have disdain for an idea or a situation while still having a <a id="calibre_link-2062" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>great relationship with you. This is why it is important to identify the trigger and talk it through so you can use it to strengthen your relationship and learn more about them.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2063">Let’s say you are working with a colleague on a new project. You sit down over coffee to hammer out the details. You easily agree on a fair way to divvy up the project tasks and move on to the timeline. When you mention your six-week goal, you spot a microexpression of contempt.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2064"><span class="strong">Typical Response:</span> Ignore it&mdash;you know it’s a tight turnaround, but it’s all hands on deck for this one. Six weeks later, you are surprised when your colleague says he is at least two weeks behind. Now it’s up to you to pick up the slack.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2065"><span class="strong">A Hacker’s Response:</span> Go into information-seeking mode and figure out exactly what your colleague is worried about. What are his expectations for deliverables? How can you re-evaluate to help him (and you) get this project done on time? Either decide on a new timeline or change the deliverables to be more equitable.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2066"><span class="strong">How to Respond:</span></p>
<ul class="nts" id="calibre_link-2067">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2068">Find the source&mdash;what exactly is causing this contempt?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2069">Re-evaluate&mdash;how can you address the contemptuous issue?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2070">Build rapport&mdash;where can you agree?</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="headcnbs" id="calibre_link-2071"><span class="bolditalic">Happiness</span></h4>

<div class="caption1" id="calibre_link-2073">Fake happiness (above) sends completely different social signals than real happiness.</div>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2074">When I see happiness, I think <span class="strong">celebration</span>! Happiness is one of the most beautiful and joyous emotions&mdash;savor it, capitalize on it, celebrate it! Don’t let happiness go unnoticed.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2075">Let’s say your partner had an amazing day at work. He bursts through the door right as you are cooking dinner. He whistles as he takes off his coat and saunters into the kitchen shouting, “Hey, honey, I have great news!” Hugging you from behind, he asks if there is any champagne to celebrate. You turn and see he is beaming with a huge smile.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2076"><span class="strong">Typical Response:</span> You have pasta on boil, veggies sautéing, and wine <a id="calibre_link-2077" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>already open&mdash;“No, we can’t chill champagne, I just opened this bottle of red!” you say. Then, “Babe, watch out, the pasta is hot, I have to keep stirring.” As you try to finish making dinner, you say to your partner, “Tell me the good news as you set the table.” Your partner is a little deflated. He still shares the news, but doesn’t feel nearly as excited as he did when he came home. You have a normal dinner.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2078"><span class="strong">A Hacker’s Response:</span> “Tell me! Tell me! Let me turn this heat down so you can tell me everything,” you exclaim. He shares his major win at work while you put a cork in your wine and throw a bottle of champagne into the fridge. “We have to celebrate,” you say. Dinner takes a little bit longer, but you get to clink glasses and ride the high of his work win together.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2079"><span class="strong">How to Respond:</span></p>
<ul class="nts" id="calibre_link-2080">

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2087">It’s your mother’s birthday and you have a big family get-together planned. It’s going to be a fun party&mdash;she’s turning sixty, so you and your siblings saved up to get her an iPad for her to watch her favorite shows while she cooks.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2088">After dinner, your mom begins opening presents. She gets to yours and goes all teary-eyed while reading the card from you and your siblings. After ripping off the wrapping paper, she looks down at the brand-new iPad and leather case. She flashes a microexpression of fear before gushing about how generous her children are. Then she rushes off to serve the cake.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2089"><span class="strong">Typical Response:</span> Nailed it! You and your siblings are very proud of your gift. You can’t wait for your mom to use it. A few weeks later, she still <a id="calibre_link-2090" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>hasn’t taken it out of the box. A few months later, she has opened it and put it in the case, but refuses to do more than play Scrabble on the free app you downloaded for her. Why did you get her this nice gift if she isn’t going to use it!?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2091"><span class="strong">A Hacker’s Response:</span> After cake, you take your mom aside and ask her if she is excited about the iPad. “Of course!” she says. But you spot that fear again. You offer to come over in the next few days and give her a tutorial on the iPad. She sighs with relief.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2092">After a few sessions, she has figured out Netflix and her e-mail. You also sign her up for a free iPad class offered at the Apple Store. She comes back with a list of cool new apps she thinks <em class="calibre6">you</em> would like. Nailed it!</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2100">When I see surprise, <span class="strong">I hope we are on the same page</span>. Sometimes, you mean to evoke surprise&mdash;using a conversation sparker or delivering good news. Other times, their surprise surprises you.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2101">You’re having lunch with an old friend. It’s been forever since you have been able to catch up, so you spend the first twenty minutes just updating each other on what’s been going on in your lives. The appetizers finally come and you begin to reminisce about college.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2102">“Can you believe,” you ask, “that Robby just got engaged?!” Your friend flashes a look of surprise.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2103"><span class="strong">Typical Response:</span> You assume she knows&mdash;doesn’t everyone? Sure, Robby didn’t post about it on Facebook (he doesn’t use Facebook because of his job). But you figure it’s common knowledge. You breeze past the topic. A few days later, you hear through the grapevine that you spilled the beans. Robby was waiting to tell his parents before sending out announcements to everyone&mdash;your leak got back to them before he could share his news. Oops. You are definitely not invited to the wedding.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2104"><span class="strong">A Hacker’s Response:</span> You spot the surprise and clarify, “Didn’t you know?” Your friend shakes her head and says, “I had no idea!” Thinking <a id="calibre_link-2105" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>quickly, you say, “Hey, I’m sure he’ll want to tell everyone himself&mdash;if you can keep it under wraps until he announces, that would be great.” Crisis averted. Wedding open bar is in your future.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2113">When I see disgust, I think <span class="strong">we better get to the bottom of this</span>. People often flash disgust when they are trying to think of a polite way to say they don’t like something. When we are worried about offending people, we keep our true feelings of disgust under wraps. However, if you want to get to the truth, you have to give people permission to express their real feelings.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2114">Let’s say you are hiring a new employee. Everything in the interview is going great&mdash;he has a solid résumé and a positive attitude. As you explain the different parts of the job, you notice that your interviewee flashes disgust when bringing up that the job is paperwork heavy. There is a lot of filing, alphabetizing, and photocopying that happens at the end of each week.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2115"><span class="strong">Typical Response:</span> Hope for the best. Everything looks good and you really think he is a great candidate for the position. You are shocked when at the end of his first month, none of your client invoices have been sent out. Why? There was a bottleneck in the filing system. He had been pushing off his weekly paperwork tasks and now all of your payments are late.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2116"><span class="strong">A Hacker’s Response:</span> Noticing the disgust, you ask the candidate if he did much paperwork in the past. “Oh no,” he says, “I am great with strategy and ideas, but not great at organization.” He tells you in his last job he had an office assistant help with those tasks. After the interview, <a id="calibre_link-2117" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>you go back to your boss to approve budget to hire him a secretary. He’s worth it, so you want to focus on his strengths and delegate his weaknesses.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2118">Once he joins the staff, the entire office increases efficiency and you’re able to double production.</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2127">Let’s say you are working with a contractor to redesign a bathroom in your house. The contractor comes highly recommended from your neighbors and you love his work. You have talked on the phone, but today the contractor is going to evaluate the scope of the project and give you a bid. When he comes up to the front door, you shake hands and say, “Nice to meet you. How are you?” He says, “I’m all right,” but you notice a microexpression of sadness.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2128"><span class="strong">Typical Response:</span> You have work to do! You are hoping and praying the project is within your budget. You offer the contractor some water and then tour the bathroom. After a few minutes, the contractor says he has all he needs. You are shocked&mdash;he spent no more than ten minutes in the space and barely measured anything! As he is gathering his stuff, you ask for an estimated price. He gives you a number double what you expected. There is no way you can do it. Looks like you will be stuck with the old bathroom or have to start from scratch finding a new contractor.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2129"><span class="strong">A Hacker’s Response:</span> You spot the sadness so you ask, “Yeah? Everything ok?” The contractor sighs and says, “Long day, you know those?” You <a id="calibre_link-2130" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>get him a glass of water and say, “Those are rough. Is anything wrong?” He tells you that he just found out his father’s in the hospital. He can’t run over and check on him until after your appointment. You immediately tell him that you can reschedule. He should definitely be with his father.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2131">The next day, he calls to say everything is fine&mdash;it was just a false alarm, but he is so grateful for your understanding. He comes back that afternoon in a great mood and gives you an excellent price on the project.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2138">While the seven microexpressions are universal, there are a few special exceptions I want you to keep in mind before diving into the world of facial responsiveness.</p>
<h4 class="headcnbs" id="calibre_link-2139"><span class="bolditalic">The Eyebrow Raise</span></h4>
<div class="landscape_default" id="calibre_link-2140"><img src="images/000063.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-382" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2141">An isolated eyebrow raise might look like partial surprise, but it is actually an indication of interest. We raise our eyebrows as if to say, “Oh really?” or “Fascinating!” Offering affirmation like this is an excellent addition to the Triple Threat.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2142">You can also use the eyebrow raise to highlight something important you’re saying. For example, teachers often raise their eyebrows when they get to a particularly important part of their lesson. This is a subconscious <a id="calibre_link-2143" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>way we call attention to our words. And, frequently, the most engaged student listeners will raise their eyebrows right back to show that they find it interesting, too.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2144"><span class="strong">Eyebrow raises show:</span></p>
<ul class="nts" id="calibre_link-2145">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2146">Engagement</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2147">Attention</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2148">Curiosity</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-2149"><span class="bolditalic">Facial Punctuators</span></h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2150">Just as we use our hands to emphasize our words, we use rapid facial movements to accent or punctuate what’s being said.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-272" href="#calibre_link-110" class="calibre4 pcalibre">8</a></sup> For example, we might bite our lips to show nervousness or puff out our cheeks to show frustration. This is a way we add dimension or expressiveness to our verbal communication.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2151">Facial punctuators are a normal part of interaction. Occasionally, people will use one of the seven microexpressions as their facial punctuator. For example, Simon Cowell, the infamous <em class="calibre6">American Idol</em> judge who rips contestants to shreds, uses contempt as his facial punctuator. No wonder he’s stereotyped as the critical one. Yet for him, contempt is a means of accenting his statements, and isn’t necessarily a sign of inner derision.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2152">If you notice someone using one of the seven microexpressions frequently along with their words, it might just be their facial punctuator.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2153">Facial punctuators:</p>
<ul class="nts" id="calibre_link-2154">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2155">Highlight ideas</li>

<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-2158"><span class="bolditalic">Squelching</span></h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2159">Squelching is the result of trying to hide a microexpression, which creates a mishmash of facial gestures.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2160">Have you ever tried to suppress a yawn? Your body has a really hard time stopping itself, so you make a crazy expression&mdash;squishing your eyes closed, cranking your mouth shut and tensing your cheek muscles. It’s a very similar feeling and look when someone tries to hide or contain a microexpression. It can be an indication of embarrassment or a concealed lie.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2161"><a id="calibre_link-2162" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>If you notice someone make a squelched expression, be sure to dig deeper to find the source of the disguise.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2163">Squelching can be seen if someone is:</p>
<ul class="nts" id="calibre_link-2164">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2165">Lying</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2166">Embarrassed of their reaction</li>

<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-2168">THE SCIENCE OF SELFIES</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2169">These days, we very rarely have the luxury of making a first impression in person. An interviewer Googles you before your interview, a potential client adds you on LinkedIn after getting your e-mail, or you meet someone on Tinder before going out on a real date. The question is: <span class="strong">What does your digital microexpression say?</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2170">When making a first impression, you get the luxury of a few seconds in real life&mdash;online it’s not so cushy. Princeton University researcher Dr. Alexander Todorov found that you make a snap judgment about someone online within 100 milliseconds of seeing their picture.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-273" href="#calibre_link-111" class="calibre4 pcalibre">9</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2171">The good news is that you’re in control of the messages you send in your photo. Whether you have an e-mail avatar, a social media profile picture, or a business head shot, you can use the seven microexpressions to send the right signals.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2172">In another experiment, Dr. Todorov found that different images of the same person can create drastically different first impressions. Participants changed their minds about a person’s intelligence, trustworthiness, and attractiveness depending on what picture they were looking at.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-274" href="#calibre_link-112" class="calibre4 pcalibre">10</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2173">We did a mini-experiment in our lab that we called Hot or Not, indeed using the website <a href="http://HotorNot.com" class="pcalibre calibre5">HotorNot.com</a>. If you’re unfamiliar, visitors to the website “rate” pictures of strangers. We coded four hundred photos of men and women and found that the “hottest” photos had different patterns than the photos with the lowest scores.<a id="calibre_link-421" class="footnote_link pcalibre" type="noteref" href="#calibre_link-113">fn2</a></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2174">Specifically in regard to microexpressions&mdash;photos with fake smiles or closed mouth smiles got lower ratings. Be sure your profile pictures <a id="calibre_link-2175" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>aren’t accidentally showing negative microexpressions. Common mistakes are:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-2176" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2177">Showing contempt in an attempt to look casual</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2178">Flashing fake happiness in lieu of a real smile</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2179">Squinting in the sun, which looks like an anger microexpression</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2180">Blinking or reacting to a flash, causing an accidental look of fear</li>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2187">One final reminder: Follow your instincts.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2188">Just as we are wired to show microexpressions, we are also wired to read them. This hack teaches you the names for what you already know. If you ever forget what a facial expression means or can’t recognize an expression, try to mimic it. When you copy a facial expression, you will often feel the emotion it portrays. This is because of something called the facial feedback hypothesis.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-275" href="#calibre_link-114" class="calibre4 pcalibre">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2189">The hypothesis is that our facial expressions and our emotions are <a id="calibre_link-2190" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>connected in a loop. When you feel an emotion, it is expressed on your face. On the other hand, when you have an expression on your face, you also feel that emotion. This is a great ninja tip&mdash;if you want to really feel as someone else feels, copy their expression to glimpse their inner state.</p>

<h3 class="eb04mainheadclosedtitle" id="calibre_link-2207">How to crack someone’s personality</h3>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2208">In 1984, Procter &amp; Gamble, once the go-to brand for everything from soap to paper towels to vegetable oil, was thrown into crisis by the creeping encroachment of rival companies.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-277" href="#calibre_link-116" class="calibre4 pcalibre">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2209">Something had to change. Out of the blue, Richard Nicolosi, a shift foreman at Procter &amp; Gamble, was approached by a P&amp;G marketing executive about joining their team. “I didn’t even know how to spell marketing at the time,” said Nicolosi. But executives recognized his unique ability. They hoped his engineering mind could solve some of the company’s biggest problems.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2210">Nicolosi began doing what he knew best as a chemical engineer: solving puzzles. He applied this methodical way of thinking to his dealings with people, too. “<span class="strong">Getting the best out of people is like solving a puzzle,</span>” Nicolosi explained to me.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2211">He was given authority to carry out a massive reorganization and began dismantling division teams and assigning new leadership roles. But he knew he couldn’t assemble new teams from scratch based on nothing but résumé printouts. He believed the key was to assign the right person to the right team in the right category.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2212">Nicolosi had to find the best matchups, and find them fast. He developed a rigorous process that he still follows today. First, he sits down with each person and uses probing, insightful questions to seek to understand them. He both watches and listens&mdash;looking for body language tells, facial expressions, and behavioral traits.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2213">Second, he spends time with them&mdash;and not two arms’ lengths <a id="calibre_link-2214" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>removed. He tries to see them in action. “There is a world of difference between what people say and what people do,” said Nicolosi.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2215">Third, he listens to the words they use and then speaks their language back to them. This allows him to align what he wants to accomplish with what they want to accomplish.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2216">Armed with this intel about each of his employees, Nicolosi set up effective teams and new workflows that carried the company out of the 1984 slump and through many crises in years to come. By the end of 1988, profits were up 68 percent.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2217">Nicolosi began to teach his philosophy of people to many of P&amp;G’s other leading businesses: soaps, detergents, cleaning products, and soft drinks. He was the youngest-ever sector president, youngest-ever group vice president, and the youngest-ever corporate vice president. Eventually, he was asked to restructure Scott Paper, where he was able to double both operating profit to $700 million and increase return on investment to 23 percent in less than two years.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2218">When I asked Nicolosi what his secret was, he replied: “People come in a host of flavors, and understanding what flavor they are&mdash;and therefore what their hot buttons are&mdash;is necessary to lead and motivate them.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2219">Nicolosi solves people puzzles, and so can you.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-2220">SOLVING THE PEOPLE PUZZLE</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2221">I used to find people intimidating. I couldn’t keep personality differences straight. And I found it impossible to figure out behavior&mdash;let alone predict needs. Why did one friend love to chat while another never called me back? Why did some bosses encourage an open-door policy, while others used their secretary as a gatekeeper?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2222">Then, one day, I stumbled upon something called the five-factor model. This psychological principle posits that all humans have five basic personality traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (easily remembered as OCEAN). And each and every person ranks either high or low for each trait. Here’s a summary:<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-278" href="#calibre_link-117" class="calibre4 pcalibre">2</a></sup></p>
<ul class="none1" id="calibre_link-2223">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2224"><span class="strong">Openness:</span> This trait reflects how you approach new ideas. It also describes how curious you are, your level of creativity, and how much you appreciate variety and originality.</li>
<li class="eb24list_unsub" id="calibre_link-2225"><span class="bolditalic"><a id="calibre_link-2226" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>High:</span> Enjoys novelty, change, and adventure.</li>
<li class="eb24list_unsub" id="calibre_link-2227"><span class="bolditalic">Low:</span> Savors traditions, routines, and habits.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2228"><span class="strong">Conscientiousness:</span> This trait describes your approach to getting things done. It measures your self-discipline, organization, and reliability.</li>
<li class="eb24list_unsub" id="calibre_link-2229"><span class="bolditalic">High:</span> Loves to-do lists, organization, and schedules. Enjoys digging into the details and making things “perfect.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_unsub" id="calibre_link-2230"><span class="bolditalic">Low:</span> Typically prefers big ideas and strategy. Might find lists and schedules stifling and overwhelming.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2231"><span class="strong">Extroversion:</span> This trait describes how you approach people. Do you get energy from social situations, or do they drain you? This probably affects your talkativeness and optimism.</li>
<li class="eb24list_unsub" id="calibre_link-2232"><span class="bolditalic">High:</span> Gets energy from being with people. Tends to be cheerful and seeks out social time.</li>
<li class="eb24list_unsub" id="calibre_link-2233"><span class="bolditalic">Low:</span> Craves alone time and finds being with people draining.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2234"><span class="strong">Agreeableness:</span> This trait describes how you approach cooperation and working with others. It also speaks to how empathetic and quick to forgive you are, and how much attention you pay to the mental states of others.</li>
<li class="eb24list_unsub" id="calibre_link-2235"><span class="bolditalic">High:</span> Easy to get along with, very empathetic, and enjoys caring for others.</li>
<li class="eb24list_unsub" id="calibre_link-2236"><span class="bolditalic">Low:</span> More analytical, practical, and skeptical&mdash;prefers to keep emotions out of decisions.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2237"><span class="strong">Neuroticism:</span> This trait describes how you approach worry. It also explains how emotionally reactive you are to your environment.</li>
<li class="eb24list_unsub" id="calibre_link-2238"><span class="bolditalic">High:</span> Tends to be a worrier. Frequently experiences mood swings.</li>
<li class="eb24list_unsub" id="calibre_link-2239"><span class="bolditalic">Low:</span> Typically calm, stable, and has very little mood fluctuation.</li>

<div class="portrait_small" id="calibre_link-2240"><img src="images/000064.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-2241" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2242">These traits gave me a starting point. I began to “solve” each of the important people in my life by looking at their behavioral patterns. For fun, I created small ciphers for each person, like this:</p>
<div class="portrait_small" id="calibre_link-2243"><img src="images/000065.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-2244" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2245">Then I would guess, based on their choices, <a id="calibre_link-2246" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>attitudes, and behaviors, where they fell in each category. Here was one I made for my boss at the time:</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2247">I came to call each of these little ciphers a matrix. After a few weeks of making a matrix for everyone in my life, something interesting happened. I noticed that many of my relationships and conversations were beginning to change.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2248">First, my conversations were flowing much more smoothly. I finally had a guide for easy banter&mdash;I just asked people questions that helped me solve their matrix. For example, I was no longer anxious when I ran into my boss in the break room. When trying to figure out if he was high open (likes trying new things), I asked about his most recent vacations and then his career path. This led to a great rapport, and, eventually, his asking me to grab lunch “to continue this great conversation.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2249">Second, I was arriving at a much deeper and more accurate understanding of the people in my life. Once I learned my boss was a low extrovert (preferred to work and brainstorm alone), I got in the habit of sending him my ideas before our office meetings so he could review them on his own time&mdash;he always got back to me first and prioritized my ideas.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2250">Finally, I was getting faster at decoding new personalities. After only a few minutes of chitchat, I could guess how someone would rank. When I met my boss’s wife, I was able to instantly connect with her by asking about her favorite restaurants. Her answer helped me predict which topics of conversation she might enjoy most, leading to a lively discussion over drinks.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2251">Without realizing it, I was following Nicolosi’s guide to figuring people out. I was asking purposeful questions. I was listening and watching for behavioral clues. Then, I was using their individual cipher, or personality matrix, to predict and optimize for their behavior.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2252">This led me to one of my most powerful people hacks: speed-reading. Before you learn to master it yourself, let’s talk about where personality comes from.</p>
<div class="boxnbs" id="calibre_link-2253">
<h5 class="box_title" id="calibre_link-2254"><span class="strong">FAST FACT BOX</span></h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2255">Most people in our survey felt their personality was their best asset.</p>

<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-2257"><a id="calibre_link-2258" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>PERSONALITY SCIENCE</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2259">Researchers have long been interested in personality, but it wasn’t until the 1980s that Dr. Lewis Goldberg cultivated the first major breakthrough, finding that the five-factor model, which Dr. Goldberg nicknamed “the Big Five,” was the most accurate.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-279" href="#calibre_link-118" class="calibre4 pcalibre">3</a></sup> Since then, the Big Five has been used as the standard in academia and has been found to be more reliable than Myers-Briggs, DiSC, or Enneagram personality measures.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2260">Personalities play a huge role in how we make decisions, form goals, and balance work and relationships. And we usually can’t control them. About 35 to 50 percent of your personality is wired into your genetic makeup. Your upbringing, another factor you have zero say in, also shapes you considerably.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2261">Ever wish your colleague was more organized? Ever try to make your partner less of a homebody? Ever try to calm your friend down from worrying so much? This never works! We can’t alter people’s nature. Instead of trying to change the people in your life, learn how to decode, optimize, and predict their behavior.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2262">First, let’s start with a self-assessment.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-280" href="#calibre_link-119" class="calibre4 pcalibre">4</a></sup> Be as honest as you can:</p>

This is totally normal. You belong in the middle if you can see yourself having both high and low qualities at different times.

<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-2354">SPEED-READING THE MATRIX</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2355">By the end of 2014, our lab was booming. I was swamped with new projects, my speaking calendar was completely full, and we had just enrolled over 40,000 students in our online courses. We needed help.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2356">Luckily, three new interns were starting in our lab. I couldn’t wait to get more hands on deck. Everything started out peachy. By their fourth day, the interns were helping manage our active social media accounts.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2357">About two weeks in, we hit a snag. One of the interns&mdash;I’ll call her Eva&mdash;was struggling to complete tasks. No worries, I thought, I’ll just send her more-detailed instructions.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2358">But the following week, her incomplete projects were still backing up the rest of my team. No worries, I thought, I’ll check in with her and ask her what she’d personally prefer to work on. Over lunch, we sat down together and I suggested some new projects she might like. She was on board! We were looking good.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2359">A week later, I found out she hadn’t even started on the tasks we’d talked about. No worries, I thought, I’ll just pair her with an older team member as a mentor.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2360">A week later, Eva sent me an e-mail saying she wanted to quit. I was flummoxed: What went wrong?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2361">The answer was simple: I had failed to decode her matrix. I was interacting with Eva according to my personality traits, not hers. Since then, I have developed a system for solving someone’s matrix.</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-2362" class="calibre8">

</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2365">Speed-reading is a three-step hack&mdash;first you must decipher your own personality, then quickly figure out the person you are interacting with, then decide whether to compromise or optimize.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2366">I have taught this method to over 12,500 students all over the world. <a id="calibre_link-2367" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>We have had over 18,000 people take our personality test in our lab. Of all of the people hacks I teach, this is the one I get the most excited e-mails about.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2368">Speed-reading is a relationship game changer. When used correctly, it clears up miscommunications, prevents arguments, spices up chitchat, and accelerates bonding.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2369"><span class="strong">While speed-reading is one of my most powerful hacks, it is also extremely advanced.</span> If you have to read this section a few times, do it. If this hack takes you a little longer than others, embrace it. If it’s a little out of your comfort zone, do a little energizing jig and keep moving forward. I promise, it will change your relationships.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-2370">Step #1: You</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2371">Decoding your own matrix is the first step to speed-reading.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2372">Based on your scores earlier in this chapter, fill out the blank matrix below. Put a down arrow next to the traits you rank low in, an up arrow in the traits you rank high in, and an equal sign on the traits where you fall in the middle.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2373"><span class="strong">Special Note:</span> Some people find their personality traits are slightly different personally or professionally. If this is you, feel free to mark these two areas of your life in separate colors.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2374">Here is my matrix and explanations to give you an idea of how self-decoding works. Put your answers next to mine.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2375">My matrix was almost the opposite of my intern Eva’s. This is one reason we had such a hard time getting along. I tried to impose my personality onto her&mdash;and that never works out well:</p>
<div class="portrait_small" id="calibre_link-2376"><img src="images/000068.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-2377" class="calibre1" /></div>
<ul id="calibre_link-2378" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2379">I am high open, so I’m incredibly curious and love experimenting. I assumed Eva would also like being assigned fun new tasks at work and learning new skills. I picked her projects based on what I would have wanted, not what she would have wanted.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2380">I am high conscientious so I love details, plans, and to-do lists. I kept sending Eva more details in the hope they’d reassure and guide her.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2381"><a id="calibre_link-2382" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>I am a high neurotic, so I’m overly eager to make sure everyone on my team is happy. I was constantly checking in on Eva&mdash;which made her feel pressured.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2383">I am medium agreeable and medium extroversion, so I like working with people in the right circumstances&mdash;or in my thrive locations. I did not take Eva’s into account.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2384">This approach didn’t work&mdash;<span class="strong">in fact, it was a selfish way to interact.</span> I was seeing Eva through my personality instead of optimizing for hers.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-2385">Step #2: Them</h4>
<div class="portrait_small" id="calibre_link-2386"><img src="images/000069.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-2387" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2388">I realized a little too late that I was not using Eva’s matrix. Upon receiving her e-mail, I quickly pulled out a sheet of paper to decode her personality&mdash;which I should have done when I first hired her.</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-2389" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2390">Eva is low open, so she was overwhelmed by my flood of suggested projects.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2391">Eva is low conscientiousness, so my long, detailed e-mails intimidated her. She did not know how to start&mdash;so she didn’t start at all.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2392">Eva is highly agreeable, so she said yes to all my questions and projects, even though they scared her a bit. She was afraid to mess up the team flow or disappoint me, but wasn’t sure how to make it work.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2393">Eva is a low extrovert, so pairing her with a mentor <em class="calibre6">and</em> putting her on a team of three new interns thrust her into a survive scenario. Worse yet, she was uncomfortable asking for help.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2394">Eva is a medium neurotic, so she had trouble understanding my worry and got a little frustrated with my constant check-ins.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2395">Finally, her behavior and the failures in productivity made sense! Looking at her matrix next to mine not only cleared up previous misfires, but also let me know what steps to take next.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-2396"><span class="bolditalic"><a id="calibre_link-2397" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>The Direct Approach</span></h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2398">Begin to practice guessing the personality traits of people you meet. I highly recommend the direct approach for this. I frequently ask new friends, new hires, and new colleagues directly about their personality traits. This is the easiest and most straightforward way to decode someone’s matrix. Here are a few strategies:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-2399" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2400"><span class="strong">As a Conversation Starter:</span> “I’m reading this book about the five personality types&mdash;have you ever heard of them?” If they have, great&mdash;ask where they rank. If they haven’t, explain each one and guess each other’s on the spot.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2401"><span class="strong">As a Game:</span> “Hey, friend! I just stumbled upon this personality test at <a href="http://ScienceofPeople.com/personality" class="pcalibre calibre5">ScienceofPeople.com/personality</a>. Here are my scores. I would love to see yours!” You can use this direct approach with new hires and partners as well. People love taking quizzes!</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2402"><span class="strong">As a Formal Process:</span> These days, I make it a point to formally give the personality test to each of my interns the week they start. This also produces great office conversation.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2403"><span class="strong">As a Virtual Process:</span> There are many tools online that can also help you decipher people’s personality traits. The University of Cambridge created a free tool called Apply Magic Sauce that will scan your Facebook profile for cues to your personality using your posts, pictures, friends, and communication patterns as indicators.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2404"><span class="strong">As a Communication Process:</span> A tool called Crystal<a id="calibre_link-424" class="footnote_link pcalibre" type="noteref" href="#calibre_link-121">fn2</a> uses your e-mail history and people’s LinkedIn profiles to give you suggestions on their Big Five personality needs and how to communicate with them. For example, when I e-mail my colleague Danielle, it gives me e-mail templates on how best to communicate with her based on her personality and ideas on how to work well together:</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="headcnts" id="calibre_link-2406"><span class="bolditalic"><a id="calibre_link-2407" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>The Speed-Reading Approach</span></h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2408">If you don’t have time to directly ask people about their personalities&mdash;or feel you can’t&mdash;you can speed-read them. You’ll crunch data from their body language, verbal cues, and behavior to decode their personality matrix. <span class="strong">Every hack I have taught you so far was building up to this one.</span> As you speak with someone, listen for verbal cues and look for nonverbal clues. For example:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-2409" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2410">Asking an introvert, “Do you know anyone else here?” might make her nervous so that she flashes fear.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2411">Encouraging a low open friend to try a new restaurant or order something different might make them irritated so that they flash an anger microexpression at you.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2412">Pitching a low conscientious client with a long, detailed proposal might overwhelm them so they flash contempt when you hand them a large packet.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2413"><a id="calibre_link-2414" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>You can also use clues to decipher personality with what researcher Sam Gosling calls behavioral evidence. In a series of fascinating studies, Gosling analyzed participants’ personal belongings, rooms, and cubicles to decipher their personality types.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-281" href="#calibre_link-122" class="calibre4 pcalibre">5</a></sup> Using his findings, here is a list of casual questions to help you gauge personality traits, plus behaviors that are reliable personality evidence.</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2576">Somehow our brains recognize the “look” of a trait. Some studies indicate that we can subconsciously draw conclusions about personality based on face shape and bone structure. So here’s what you do when you first meet someone:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-2577" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2578"><span class="strong"><a id="calibre_link-2579" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Gut Check:</span> We are most accurate at speed-guessing extroversion, conscientiousness, and agreeableness&mdash;try to go with your first impression when assessing people in these areas.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-285" href="#calibre_link-127" class="calibre4 pcalibre">9</a></sup> Openness can be discerned best from someone’s physical space or face shape.</li>

<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2581"><span class="strong">Digital Check:</span> We can even draw conclusions about someone’s personality based on their online pictures and profiles.

</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2582">When you start speed-reading, you might be able to guess only two or three traits. This is a great place to start!

<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-2588"><span class="bolditalic">Ethical Speed-Reading</span></h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2589">Three final points to keep in mind while speed-reading:</p>
<ol id="calibre_link-2590" class="calibre9">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2591" value="1"><span class="strong">Speed-reading is about empathy.</span> Even attempting to speed-read someone gets you leagues ahead in the people game. Solving people’s matrices requires asking intentional questions, listening deeply, and trying to connect with someone on their terms. We want to be solved&mdash;it makes us feel heard and understood.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2592" value="2"><span class="strong">There is no “best” or “normal” personality orientation.</span> When you assign people trait labels, do so with no assumptions about what’s “right” or “wrong.” My goal is to help you diagnose and honor <a id="calibre_link-2593" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>someone’s natural tendencies and find out who someone really is, not who you want them to be. When you accept and optimize for who someone really is instead of trying to change or judge them, your interactions become much deeper, your conversations become smoother, and you are better able to predict behavior.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2594" value="3"><span class="strong">Personality traits are not stereotypes.</span> Don’t let assumptions about someone’s gender, race, or age block your ability to accurately decode someone. This is just one more reason to abandon any and all prejudice&mdash;it never helps you get along with or decode people.</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-2595">Step #3: Us</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2596">Once you have begun decoding someone’s personality, begin thinking about which of your traits are complementary and which put you in conflict.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2597">When your traits match, awesome. You’ll typically have smooth and well-balanced communication. When they don’t match, you have two options: You can optimize or you can compromise.</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2612">I experience the compromise-optimize decision on a daily basis with different personalities in my life. For example, I am high in conscientiousness and my husband is low. I love for the sock drawer to be organized by color, shape, and occasion. My husband doesn’t care if he is wearing two different socks, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ shells, or bonsai trees on <a id="calibre_link-2613" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>his feet. We tried to optimize&mdash;I attempted to teach him my method of advanced sock organization. This lasted precisely two days. Now we have two separate sock drawers on opposite sides of the closet. This has saved us a lot of headache.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2614">Here’s how the compromise-optimize method might have worked with Eva:</p>
<ul class="none1" id="calibre_link-2615">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2616"><span class="strong">Openness:</span> We are opposites on the openness spectrum.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2617"><span class="strong">Optimize:</span> Instead of assigning her new learning projects, I should have looked at her previous work history on her résumé and assigned her projects to build on her existing skill set&mdash;not start her on a totally new track.</li>
<li class="eb23listfirst" id="calibre_link-2618"><span class="strong">Conscientiousness:</span> We were also opposites in conscientiousness.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2619"><span class="strong">Compromise:</span> Since Eva was low in conscientiousness, I should have emphasized the big goals of each project, and then given her freedom to try tasks on her own before bombarding her with details.</li>
<li class="eb23listfirst" id="calibre_link-2620"><span class="strong">Extroversion:</span> As a low extrovert, Eva prefers to work on her own. In-person meetings are too overwhelming for her. I should have sent her work assignments in writing before our meetings.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2621"><span class="strong">Optimize:</span> It would have been no hassle for Eva to work on projects solo instead of sitting with the other interns. I also should have asked her to take our Science of People tutorials before her in-person training. She needed time to prepare questions and learn at her own speed.</li>
<li class="eb23listfirst" id="calibre_link-2622"><span class="strong">Agreeableness:</span> Yet another reason to have more e-mail contact and fewer in-person meetings was Eva’s level of agreeableness. She so wanted to please her new manager and coworkers.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2623"><span class="strong">Optimize:</span> Instead of sitting down together for weekly reviews, I should have arranged a more formal written review where she could give me feedback. She needed a safe space to state needs and set boundaries.</li>
<li class="eb23listfirst" id="calibre_link-2624"><span class="strong">Neuroticism:</span> As a high neurotic, I was freaking Eva out with all of my worries. She took it personally that I seemed to be micromanaging her.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2625"><span class="strong"><a id="calibre_link-2626" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Compromise:</span> Even though I can’t be less of a worrier (I wish!), I could have let Eva know that my check-ins were nothing personal. She had no idea that I do the same with everyone on my team. And I could have minimized her frustration by standardizing their timing (every Friday afternoon, for example), so she would’ve known what was coming.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="nts" id="calibre_link-2652">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2653"><span class="strong">High</span>: An extrovert is listening for social proof in a pitch&mdash;what do other team members think? They also won’t mind an impromptu group brainstorm session.

</ul></li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2657"><span class="strong">Low</span>: An introvert won’t like being put on the spot for questions. They’d prefer to have time to review your proposal on their own before making a decision.

<p class="list_head" id="calibre_link-2662"><span class="strong">Agreeableness Advantage</span></p>
<ul class="nts" id="calibre_link-2663">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2664"><span class="strong">High</span>: A high agreeable person might say yes to your face, but no later on. They typically want to avoid confrontation and protect everyone’s feelings&mdash;which might make them hesitant to bring up the real issues on their mind.
<ul class="squ1" id="calibre_link-2665">

<ul class="nts" id="calibre_link-2673">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2674"><span class="strong">High</span>: A high neurotic likes to hear that <em class="calibre6">you’re</em> worrying about everything for him. In other words, to keep a neurotic calm, convince them you’ve thought about and solved every potentiality so they don’t have to. This builds trust. Pro and con lists help show you have thought about both sides.

<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2676"><span class="bolditalic">Personal:</span> “I know you’re worried about what we should do. I think we should move. But let’s sit down and make a big pro and con list together. We should discuss backup plans, too.”</li>

<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2678"><span class="strong"><a id="calibre_link-2679" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Low</span>: A low neurotic isn’t as concerned with what-ifs, so bringing them up could worry them unnecessarily. Within reason, they will take your word for it. So do your due dilligence, mention you did your due dilligence, and leave it at that.
<ul class="squ1" id="calibre_link-2680">

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2694"><a id="calibre_link-2695" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>As you complete the challenge for people in your life, you might notice some interesting patterns.</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-2696" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2697"><span class="strong">Geography:</span> Depending on where you’re located, you might notice a high concentration of traits or personality patterns. Since a large part of personality is genetic, we see blooms of traits in certain areas. We also know that culture exerts a strong influence on traits. For example, Southern California and New York City are hubs of entrepreneurship, adventure, and living in the moment. Not surprisingly, more high open people live in these areas, so these areas attract more high open people to them.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2698"><span class="strong">Self-Selection:</span> I tend to get along better with high conscientious friends because they show up on time and are easier to plan with. In this way, I self-select my friends and favor certain personality types. You, your boss, and your friends might have similar personality types because that helps you get along and understand each other. Don’t be surprised if the important people in your life have similar matrices.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2699"><span class="strong">Workplace Culture:</span> When I was giving a presentation at Intel, an audience participant noted that Intel attracts and hires people with similar personality traits&mdash;typically high conscientious introverts. Certain corporations can attract a specific mix of personality types. A creative agency might hire high open, high extrovert <em class="calibre6">Mad Men</em> types, whereas a highly technical boss might hire and retain highly conscientious and highly agreeable employees. Your workplace might have people with similar matrices because they have either been hired by the same person or your corporate culture attracts a certain kind of individual.</li>

In the words of Richard Nicolosi, “I discovered that my real love was not marketing, but getting a visceral sense of who people are and what they want and why. It became my passion to get into other people’s mind-set.” Now it’s time for you to hack into other people’s mind-sets to help them&mdash;and you&mdash;succeed.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2721">Every time I see Paige Hendrix Buckner, she pulls a present for me out of her pocket or purse. Sometimes it’s herbs from her garden that she’s wrapped lovingly in a damp paper towel. Sometimes it’s my favorite kind of candy. Basically, she’s a younger, spunkier version of my grandma. She has a special talent for finding the perfect gift for each person she meets.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2722">A few years ago, she started capitalizing on her talent for gift giving. Local businesspeople told her they wanted to one-up the generic fruit basket when they sent presents to clients, employees, and business partners. Luckily, there is no better place than Paige’s home state of Oregon to find talented local artisans. This became her unique angle&mdash;working solely with the best Oregon products she could find and packaging them in distinctive handmade boxes with catchy themes. She named her company ClientJoy.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2723">In her Night on the Town box, she has Masala Spiced Popcorn, The Bitter Housewife’s cardamom bitters, Raft Lemon Ginger Syrup, flake salt by Jacobsen Salt Co., and hazelnuts by Albina City Nuts.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2724">In her Sweet and Spicy box, she has local honey from Bee Local, Tracy’s Small-Batch Granola, Marshall’s Gin Roasted Pepper Haute Sauce, and Olympia Provisions Pepperettes jerky.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2725">Following her passion had its challenges, but she has kept it alive by modeling on the side to pay for groceries and rent. (Paige is the stunning raven-haired model in many of the microexpression photos in this book!) Luckily, in the spring of 2014 Paige got her big break. ClientJoy boxes found their way into the hands of some serious influencers at TEDxPortland. “Speakers were blown away with authentically custom <a id="calibre_link-2726" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>gift boxes filled with love and creativity,” said the executive producer of the event, David Rae.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2727">The word got out. Now ClientJoy boxes are being sent to companies around the country, from the Dallas Cowboys to Twitter to <em class="calibre6">Time</em> magazine&mdash;everyone is getting a taste of Oregon.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2728">What has driven Paige’s success? ClientJoy makes curated gifts that don’t feel obligatory. “For me, gifting is about showing gratitude. It’s about making an easier way to give appreciation to someone. I think appreciation is one of the most powerful tools we have,” said Paige.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2729">ClientJoy taps into a deep human need&mdash;the desire to be genuinely appreciated.</p>

<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-2733">THE PSYCHOLOGY OF APPRECIATION</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2734">My dad’s birthday is November 4. This means that every August while growing up, I began the painstaking process of coming up with a spectacular gift idea.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2735">One year, I hand knit him a tie from yarn that I spun myself. Another year, I made an exact replica of his office in miniature using matchsticks, jewelry boxes, and buttons. Another year, I gave him a painting of a watermelon (his favorite food) covered in over 2,000 sequins (placed by hand one at a time). One year, I gave him a book of over thirty personalized coupons for things I knew he enjoyed, like hugs, Coffee Bean lattes, and Lakers games.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2736">At his birthday dinner, I would place my latest contraption in front of my dad and wait expectantly. Every year, he had about the same reaction: “Oh,” he would say cautiously. He would poke it, lift it up, and turn it around a few times. “I love it.” But he said this with the kind of voice tone reserved for telling a small child her imaginary friend had died or that the Christmas tree was infested with aphids. And then, a few weeks later, my loving creation would be moved to the attic. And eventually, I suspect, it was secretly placed in the alley garbage cans.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2737">Year after year, no matter how hard I tried, I missed the mark on my <a id="calibre_link-2738" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>dad’s gifts. Then one fall, I got mono (don’t ask). That year on November 4, I dragged my sick, lymph-swollen, pale body to the couch and told my dad, “This year for your birthday I only have the energy to watch Sunday football with you. I hope that’s okay.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2739">For the next four hours, we ate cheesy pretzels and chatted about team mascots. I finally learned how the whole yardage thing works. Sitting down to his birthday dinner, my dad clapped me on the back and said it was the best present I had ever given him.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2740">What the what? I watched a few football games and ate junk food&mdash;how could that have possibly been better than his own personalized scented candle collection? What I learned that day is that everyone has different ways of showing and feeling love.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2741">Dr. Gary Chapman has been helping couples as a marriage and family therapist for over fifty years. During the scope of his career, he began to notice patterns in the way couples showed (or didn’t show) affection toward each other. He found that there were five different ways people tended to express love&mdash;what he calls the 5 Love Languages. If you haven’t heard of these before, here’s the quick and dirty summary:<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-288" href="#calibre_link-131" class="calibre4 pcalibre">1</a></sup></p>
<ol id="calibre_link-2742" class="calibre9">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2743" value="1"><span class="strong">Words of Affirmation:</span> People with this love language express their care through spoken or written word&mdash;love letters, texts, and verbal expressions of love.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2744" value="2"><span class="strong">Gifts:</span> People with this love language express their care through small gifts or tokens of appreciation&mdash;jewelry, candy, or flowers.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2745" value="3"><span class="strong">Physical Touch:</span> People with this love language express their care through touch&mdash;hugs, cuddles, pats on the back, loving embraces.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2746" value="4"><span class="strong">Acts of Service:</span> People with this love language express their care by doing things for others&mdash;cooking their spouse dinner, running errands, or crafting something for them. (If you couldn’t tell from the story about my dad, this is mine.)</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2747" value="5"><span class="strong">Quality Time:</span> People with this love language express their care with their time. They want to simply be in the presence of the people they care about.</li>
</ol>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2748">Dr. Chapman argues that most relationship difficulties arise when we’re speaking different languages. For example, if a wife’s love language is Words of Affirmation, she lights up when her husband tells her he misses her. However, her husband’s love language is Physical Touch, so when he <a id="calibre_link-2749" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>gets home from work, he doesn’t want to talk, he just wants to snuggle with her on the couch. When she pulls away, he feels hurt, and when he doesn’t ask about her day, she feels stung. Over time, this eats away at the couple.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2750">Dr. Chapman worked with fellow psychologist Dr. Paul White to adapt the love languages for the professional environment. Their collaboration produced the five “appreciation languages.” Behavior hackers, take note.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-2751">JUST SAYING THANKS ISN’T ENOUGH</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2752">Feeling underappreciated eats away at employees who shoulder hard projects on their own, moms who aren’t thanked for cleaning up after kids, and friends who feel like they always end up hosting.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2753">Lack of appreciation is an especially pernicious problem in the workplace&mdash;and it’s often overlooked. In fact, 65 percent of Americans say they received no recognition in the workplace in the last year.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-289" href="#calibre_link-132" class="calibre4 pcalibre">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2754">When you ask managers why most employees leave their jobs, 88 percent of them believe <span class="strong">money</span> is at the root of most job turnover.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-290" href="#calibre_link-133" class="calibre4 pcalibre">3</a></sup> In fact, only 12 percent of employees leave for financial reasons. The other 88 percent boils down to job satisfaction.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2755">What makes someone love their job? That question is not so simple, but the Society for Human Resource Management feels that job satisfaction boils down to <span class="strong">employee recognition and engagement</span>.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-291" href="#calibre_link-134" class="calibre4 pcalibre">4</a></sup> However, one recent Gallup study found that almost <span class="strong">70 percent of US employees say they receive no praise or recognition in the workplace</span>.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-292" href="#calibre_link-135" class="calibre4 pcalibre">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2756">When we feel underappreciated we:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-2757" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2758">Are less productive</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2759">Have a harder time working on teams</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2760">Are less motivated</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2761">Feel more discouraged</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2762">Complain more</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2763">Have lower life satisfaction</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2764">Have lower job satisfaction</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2765">Appreciation is essential for a happy life, happy relationships, and a happy workplace. But it’s not that simple. As Dr. Chapman discovered, we each express and feel appreciation in different ways.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2766"><a id="calibre_link-2767" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>While filming my Master Your People Skills course, I had our studio audience members write love letters to someone important to them. As always with most of my activities, there was a catch. I told the students they had to write the letter with their nondominant hand. In a matter of minutes, all of the students were moaning of hand cramps and their letters were barely legible. <span class="strong">Asking someone to use their nonnatural appreciation language is like asking someone to write with their nondominant hand&mdash;it’s difficult, sloppy, and frequently causes misunderstandings.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2768">Until you learn how to hack the appreciation languages.</p>

<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-2772">HACK #8: THE APPRECIATION MATRIX</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2773">After a few years of using the matrix for personality traits, I found there was something missing. Solving someone’s five personality traits could only get me so far. I definitely could better understand and predict behavior, and casual conversations were easier, but it didn’t help with some of the deeper parts of connection.</p>
<div class="portrait_small" id="calibre_link-2774"><img src="images/000075.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-2775" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2776">When I found Dr. Chapman and Dr. White’s five appreciation languages, it clicked. The matrix isn’t a key to accessing a single piece of information; it is more like an onion. Each layer you uncover about someone reveals something new about how they operate.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2777">The first layer, as we already learned, is how someone falls on each of the five personality traits. The second layer is how someone expresses appreciation, and how they feel it.</p>

<p class="list_head" id="calibre_link-2801"><span class="strong"><a id="calibre_link-2802" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Answer Key:</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2803">Words of Affirmation: 1 and 6</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2804">Physical Touch: 2 and 7</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2805">Quality Time: 3 and 8</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2806">Acts of Service: 4 and 9</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2807">Gifts: 5 and 10</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2808">Your primary appreciation is: ___________________________</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented1" id="calibre_link-2809">Your secondary appreciation is: _________________________</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2810">You can write these into your matrix along with your personality rankings. I like to put the primary language on the top part of the circle and the secondary language on the bottom half.</p>
<div class="landscape_medium" id="calibre_link-2811"><img src="images/000076.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-2812" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2813">This information is not to be taken lightly. It has a huge impact on your overall happiness. When you know your appreciation language, you are able to:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-2814" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2815"><span class="strong">Know What to Ask For:</span> Your partner cannot read your mind. Neither can your boss, your friends, or your colleagues. Understanding your love language can help you know what to ask for when you need support. If your language is Words of Affirmation, you can ask your boss for more verbal feedback and plan catch-up meetings at the end of long weeks. If your language is Quality Time, you know that long-distance relationships or working virtually might not be a good choice for you. Set the people in your life up for success by telling them how you best feel appreciated by them.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2816"><span class="strong"><a id="calibre_link-2817" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Understand What’s Missing:</span> Whenever I teach the appreciation languages, the majority of my students have some kind of relationship aha moment. They realize that a fight they have been having with someone in their life has been caused by a difference in appreciation languages. For example, one of my students, Leila, whose primary appreciation language is Acts of Service, is constantly hosting her girlfriend for martini nights, cooking clubs, and brunches. Leila feels like she is the only one who ever does anything and has been feeling bad about the friendship. However, after this lesson, Leila realized her friend’s language is Words of Affirmation and always writes her long thank-you text messages and gushes about how much she loves these get-togethers. While this expression of appreciation doesn’t mean as much to Leila, she now knows what to ask for and where her friend is coming from.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2818">When you pair your appreciation language with your personality rankings, you’ll have doubly powerful insights. For example, if you are low open and your primary appreciation language is Quality Time, you would be better off asking a colleague to a monthly coffee date at your favorite place. If you are high open with Quality Time, you might ask your colleague to try a new coffee place once a month. <span class="strong">When you get to know yourself, you know what makes you happy, what to ask for, and how to have smooth interactions.</span></p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-2819">#2: Them</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2820">Now comes the fun part! I love to guess other people’s appreciation languages. It helps me understand how to make them happy and gauge what our relationship will be like.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2821">As with personality rankings, I always prefer a direct approach like this:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-2822" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2823"><span class="strong">As a Conversation Starter:</span> “Have you ever heard about the 5 Love Languages? I’m reading this book about it and was curious if you had heard of them.” Then you can get into a great conversation about which they think they are. I love to try to guess my friends’ and colleagues’ and have them guess mine.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2824"><span class="strong">Quiz:</span> We have a free appreciation language quiz on our website that you can send to a partner or friend and ask to share results. Find this at <a href="http://www.ScienceofPeople.com/toolbox" class="pcalibre calibre5">www.ScienceofPeople.com/toolbox</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2825"><a id="calibre_link-2826" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>If you don’t feel comfortable with the direct approach, you can use behavioral evidence to decode someone’s appreciation language.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-2827"><span class="bolditalic">What They Do For You</span></h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2828">The easiest way to know how someone likes to be treated is to see how they treat their favorite people.</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-2829" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2830">Do they love to come around your office and hang out together? (Quality Time)</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2831">Are they leaving little notes all over the house for you? (Words of Affirmation)</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2832">Do they touch your arm during conversations and hug instead of shaking hands? (Physical Touch)</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2833">Do they volunteer to make your favorite dessert for your birthday instead of ordering something premade? (Acts of Service)</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2834">Do they bring little trinkets home from their travels to give you? (Gifts)</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-2835"><span class="bolditalic">Discussion Questions</span></h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2836">Another decoding method is to ask about old memories, favorite stories, and recent experiences. These are some of my go-to questions:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-2837" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2838">What’s the nicest thing someone has ever done for you?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2839">How do you celebrate your successes?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2840">I really want to do something nice for our colleague who just had a new baby. What do you think we should do for them?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2841">What’s your favorite thing to do on the weekends?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2842">What’s the most interesting gift you have ever received? Given?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2843">What’s your favorite activity to do with your friends?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2844">Growing up, what did your parents do to celebrate your birthdays or your successes?</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2845">These questions can be surprisingly revealing. If you ask a non-gift-giver about the best gift they have ever given, they might tell you about something they <em class="calibre6">did</em> for someone else or a letter they <em class="calibre6">wrote</em> to someone else.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2846">I recently asked one of my friends this question. He said the best gift he ever gave was writing his grandmother’s life story in a handmade book for her. I instantly guessed his primary and secondary appreciation <a id="calibre_link-2847" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>languages&mdash;Words of Affirmation and Acts of Service. He was a great sport and agreed to confirm my guesses with my online quiz. Sure enough, those were his two.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-2848"><span class="bolditalic">Decoding Microexpressions</span></h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2849">Microexpressions can greatly help you in uncovering appreciation languages.</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-2850" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2851"><span class="strong">Anger:</span> Getting the wrong form of appreciation can be tiring or downright aggravating. For example, an employee who enjoys gifts might be disappointed at a grand office party thrown in his honor. Why? He didn’t want to burden his colleagues with a party. He would have been way happier with a gift card or that new snowboard he has been talking about.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2852"><span class="strong">Happiness:</span> A genuine happiness microexpression clues you in when you’ve truly delighted someone&mdash;whether they really like your idea, gift, or praise, or if you’re not speaking their appreciation language.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2853"><span class="strong">Contempt:</span> Contempt is a clue that someone feels disconnected from your method of appreciation. For example, someone who doesn’t like physical touch might betray a half smirk when you try to hug them.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2854"><span class="strong">Disgust:</span> Remember that disgust is the microexpression we show when we are trying to think of a polite way to say we don’t like something. Get someone a gift they don’t like or suggest a quality time experience that they are not into, and they will flash disgust before they answer.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2855">Spotting these microexpressions is only half the battle&mdash;how you respond is just as important. How can you use appreciation languages to get on the same page? That’s step #3.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-2856">#3: Us</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2857">Dr. John Gottman and Dr. Robert Levenson were looking for patterns in relationship happiness when they interviewed couples about their personal histories, arguments, and family life.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-294" href="#calibre_link-137" class="calibre4 pcalibre">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2858">At the end of these interviews, Dr. Levenson went back over the <a id="calibre_link-2859" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>transcript to see which pronouns each couple favored. <span class="strong">He found that the couples who used more “I, me, mine” had lower rates of relationship happiness and satisfaction than the couples who used more “we, our, us.”</span><sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-295" href="#calibre_link-138" class="calibre4 pcalibre">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2860">Dr. Gottman calls this pattern the we-ness versus me-ness mentality split. “Couples with a high degree of ‘we-ness’ emphasized their ability to communicate well with each other. They also emphasized unity and togetherness as well as having the same beliefs, values, and goals in life.” On the other side of the spectrum, couples who used more “me,” “I,” and “my” in their responses had self-oriented goals and long-term ideals. Not surprisingly, these couples were less happy in their marriages.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-296" href="#calibre_link-139" class="calibre4 pcalibre">9</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2861">While Gottman and Levenson were focused on romantic relationships, the same principle applies to all of our relationships. This is where the Appreciation Language hack can really help you level up. When you know the appreciation languages of people in your life, you switch into the “we-ness” mentality. You begin to think about how your needs are being met <em class="calibre6">and</em> how you can best meet theirs.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2862">Below are some ideas for how you might honor different appreciation languages in small ways that feel natural. For each language, write the name of someone in your life you suspect speaks it dominantly.</p>

<p class="eb01bodytextlinespace" id="calibre_link-2935">There is one thing I want to mention about physical touch in the workplace: <span class="strong">Proceed with caution</span>.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2936">From a nonverbal perspective, touch is wonderful for rapport, but you have to make sure you are keeping it appropriate. A good rule of thumb is to know that the farther up the arm you go, the more intimate the touch becomes. And the head and trunk are considered intimate zones.</p>

</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2954">Hopefully it goes without saying that with physical touch, it is important to follow your workplace etiquette. If you are unsure if your touch is welcome, pay attention to microexpressions as you move through the zones. For example, start with a handshake and see if you get a genuine <a id="calibre_link-2955" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>smile. Next time you meet, give a handshake and a shoulder touch&mdash;still smiling? Notice any contempt or anger? Finally, you can try the hug if you feel comfortable and they don’t show any negative facial gestures.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-2956">BONUS: DON’T BE BORING</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2957">Hey! I brought you a pen from my trip to Niagara Falls. We should hang out some time. Honey, I did the laundry.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2958">These are all nice, but they are also boring, predictable, and expected. In Hack #3: Conversational Sparks, I talked about escaping the average and creating dopamine with the unexpected. I want to challenge you to do the same for the Appreciation Language hack.</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-2959" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-2960">Don’t get Gifters standard presents&mdash;get them something personally meaningful.

As she builds ClientJoy boxes and handwrites thank-you notes (to cover those who also love Words of Affirmation), she remembers certain presents that rocked her world as a child. When her dad returned to their home in rural southwest Missouri after work trips, he’d bring her and her five siblings bizarre gifts, like XXL T-shirts from a canceled Disney show. “It didn’t matter. We were thrilled to get something,” she told me.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2993">Boyd Varty and his family own and operate Londolozi, one of the best luxury safari camps in South Africa, perennially ranked as one of the top one hundred hotels in the world. His guests have high expectations. Some expect the height of extravagance in the middle of the wild African bush. Some want to see the full cornucopia of wildlife Londolozi has to offer. Varty’s challenge is to understand his guest’s idea of a perfect vacation, and deliver it seamlessly. The only problem? Londolozi is located in one of the most dangerous and inhospitable private game reserves in South Africa.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2994">“I’ve also discovered that people have more phobias than you would ever imagine: buffaloes, worms, feathers, spiders, insects, loud noises, skulls, teeth, dung&mdash;any or all of which are very likely encountered on a game drive,” Varty wrote in his book <em class="calibre6">Cathedral of the Wild</em>.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-298" href="#calibre_link-141" class="calibre4 pcalibre">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2995">Over breakfast Varty told me about one particular guest that called on all of his experience.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-299" href="#calibre_link-142" class="calibre4 pcalibre">2</a></sup> Martin, an elderly British gentleman, had previously been on safari more than a dozen times in exotic locations around the world. He told Varty he had saved the best for last, and that this would be his final safari. Wanting to live up to the expectations of a safari aficionado, Varty decided he would personally take Martin on his game tour to ensure everything went according to plan. Unfortunately, Varty and Martin would both encounter an unpleasant surprise.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2996">On the second day of cruising around in an open-air Land Rover, Varty spotted some leopard tracks. He departed the vehicle on foot to investigate, leaving Martin in the safety of the vehicle until he returned. <a id="calibre_link-2997" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Martin hadn’t been alone for long when a huge male bull elephant came trotting out of the brush to inspect the vehicle&mdash;and Martin.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2998">Martin hoped the elephant would get bored and walk away so he remained as still and silent as possible. All of a sudden the two-way radio installed in the roofless Land Rover started crackling with traffic between other drivers on the property. The elephant became rattled and then agitated as the radio continued to blare. Soon the elephant began pounding his trunk on the hood of the Rover and started spraying it with dirt.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2999">Eventually the elephant stalked away, but when Varty returned he found Martin white-knuckled, ashen faced, and furious that he had been left to fend for himself in the face of a house-sized pachyderm. Martin bellowed from the back of the truck, “I’m very angry with you! Take me back to the camp!”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3000">For the next two days, Martin refused to talk to Varty&mdash;but insisted on completing his last few game drives. “I tried everything I could to win him back over the next couple of days, but he would have none of it,” said Varty.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3001">Then Varty had a fresh idea. Martin thought of himself as an adventurer. What if Varty could redefine his experience as a feat of daring? Calling in some favors, Varty asked all of the ladies in the camp to go up to Martin and congratulate him on being brave enough to stare down that big bull elephant all on his own. Bingo!</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3002">“In no time Martin began to feel like he was the main man, even to the point where he began to expound on the story to any person who walked past the bar. By the time he left Londolozi, he felt like the king of Africa,” said Varty. Martin told Varty at the end of the trip that his elephant encounter would be his greatest memory.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-300" href="#calibre_link-143" class="calibre4 pcalibre">3</a></sup><a id="calibre_link-428" class="footnote_link pcalibre" type="noteref" href="#calibre_link-144">fn1</a></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3003">Varty’s genius move was to tap into Martin’s ideals. I call this finding someone’s primary value.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3004">THE SCIENCE OF VALUE EXCHANGE</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3005">In Africa, I learned that animals give and take what they need to survive. Humans are not so different.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3006"><a id="calibre_link-3007" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Social psychologist Dr. Uriel G. Foa discovered the resource theory of human relationships.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-301" href="#calibre_link-145" class="calibre4 pcalibre">4</a></sup> <span class="strong">He argues that all interactions are actually transactions.</span> That people cooperate simply to give and take resources from each other. “A resource is defined as anything that can be transmitted from one person to another.”<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-302" href="#calibre_link-146" class="calibre4 pcalibre">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3008"><span class="strong">Special Note:</span> When I talk about “transactions” here, I’m not insinuating that all intimate relationships are actually cold and businesslike. Many transactions are aimed toward finding people who truly fulfill us and building relationships that are mutually beneficial.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3009">Resources include physical items like money and food as well as emotional resources like love, advice, and status. As humans, we need both kinds of resources to survive and thrive.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-303" href="#calibre_link-147" class="calibre4 pcalibre">6</a></sup> Foa and his research team proposed that each of us have a hierarchy of six needs that originate in our childhood. If these needs are met, we are able to grow up, gain independence, and feel secure in our surroundings and relationships:</p>
<div class="landscape_large1" id="calibre_link-3010"><img src="images/000079.gif" alt="image" id="calibre_link-3011" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3012">In the Give column, put a check mark next to the resources you think you give frequently. In the Take column, put a check mark next to the resources you think you take frequently.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3013">We both <em class="calibre6">give</em> each of these resources and <em class="calibre6">take</em> them during interactions. For example, we might buy a friend lunch to ask for their advice (giving Money and taking Information). Or we might give a colleague praise after they help us finish a project on time (giving Status and taking Service).</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3014">We need all six of these resources, but we typically take what we need <a id="calibre_link-3015" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>more of and give what we have in abundance. Looking at your selections, is this true for you?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3016">Occasionally, especially with the nonphysical resources like Love, Service, and Information, <span class="strong">we give what we most want</span>. We might crave Love, so we give it to everyone around us&mdash;even if they don’t deserve it. Or we might desire to be in the know, so we gossip in hopes of people telling us more. Does this ring true for you?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3017">This exchange of resources is a core dynamic of every relationship. Misunderstandings here can cause needless tension, even breakups. Here’s why:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-3018" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3019"><span class="strong">Power:</span> Foa argues that power can be measured as the amount of resources you have to give others. Having a lot of Money is obviously an element of power, but having a lot of Love to give others is also an element of power.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3020"><span class="strong">Needs:</span> We can use resource theory to better meet people’s needs. If you need to motivate a colleague, for example, you’d best consider whether they value Information&mdash;learning, applying new job skills, and maybe even insider knowledge&mdash;or Status&mdash;getting respect, a high title, and esteem from peers&mdash;or whether they’re just in it for the Money&mdash;a higher salary, bonuses, and financial incentives.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3021"><span class="strong">Security:</span> Relationships become more difficult when there’s consistently an unequal exchange of resources. Anxiety, guilt, and resentment bubble up. We all know a romantic relationship is doomed when one person gives more Love and begins to feel resentful. Meanwhile, the person doing all the taking might feel smothered. You can even understand workplace tensions in these terms: When a factory foreman gives the resource of Money to her employees, she expects employees to give back the Goods they make in the factory. If the boss doesn’t pay enough, employees get angry. If employees don’t produce enough, the foreman gets angry.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3022">Whether we are in personal or professional environments, establishing equilibrium in our relationships is essential. However, other people’s resource needs might not always be what you expect.</p>

<blockquote id="calibre_link-3025" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-3026">One day, a man was walking down the street with his eight-year-old daughter. They turned a corner and saw a little boy sitting next to a large wicker basket. He held a sign that said, “Puppies 4 Sale.”</p>
<p class="eb21extrafeatureindentednbs" id="calibre_link-3027">Before the man could stop his daughter, she ran up to the basket and clutched a tiny dog to her chest. “Oh dear, I’m in trouble,” he thought.</p>
<p class="eb21extrafeatureindentednbs" id="calibre_link-3028">He turned to the boy, “Son, how much does this puppy cost?”</p>
<p class="eb21extrafeatureindentednbs" id="calibre_link-3029">“Well, sir, this puppy is the best, most adorable puppy in the entire world. He costs one thousand dollars,” the little boy replied.</p>
<p class="eb21extrafeatureindentednbs" id="calibre_link-3030">“One thousand dollars!” the man exclaimed. “That’s crazy! Now, be reasonable and give me a better price and I’ll buy this puppy from you.”</p>
<p class="eb21extrafeatureindentednbs" id="calibre_link-3031">“Sorry, sir, this puppy is the best in the world. It is one thousand dollars,” the boy said.</p>
<p class="eb21extrafeatureindentednbs" id="calibre_link-3032">The man haggled with the boy for another twenty minutes, but he wouldn’t budge on the price. The man decided he would have a much better negotiating position if he came back without his daughter, who was crying hysterically.</p>
<p class="eb21extrafeatureindentednbs" id="calibre_link-3033">The next day, the man returned without his daughter, and sure enough, the boy was still sitting with his wicker basket and a napping puppy inside. The man said, “Well, well, well, looks like no one has taken you up on your offer of one thousand dollars for that puppy. Now that you have had a day to think about it, can you cut me a better deal?”</p>
<p class="eb21extrafeatureindentednbs" id="calibre_link-3034">“No, sir, the puppy is still one thousand dollars because it is the best puppy in the entire world,” the boy said.</p>
<p class="eb21extrafeatureindentednbs" id="calibre_link-3035">After another ten minutes of negotiations, the man left empty-handed. A few weeks later, the man saw the boy playing basketball with his friends on the local playground. He called over, “Hey, kid! Did you ever sell that puppy?”</p>
<p class="eb21extrafeatureindentednbs" id="calibre_link-3036">The boy trotted over. “I sure did!” he said.</p>
<p class="eb21extrafeatureindentednbs" id="calibre_link-3037">The man was surprised. “Really? Did you sell it for one thousand dollars?”</p>
<p class="eb21extrafeatureindentednbs" id="calibre_link-3038"><a id="calibre_link-3039" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>“Yes!” he replied. “A girl traded me two five-hundred-dollar kitties.”<sup class="ebsup1"><a id="calibre_link-304" href="#calibre_link-148" class="calibre4 pcalibre">7</a></sup></p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3040">This parable demonstrates that <span class="strong">value is in the eye of the beholder</span>.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3041">We typically think of valuable assets in terms of their monetary value, but there are other, more subjective currencies. To the little boy, two five-hundred-dollar kitties were much more valuable than ten hundred-dollar bills. Which leads me to this simple and intuitive hack: When you know what drives someone, interactions become much easier.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3055">A few years ago, I was conducting an experiment in our lab called Fifty Shades of Awkward. I was hoping to research where, why, and how awkwardness is caused in our social interactions.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3056">The setup was simple. We recruited one hundred participants&mdash;fifty men and fifty women from all over the country and of varying ages&mdash;to keep “social diaries.” For seven days, the participants jotted down brief summaries of their social interactions in a simple chart:</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3087">We wanted the diaries to be done on the go, so they had only enough room for essential pieces of information. In the first column, participants entered a brief description of the event. We wanted to know if it was romantic, professional, familial, or social. The second column asked for a single symbol:</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3088">“+” means it was an overall good experience.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3089">“=” means it was only ok.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3090">“-” means it was an overall negative experience.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3091">The final column, “Description,” recorded the feelings that popped up during interactions. A participant might write, “Fun! Met lots of people” or “Super awkward, didn’t know anyone.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3092">At the end of the seven days, our researchers coded the diaries for patterns. We were looking for syntax changes, feeling repetitions, and word usage after each type of event. We then compared these notes to each participant’s Big Five personality traits.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3093">It was quite easy to predict extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism based on a participant’s notes. Openness was <a id="calibre_link-3094" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>the only pesky one we found harder to detect. But the most interesting part of this experiment was the discovery of people’s primary values.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3095">Until this experiment, my matrix had only two layers&mdash;personality and appreciation language. This research added the final layer. We noticed that each person’s notes focused on one resource, whether to complain about its absence or to extol its presence. It was as if participants were looking to gain something from each of their social interactions. If they got it, it was a positive interaction. If they didn’t get it, it was a negative interaction.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3118">Have you ever played <em class="calibre6">Super Mario Bros.</em>? According to my nonscientific, completely personal, emotion-based fact-finding mission, this is the best video game of all time.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3119">In it, Mario runs, flies, and leaps through the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Toadstool from the enemy known as Bowser. Mario has to collect coins, special bricks, and rare items throughout each level. Coins make him richer. Red and yellow Super Mushrooms make him bigger. Some secret bricks give him special powers. Fireballs protect him against enemies like Goombas and Koopa Troopa shells.</p>

<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3123"><span class="strong">Filling a Missing Need:</span> Foa and his team argue that we often try to seek from others what we have been denied earlier in life. For example, someone who didn’t grow up in a loving household may seek Love, validation, and belonging from their friends and colleagues later in life. They might become people pleasers in their desperation to feel liked. Or someone who grew up short on Money might cut coupons and haggle over a few cents at garage sales even after they have plenty to pay the bills. It’s hard to feel sated when the memory of resource deprivation is old and ingrained.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3124"><span class="strong">Finding What We Lack:</span> We also tend to seek out what we can’t provide ourselves. If someone has low self-esteem, they are more likely to seek the Status resource from others. We all know someone who incessantly posts selfies on social media. They need likes, comments, and shares to feel good about themselves.</li>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3187">There’s a reason your value language belongs right at the heart of the matrix.

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3188">Want to know why you’re in a funk? Your primary value isn’t being met. Want to know why a relationship isn’t working for you?

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3189">Many of my students say that decoding their own matrix was just as <a id="calibre_link-3190" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>powerful as learning how to decode others’. <span class="strong">Our primary value is at the heart of who we are, the choices we make, and what drives us.</span></p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-3191">#2: Them</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3192">Here’s a nice, fat human behavior truth for you: <span class="strong">Most people’s choices make sense to them.</span> When they don’t make sense to you, it’s usually because you are being driven by a different primary value.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3193">Knowing primary value differences with the people in your life can help explain:</p>
<ol id="calibre_link-3194" class="calibre9">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3195" value="1">Why some people drive you absolutely crazy</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3196" value="2">Most relationship misunderstandings</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3197" value="3">Unpredictable choices and behavior from the people you care about</li>
</ol>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3198">Do you need to motivate someone at work? Tap into what they value. Do you need to understand a partner’s baffling choice? Figure out how it met their value needs. Want to know what gets someone up in the morning? Decode their primary value.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3199">Killer social skills require seeing the world through someone’s lens besides your own. <span class="strong">Appeal to someone by focusing on what they value, not what you value.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3200">Be warned: I think uncovering someone’s value language is the most difficult layer of the matrix. I use three tactics:</p>
<ol id="calibre_link-3201" class="calibre9">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3202" value="1"><span class="strong">Complaints and Brags:</span> Does someone complain about not being paid enough at work? (Money) Not being recognized for an achievement? (Status) Not having a nice enough car? (Goods) Or do they brag about how they took care of a sick parent? (Service) How much the new boss likes them? (Love) How much they know about the new corporate partner? (Information) We’re usually proud of obtaining our primary resource and upset about not having enough of it. This comes out in boasts, grumbles, and brags.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3203" value="2"><span class="strong">Nonverbal Cues:</span> Body language can also help you figure out if you are tapping into or refusing someone’s primary value. Think of our good friend Mario. When he gets a Fire Flower or Super Mushroom, he jumps into the air, gets bigger, or runs faster. But when he hits a Koopa shell or a Goomba, he shrinks or loses a life. It’s the <a id="calibre_link-3204" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>same in real life (minus the overalls and mustache). When someone gets a primary value met, they are delighted! Watch for genuine happiness microexpressions, leans, nods, and winner body language. When someone does not get their primary value met, they show disgust, anger, contempt, or defeated body language.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3205" value="3"><span class="strong">Behavioral Cues:</span> Once you start looking for it, someone’s behavior can tell you a lot about needs they are trying to fill. Here is how this might look in the workplace:
<ul class="squ1" id="calibre_link-3206">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3207">Colleague A always stays late to suck up to the boss. You can tell they’re constantly looking for praise or more responsibility. Their primary value might be Status.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3208">Colleague B leaves promptly every day at five p.m., but always gets their projects done in time for the raise review. They are the first to ask about year-end bonuses. Their primary value might be Money.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3209">Colleague C is an office butterfly, making friends with colleagues and leaving supportive notes on people’s desks. Their primary value might be Love.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3210">Colleague D always remembers people’s birthdays, loves to plan office parties, and always organizes the corporate softball team. Their primary value might be Service.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3211">Colleague E desperately wants the corner office and the best parking space in the lot. They love all the corporate perks and never forget to bring everyone souvenirs from vacations. Their primary value might be Goods.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3212">Colleague F is a bit of an office gossip, so they always know what’s going on behind the scenes. They also play golf with all the partners. Their primary value might be Information.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3213" value="4"><span class="strong">Worries:</span> What keeps someone up at night? What do they stress out about? This can clue you into their primary value. Do you have a friend who is constantly moaning about feeling out of the loop? Her primary value might be Information. Do you have a colleague who freaks out over people’s titles and is always stressing about who will get the next promotion? His primary value might be Status.
<ul class="squ1" id="calibre_link-3214">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3215">Listen to the kinds of things someone worries about.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3216">Ask them what they worry about or the biggest worries in their life.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3217">Match it with a primary value.</li>
</ul></li></ol>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3220">We asked over 1,000 participants what they worry about&mdash;the answers are very evenly distributed. Why? Our unique primary values inform our different kinds of worries.</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3223"><a id="calibre_link-3224" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>These can be hard to pick up on at first, but analyzing someone’s past behavior can help point you in the right direction toward their primary value.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3225"><span class="strong">Special Note:</span> I love the direct approach, but primary values are hard to talk about honestly. Most people who are driven by Money are ashamed to admit it&mdash;even though this is a legit and necessary resource. Others feel embarrassed to say that they need to be liked or please people. Be aware that what someone says about their value language might not match the way they actually behave.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-3226">#3: Us</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3227">Once you think you know someone’s primary value language, what do you do with that information?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3228">First, your predictions about their future behavior and choices will improve. This is extremely helpful when trying to decide how a colleague will perform on a new project or if someone would be a good potential romantic partner.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3229">Second, you can use it to motivate the people in your life. Want to encourage your child to do more chores? More allowance might not be the best option. Want to impress your boss? Support their primary value, <a id="calibre_link-3230" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>not yours, with the behavior <em class="calibre6">they</em> will appreciate. Want to incentivize your teammate to do better? Give more of what they value and take less of what matters most to them.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3231">Lastly, you can adopt a primary value to help people feel worthy. I think the greatest gift we can give our fellow human beings is to meet their resource needs. If I can give someone more of their primary value, I always do.</p>

<p class="eb29bodytextindentlinespace" id="calibre_link-3279">The best way to harness the power of primary values is to give the right resource right away. For example, one of my good friends, John Boylston, ran for state representative in Oregon. He reached out to a mutual friend of ours, Matthew Scott, about a campaign coordinator opening. (Thank you to both of them for letting me use this example.)</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3280">John wanted Matt’s help, but was also hoping to make it a win-win <a id="calibre_link-3281" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>interaction. I have a hunch John’s professional primary value is Service. He needed help with coordinating his entire campaign&mdash;calling donors, making fliers, knocking on doors, and answering phones.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3282">Before reaching out to Matt, John had to figure out Matt’s primary value. Was Matt’s primary value Money&mdash;would he want to get paid hourly? Was it Status? Did Matt want to be listed on his website and campaign materials? Was it Information? Would Matt want to get an insider’s view into politics? After talking to a few friends in our circle, John found out that Matt had been wanting to get experience running a political campaign. Guessing that Matt’s primary value was Information, here’s how John reached out via e-mail (edited slightly for length):</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-3283" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-3284">Hi Matt,</p>
<p class="eb22extrafeaturefirst" id="calibre_link-3285">I heard that you were thinking about getting more involved in politics and potentially helping out on a campaign, is that right?</p>
<p class="eb22extrafeaturefirst" id="calibre_link-3286">If so, I think you would be an awesome fit for a project that I’m working on. This spring I am going to run for state representative for House District 26. When I run I will need a good campaign team around me. I have already gathered a team of professional consultants, fundraisers, a data manager, and compliance and accounting individuals. What I really need, though, is someone who can be director of voter contact and volunteer manager.</p>
<p class="eb22extrafeaturefirst" id="calibre_link-3287">This is more than the entry-level volunteer position and I think it could be a chance for you to get inside a campaign and really see how campaigns work while also getting to make decisions, be creative, and do more than stuff envelopes (though we will have to pitch in on that stuff from time to time).</p>
<p class="eb22extrafeaturefirst" id="calibre_link-3288">I would be able to guide you through this, and we have an awesome team coming together who will help as well. So, we will have tons of support for you, but I need someone who can be the engine for the campaign when it comes to making sure that we’re actually talking with voters.</p>
<p class="eb22extrafeaturefirst" id="calibre_link-3289">As I was setting up my team, you were the first person I thought of for this job and I think you would be awesome at it.</p>
<p class="eb22extrafeaturefirst" id="calibre_link-3290">&mdash;John</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3291"><a id="calibre_link-3292" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Later, I learned that Matt was ecstatic to get this e-mail from John. It was exactly what he had been wanting. He replied right away:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-3293" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-3294">I’d absolutely love to help out in any way, shape, or form and this sounds like something that I’d be very interested in for sure. I believe my weekends and nights are usually fairly calm, with the exception of I’m out at a trade show, so those times would work great for me. Thank you so much for thinking of me for this position and I’d love to help out. When would be a good time for you to meet so we could talk through everything? Once again, thank you so much!</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3295">To put this in perspective, <span class="strong">Matt thanked John for asking him to work for free</span>. At first glance this seems counterintuitive, but if you know that Matt’s primary value is Information, it makes sense. Matt wanted to know more about running a campaign and was happy to join for an insider’s look. This e-mail was the start of a powerful working relationship because both men had their primary values being met.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3296"><span class="strong">Special Note:</span> Some of my students have found the need to occasionally add a situational value. This is when someone’s primary value is different in a specific situation. For example, you might know that a colleague’s primary value is Money. However, you notice that projects where he takes the lead, he craves praise, recognition, and likes to claim credit: a situational value of Status.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-3297">The Hunt for the Heart</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3298">One of Boyd Varty’s biggest challenges arrived when a king decided to visit Londolozi. “We’ve had our share of visiting celebrities, dignitaries, and politicians … but handling this royal entourage would require an unprecedented level of coordination,” recalled Varty.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-306" href="#calibre_link-150" class="calibre4 pcalibre">9</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3299">Not only did major logistics have to be taken care of&mdash;like extending a small runway to accommodate royal jets&mdash;but Varty had to figure out what would make His Highness’s experience special.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3300">Luckily, Varty and his team got their clue right away&mdash;Goods seemed paramount to the king and his entourage. By talking to the king’s staff, Varty learned that the princesses enjoyed shopping. “Our small gift shop had to be hugely overstocked so that the royal retinue of twenty women accompanying the king could discover fresh merchandise should they choose to shop once, twice, or three times a day.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3301"><a id="calibre_link-3302" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>The Varty team flew in the king’s Clarins face wash, his favorite vibrating workout machine, and papaya hand lotion. By the day of the king’s arrival, Londolozi had been totally customized to his primary value.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3303">Aside from the natural beauty of their surroundings, this basic human insight is how Boyd Varty and his family have turned Londolozi into a world-renowned resort. Varty taps into primary values every day, with every person he meets&mdash;whether a safari guide, front desk concierge, or cook. He can quickly discern whether someone is on safari for the luxury experience (Service), the all-inclusive five-star dining (Goods), or a sense of oneness with nature (Love).</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3304">At the end of the day, Boyd is hunting for heart. He is searching for ways to bring meaning to the people who come to Londolozi. Your goal as a hacker is to do the same thing. Hunt for people’s values, hunt to give them meaning, hunt for heart.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3332">On May 18, 1926, Aimee Semple McPherson went missing.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3333">The day started off quite normally. McPherson and her secretary went for a swim near Venice Beach. Only a few minutes after diving into the water, McPherson disappeared. Searchers combed the nearby beaches. The city of Los Angeles went on high alert. Nothing.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3334">Then something odd happened. All over the country, people began reporting sightings of McPherson&mdash;impossible sightings. Several would come in on the same day, thousands of miles apart. The police received ransom notes from a variety of sources.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3335">No one could find McPherson, yet everyone could find her. And then, a month after her disappearance, McPherson emerged unharmed from the Mexican desert, claiming she had been kidnapped and held hostage in a shack.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3336">The media was quick to point out that some aspects of McPherson’s story did not add up. (How did she get to Mexico? Why was she unharmed? Who kidnapped her?) The public was enthralled. When she arrived in Los Angeles, over 30,000 people greeted her as a hero at the train station.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3337">McPherson fanned the flames of fame and funneled her new followers into the Angelus Temple&mdash;a church that still runs in Los Angeles today. At one point, 10 percent of Los Angelenos were members at McPherson’s temple.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-308" href="#calibre_link-153" class="calibre4 pcalibre">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3338">“And that’s why I want to fake my own kidnapping and start a cult,” said Nicol Paone. The comedian is standing on top of a double-decker bus outside the Angelus Temple, speaking to a rapt group of tourists. The Angelus Temple is only one of many bizarre and hilarious stops on Paone’s alternative comedy show, <em class="calibre6">The Last Show I Do Before I Go on Medication.</em><sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-309" href="#calibre_link-154" class="calibre4 pcalibre">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3339"><a id="calibre_link-3340" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>The concept behind the tour is personal, telling of her life in Los Angeles&mdash;the breakups, the walks of shame, the drunken stumblings. At one point during the show, Paone pulls the giant bus up in front of her ex-girlfriend’s house and leads the entire bus in singing a rendition of Adele’s song “Hello” as loud as possible. “Occasionally my ex pops her head out of a window and sings with us … it depends on what kind of mood she is in,” explained Paone.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3341">In between stops, Paone ducks tree branches, gives quirky tidbits about Hollywood murders, and points out hidden hangouts. At a particularly long red light, Paone encourages riders to “Get out your phones, post a picture of me on your Instagram, and then hook me up with your most successful friend.” After her fourteenth tour or so, she figured out which blocks to avoid and how to effectively catcall pedestrians.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3342">Paone never imagined her tour would become a local Hollywood highlight, that she would have a waitlist for shows, or that she’d be approached by TV executives about turning her bus tour into a series. She’d originally assumed the show would be a onetime thing. “My life was failing. I had no money, no job, and my girlfriend and I had just broken up,” she explained. So she turned comedy into her therapist, and used the bus as her exposure therapy.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3343">Her very first show was a terrifying experience. “I basically screamed at everyone for an hour and a half and felt like throwing up every time we got to a new location.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3344">But she forced herself to be honest. Stories of botched dates, relationship shenanigans, and ridiculous encounters poured out. “I was sharing my deepest secrets and shameful moments. It was both frightening and freeing,” said Paone.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-310" href="#calibre_link-155" class="calibre4 pcalibre">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3345">The next day, while Paone was dealing with what she calls her “vulnerability hangover,” people began to talk about the show, and especially about Paone’s raw humor and openness. Since then, Paone has done over twenty live bus shows. Every single one sells out.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3346">When Paone speaks, people not only listen&mdash;they beg to hear more. Paone accidentally stumbled upon the ultimate shortcut to connection. <span class="strong">She is a storyteller.</span></p>

<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3350"><a id="calibre_link-3351" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>THE SCIENCE OF STORIES</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3352">After a lifetime of failed business ideas, toymaker Ty Warner emptied his savings and mortgaged his home, convinced he had an idea worth betting it all on.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3353">It was a radical twist on the sweet, fluffy stuffed animal he’d seen a million times.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3354">He decided that his stuffed animals would come with a name, a birthday, and a story. There was Pinchers the Lobster, born June 19, 1993. He came with a story, too, and it went like this:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-3355" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-3356">This lobster loves to pinch</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-3357">Eating his food inch by inch</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-3358">Balancing carefully with his tail</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-3359">Moving forward slow as a snail!</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3360">And there was Chocolate the Moose and Squealer the Pig and Splash the Whale. Finally Ty Warner created something that flew off the shelves. Kids didn’t want just one Beanie Baby&mdash;they wanted every single one. At its peak, Beanie Babies pulled in over $700 million in one year.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-311" href="#calibre_link-156" class="calibre4 pcalibre">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3361">Warner understood that we feel connected to someone (or something) when we hear their story.</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-3362" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3363">Stories give us a chance to say “me too,” activating the similarity attraction effect.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3364">Stories create conversation sparks&mdash;they give us pleasure when we listen.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3365">Stories help bond storytellers to story listeners.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3366">Researchers Greg Stephens, Lauren Silbert, and Uri Hasson wanted to know what happens in our brains as we listen to stories. They put participants in fMRI machines and recorded the brain activity of two people&mdash;one person sharing a story and one person listening to the story. What they saw was striking&mdash;the two brains began to “sync” up. As the speaker told a story, the listener’s brain patterns began to match.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-312" href="#calibre_link-157" class="calibre4 pcalibre">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3367"><a id="calibre_link-3368" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Spanish researchers even found that reading words like “perfume” or “coffee” lights up our primary olfactory cortex, where we process smell. If you hear a story about a creamy crème brûlée, your brain pictures the crème brûlée, imagines the taste, and conjures up the sweet smell and smooth feeling on your tongue. Even though you do not have the crème brûlée in front of you, your brain responds as if you do. Imagining a sensory experience activates the same part of your brain as the real experience would. And when someone tells you a story, your brain acts as if you were present in the story. Researchers call this neural coupling. I call it connection hacking.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3369">This cognitive mechanism makes stories the perfect shortcut to connection. Stories help us literally get on the same wavelength as the people we are with. They not only listen to what we are saying but also <em class="calibre6">experience</em> what we are saying. <span class="strong">Even simple stories rev up brain activity and sync us up with the people around us.</span></p>

<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3373">STORY HACKER</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3374">Confession: You know those people who call you during dinner and ask for money? I used to be one. I was that person you hung up on. Yes, I used to be a telemarketer. Well, not quite a telemarketer, but close. To make extra money in college, I worked at the Emory Telefund. Every night for three years, I called Emory alumni and asked them to donate to their alma mater.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3375">This was the worst and best job I ever had. It forced me to get out of my comfort zone, bond with people quickly, and become numb to the word “no.” Most importantly, it taught me the ultimate connection hack: telling stories.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3376">The first few weeks on the job were the hardest. On the first night, you sit down at a large bank of computers and plug your headset into an autodial system. As the call connects, you have five to seven seconds to speed-read the contact card that pops up on your screen and quickly memorize any relevant details about the caller. I typically aimed to recall <a id="calibre_link-3377" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>their name, graduation year, and major. If you were lucky, you got four to five rings to memorize the data. And then:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-3378" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-3379">“Hello?”</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-3380">“Hi, Mr. Smith. I’m calling from the Emory University Telefund. I would like to ask you about making a donation&mdash;” <em class="calibre6">Click.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3381">A click wasn’t as bad as some of the more expletive-filled alternatives. If you managed to keep someone on the line, you had to quickly, and in my case, awkwardly, ask for a small donation to the school. In my first two hundred calls, I was lucky to keep one, maybe two people on the line. Getting donations from those two people, well, let’s just say, I wasn’t earning my keep.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3382">Finally, one night a manager took pity on my abysmal numbers and constant hang-ups. He came over, unplugged my headset, and said simply, “Do you love Emory?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3383">“Yes, of course! That’s why I’m here trying to raise money for us.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3384">“Okay, great,” he said. “Why do you love Emory?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3385">This was easy: “Well, I love Emory because I think it has some of the best teachers in the country, it has an amazing community, and the campus is beautiful …”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3386">“Stop,” he interrupted me. “That’s how I want you to approach these calls. You love Emory, these alumni love Emory. Just tell them stories about that.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3387">My manager was right. It didn’t matter that these alumni had graduated fifty years ago, or that we had different majors, or that we lived in different areas of the country. We had stories to share.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3388">From that point on, I approached my calls with two goals. In the first part of the call, all I wanted to do was share a story about Emory&mdash;maybe about homecoming weekend, the new gym, or a fun professor prank on campus. I didn’t realize it then, but this first story was <span class="strong">aligning</span> the alumni and me.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3389">In the second part of the call, my goal was to get them to tell me a story. I wanted to hear about their time at Emory&mdash;what had changed, whether they had been back for a visit, or what their favorite moment at the school was. In the end, if they donated, great. If not, that was okay, too. My single goal was to hunt for stories.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3390"><a id="calibre_link-3391" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Slowly, as my stories got better, my calls got better, too.</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-3392" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-3393">“Hello?”</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-3394">“Hi, Mr. Smith, my name is Vanessa and I am a sophomore at Emory University. I was wondering if you had a few minutes to reminisce about Emory?”</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-3395">“A sophomore, huh? How is our football team doing these days?”</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-3396">“Great, sir, still undefeated.” (Emory doesn’t have a football team, so this is a campus-wide inside joke.) “Actually, this past weekend was homecoming, and we had a giant float made of Georgia peaches. Did you do that for homecoming back in 1978?”</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-3397">“Oh goodness, let’s see. I think we had a parade, but we had water balloons back in those days.”</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-3398">“No way! We would get in huge trouble if we had water balloons on campus today. You know how they are about the flower beds.”</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-3399">“Ha, yes, I remember how angry the gardeners got when we played soccer on the lawn! Well, what can I help you with, young lady?”</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-3400">“Yes sir, I am calling from Emory Telefund. Last year you gave a very generous donation of one hundred dollars, and I was wondering if you would be willing to make a donation of $150. I can also mark it especially for the history department, since that was your major.”</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-3401">“You can do that? Well, that would be great. And please say hi to Mr. Talbott if he is still there.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3402">Not only did the donations start rolling in, but I began to <em class="calibre6">love</em> my job. I learned about hidden nooks in the library, I got tips on how to game the housing lottery system, and I learned so much about my fellow alumni. Every week, I would save stories to tell on my calls and think of new ways to ask for stories. I became a story hunter and a story hacker. And now you can, too.</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3410">The easiest way to harness the power of stories is to have a Story Stack with your favorite anecdotes, narratives, and follow-up questions all in one place, ready to use. Here’s how it works:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-3411" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3412"><span class="strong">Trigger Topic:</span> You know how the same subjects tend to come up over and over again in conversations? I call these trigger topics. When chatting over drinks or meeting new people, we constantly hear about the weather, traffic, weekend plans, and latest TV shows. These are commonly talked about, safe, generic areas. These are the first level in your Story Stack. When you hear a trigger topic, you can use it as a launching pad to tell your stories. Take a look at the list below and add any topics that frequently come up in your conversations.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3413"><span class="strong">Sparking Stories:</span> We have stories about everything, but we very rarely stop to take stock of them. Sparking stories are those anecdotes that produce laughter, ahas, groans, and great follow-up conversation. Use the prompts below to hunt for at least one story for each trigger topic.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3414"><span class="strong">Boomerang:</span> After you are done telling a story, you always want to bring the conversation back around to the other person you are speaking with. They can then answer and send it back to you. I call this throwing a boomerang&mdash;at the end of your story, how can you tie the idea back to them? What question can you ask to hunt for their stories? How can you get them talking? Or how can you make them laugh?</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3415"><a id="calibre_link-3416" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Let me give you an example of how this works before you begin on your own Story Stack. Let’s say I am at a business lunch and someone brings up the latest comedy special on HBO. Comedy is one of my trigger topics. I wait to see if there will be a lull in the conversation and then bring out a story from my stack. It goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-3417" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-3418"><small class="calibre14">COLLEAGUE:</small> I just finished the Aziz Ansari HBO special. So good.</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-3419"><small class="calibre14">ME:</small> Yeah, I could spend a whole weekend watching comedy specials on Netflix. I used to watch Bill Maher all the time, but after I humiliated myself in front of him, I could never watch him the same way again.</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-3420"><small class="calibre14">COLLEAGUE:</small> What?! What do you mean?</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-3421"><small class="calibre14">ME:</small> One time, my husband and I were waiting in a crowded parking lot in West Hollywood after a movie. It was freezing and the attendant was taking forever to bring us our car. All of a sudden, I see this giant black SUV roll up into the lot, and the attendants wave it right to the front. My husband and I immediately start wondering out loud whose car it might be. We joked that the rims weren’t cool enough to be a rapper and the license wasn’t short enough to be a politician. Right as we began to riff on the leather seats, I turn to see Bill Maher standing there giving us death stares. Yes, it was his car and yes, he heard the whole exchange. It was so awkward!</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-3422"><small class="calibre14">COLLEAGUE:</small> Oh no! That’s so embarrassing! Did he laugh or was he serious?</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-3423"><small class="calibre14">ME:</small> He didn’t even crack a smile, so I felt really bad. Anyway, have you ever seen a celebrity in real life?</p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturehang" id="calibre_link-3424"><small class="calibre14">COLLEAGUE:</small> Oh yeah! This one time …</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3425">I used a story to bond with my colleague and hack what could have been a predictably boring conversation. Then I threw a boomerang to get him telling me a story.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3426">Now, it’s your turn. Fill out the Story Stack below with as many trigger topics, sparking stories, and boomerangs as you can think of.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3427"><span class="strong">Remember:</span> Your stories don’t have to be originals. Heard a funny story at work? Add it to your stack. Read a funny anecdote in this book? Add it to your stack.</p>
<div class="calibre10"></div><div class="image_full" id="calibre_link-3428"><a id="calibre_link-3429" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a><img src="images/000083.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-3430" class="calibre15" /></div><div class="calibre10"></div>

<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3434">THE ART OF STORYTELLING</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3435">Having a great Story Stack isn’t much good if you’re not a great storyteller. Three simple elements differentiate an okay story from an awesome one:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-3436" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3437"><span class="strong">Start with a Hook:</span> You have to grab attention from the start. A hook is a provocative question, stimulating statement, or open-ended idea to pique interest. I started my Bill Maher story with the hook, “I used to watch Bill Maher all the time, but after I humiliated myself in front of him, I could never watch him the same way again.” Invariably, this hook gets people curious.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3438"><span class="strong"><a id="calibre_link-3439" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Champion a Struggle:</span> The best stories have at their center some kind of a struggle. A question, a problem to be solved, or a challenge to be overcome. In the Bill Maher story, the struggle was “Who’s in the car?” Or think of it as creating suspense. Can you hint at something? Are you facing off against someone else? Is there a punch line on the way?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3440"><span class="strong">Utilize Provocative Words:</span> Remember how the brain’s olfactory system lights up when it hears the words “perfume” and “coffee”? The more descriptive your story, the more your listeners’ brains will light up. Spice up your story by adding expressive, interesting words.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3441">You can use all three of these elements in under two minutes&mdash;and you <em class="calibre6">should</em> keep your story short. After three minutes you become a conversation hog.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3442">Once you start using this model, it becomes easy to turn a boring anecdote into a laugh-worthy story. The author Susan Cain used this structure to get over 14 million views on her TED Talk on introversion.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-313" href="#calibre_link-158" class="calibre4 pcalibre">6</a></sup> She used the hook, struggle, and boomerang format to captivate her audience.</p>
<ul class="none1" id="calibre_link-3443">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3444"><span class="strong">Hook</span>: When I was nine years old, I went off to summer camp for the first time. And my mother packed me a suitcase full of books, which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do. Because in my family, reading was the primary group activity.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3445"><span class="strong">Struggle:</span> And this might sound antisocial to you, but for us it was really just a different way of being social. You have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you, but you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland inside your own mind. And I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this, but better.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3446"><span class="strong">Unique Words:</span> I had a vision of ten girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns. But camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol. And on the very first day, our counselor gathered us all together and taught us a cheer that she said we’d be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit. And it went like this: “R-O-W-D-I-E, that’s the way we spell rowdie. Rowdie, rowdie, let’s get rowdie.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3447"><span class="strong"><a id="calibre_link-3448" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Boomerang:</span> Yeah. So I couldn’t figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy, or why we had to spell this word incorrectly.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3449">Cain could have told this same story in a boring way by simply saying:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-3450" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-3451">Even though many people see reading as antisocial, for me, it was a family activity. When I went to camp, it was incredibly hard to find my place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3452">Instead, she added elements to get people hooked to her struggle. And her boomerang was getting the audience to laugh&mdash;which is the best kind of boomerang in front of a large group.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3453">Having trouble thinking about how to fit your own stories into this structure? No worries! I’ve got you covered. I created a fill-in-the-blank game for you to practice. The trigger topic here is “Commuting.” Sound boring? No way, we are going to turn it into a mini-story using the formula above. Just fill in the blanks:</p>
<ol id="calibre_link-3454" class="calibre9">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3455" value="1">Hook: You want to know the most ______ I ever saw while driving?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3456" value="2">Struggle: I was driving down the road and all of a sudden, I look over and see ___.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3457" value="3">Unique Words: And it was so ___!</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3458" value="4">Boomerang: Have you ever seen someone do something ______ in their car?</li>
</ol>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3459">Let’s try this again with the trigger topic “Fascinating People.” This one can be a bit longer. Think of a person you were very excited to meet&mdash;this can be anyone you were excited to meet at any time in your life.</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-3460" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3461">Hook: One time, _____ years ago, I encountered one of the coolest people I have ever met.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3462">Struggle: It might sound _____, but I had always wanted to meet _____ because _____. Beforehand, I was so _____. Finally, the moment came.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3463"><a id="calibre_link-3464" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Unique Words: And it was _____! What surprised me most about meeting them was ________. I’ll never forget _____.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3465">Boomerang: Who is the coolest person you have ever met?</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3466">Practice this formula with the middle column “Sparking Story” in your Story Stack above. Go through your Story Stack and see if you can think of hooks and struggles for each anecdote.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3467">Another fun way to hear casual stories in action is by watching sitcoms&mdash;this is how I learned to tell short, witty stories. Sitcom writers have to condense character-building stories into funny anecdotes. The TV sitcom <em class="calibre6">How I Met Your Mother</em> has dozens of examples of this. In the pilot, Ted asks Robin, “What do you do?” (Trigger Topic) and she says:</p>
<ul class="none1" id="calibre_link-3468">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3469">I’m a reporter for Metro News One … well kinda a reporter” (Hook)</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3470">I do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news you know like “monkey who can play the ukulele.” I am hoping to get some bigger stories soon.” (Struggle)</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3471">A few minutes later he asks her about her future plans (Trigger Topic).</p>
<ul class="none1" id="calibre_link-3472">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3473">Ted: “Hey, you want to have dinner with me on Saturday night?”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3474">Robin: “Oh, I can’t, I’m going to Orlando for a week on Friday. (Hook)</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3475">Some guy is attempting to make the world’s biggest pancake. (Struggle)</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3476">Guess who’s covering it. (Boomerang)</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3477">Notice these mini-stories all have a bit of humor in them. Humor often comes from something unexpected or surprising. Don’t be shy about testing your jokes on different audiences. Just practice telling your story and see when and where you get laughs and smiles.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3478">Use audience feedback to make adjustments to the stories in your stack. Don’t be afraid to play around with nonverbal emphases, pauses, and embellishments as you practice telling your stories.<a id="calibre_link-430" class="footnote_link pcalibre" type="noteref" href="#calibre_link-159">fn1</a></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3479">One of my favorite classrooms for learning the art of storytelling? The <em class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3480" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>New York Times</em>. Award-winning journalists, editors, and writers help make the <em class="calibre6">New York Times</em> a world-renowned news agency. And we can learn from them.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3481">One of my researchers, Robby Smith, and I designed a small experiment to analyze the types of <em class="calibre6">New York Times</em> articles that go viral. Over the course of four months from October 2015 to January 2016, Robby logged and coded all of their most-read pieces. He analyzed the topics of each article, the format of the titles, headlines, and the promise of each article.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3482">We were particularly interested in the promise of an article. What does the title suggest the article will offer? In other words, if the reader clicks on it, what will it give them? A new outcome? A lesson? A surprise? An update? Here are the categories we used:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-3483" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3484"><span class="strong">Question:</span> For instance, the article titled “Can You Get Smarter?” from October 2015.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3485"><span class="strong">How to:</span> Many headlines suggested tips, self-help, or a way of doing something new. “What You Can Do about Climate Change” was the title of an article from December 2015.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3486"><span class="strong">History:</span> Other titles referenced a time, period, or moment in history, such as “The Hard-Working Italian Origins of the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree” from December 2015.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3487"><span class="strong">Snark:</span> This category included any headline that had a clever, funny, or punny title. We all laughed when we came across “This Column Is Gluten-Free.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3488"><span class="strong">New:</span> For example, “Everything You Need to Know about the New SAT” came out in October 2015.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3489"><span class="strong">Story:</span> Well-crafted headlines can imply you’re on the brink of reading a great story about a person or place. “My Dark California Dream” or “Lady Gaga and the Life of Passion” are two examples.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3490">Thirty-five percent of the articles on the viral list promised a story&mdash;195 out of 559 total articles&mdash;making it by far the most effective category.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-314" href="#calibre_link-160" class="calibre4 pcalibre">7</a></sup></p>
<div class="landscape_large1" id="calibre_link-3491"><img src="images/000085.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-3492" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3493"><a id="calibre_link-3494" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Take a look at the most e-mailed article list on the <em class="calibre6">New York Times</em> website for yourself. You’ll see how the same storytelling formula comes up over and over again. First, the writers hook you with the slightest hint of a story in their title. Then, they quickly introduce a struggle or challenge that needs to be solved, and finally, they paint a picture with attention-grabbing words.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3495">Whether you want your pitch to go viral, your e-mail to be read, or people to like your status updates, hook people with the power of stories.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3496">REALITY BITES</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3497">You can use your Story Stack and the three-step storytelling technique in person, in e-mails, and even in your profiles.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3498">Every week, we send out a free Science of People insights e-mail to over 100,000 subscribers. It’s filled with cool people science, human behavior hacks, and communication tips. I once sent out a link to one of our articles called, “Why Couples Fight.” Instead of just plopping the link in the e-mail, I decided to include a short story about my husband and me. It went like this:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-3499" class="calibre8">

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3510">This e-mail had a far higher open rate and click-through rate than average. Why? Yes, I told a story, but I was also being real. I told an honest story about my real husband and something we really fight about. In fact, my husband even texted me that he thought he really did forget to pick up his socks that morning.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3511">Comedian Nicol Paone is popular for her bitingly real stories. They’re funny, they’re heart-wrenching, and most importantly, they connect us to her.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3512">“I think in some ways people relate to my stories. Sure, they laugh, but they also can imagine being in that same spot themselves. Maybe they made a similar mistake,” says Paone. “There is connection through failure. When you hear someone else’s failure you are less judgmental of your own,” she added.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3513">The best stories are the ones that share both failures and successes. Don’t be afraid to share something a little embarrassing, a little vulnerable, a little scary. These are the stories that build the best connection.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3532">You would think Mark Gordon’s illustrious career as a film producer is enough for a lifetime. He’s won Oscars and Emmys. He’s worked with Hollywood’s top celebrities, from Tom Hanks to Matt Damon to Sandra Bullock. But he’s also a hero&mdash;albeit unsung&mdash;in the world of education.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3533">Gordon first took on increasing responsibilities in the private schools his two daughters attended. Then he became chairman of Teach For America Los Angeles. Then, in 2010, Gordon had an idea&mdash;and it wasn’t a small one. He wanted to create a school that shaped kids into global citizens. This was a tremendous undertaking&mdash;especially coming from someone who knew little about schools. Would the leadership skills he’d developed on movie sets translate into this new setting?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3534">When I sat down with Mark Gordon, he summed up his leadership approach in three steps: “I always start with something I am passionate about, outline one goal, and then find a really smart, capable person to work with.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3535">The passion was there. And a daunting goal was set: Open a charter school by September 2010. This would give him nine months to find a location, form an education charter, hire teachers, enroll students, and create a curriculum.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3536">The third part of the equation was Kriste Dragon. Gordon met Dragon while she was executive director of Teach For America. As a Juris Doctor, former math teacher, and mom of three, Dragon had the right experience and perspective.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3537">“I called her and told her: I want to start a school and I’ll pay for the <a id="calibre_link-3538" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>whole thing. How do we do it and how do we do it fast?” recalled Gordon. Instead of being overwhelmed, Dragon was hooked immediately. “My mom was an immigrant and my dad grew up in the projects outside of Birmingham, Alabama, so diversity and inclusion have always been something that mattered to me,” said Dragon.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3539">The duo hammered out a mission together: “We hoped to create a tuition-free school that was incredibly racially, economically, and intellectually diverse. We also wanted to foster sophisticated thinkers who have a deep sense of service,” said Dragon.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3540">Within a few weeks, Citizens of the World Charter School was born. But they had just a few months to get the school ready for kids. Eager to shield her from the work of drawing donations or forming committees, Gordon encouraged Dragon to use her talents. “I told her to build a team, find her ideal location, and tell me exactly what she needed,” said Gordon.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3541">Dragon internalized Gordon’s philosophy in her own hiring process. “Get the right people, connect them to something bigger than themselves, and let them do their thing,” said Dragon. She found the right principal, assembled an outstanding teaching team, and located the perfect spot for their flagship location in East Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3542">When Citizens of the World Charter School opened up applications for their fall class, they received hundreds of applicants and had a full class starting in September 2010.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3543">“The reason we were able to do so much, so quickly was due to Mark’s leadership style. He is very clear on the goal, he knows my skills, and he lets me run with them. I couldn’t ask for a better partner&mdash;he gives me the resources I need to solve problems and the freedom to solve them my way,” explained Dragon.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-316" href="#calibre_link-162" class="calibre4 pcalibre">1</a></sup><a id="calibre_link-432" class="footnote_link pcalibre" type="noteref" href="#calibre_link-163">fn1</a></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3544">In 2012, Gordon and Dragon opened their second school in the Silver Lake neighborhood in California. Just a year later, they launched their third school in Mar Vista, and expanded to Brooklyn, New York, where two schools (in Crown Heights and Williamsburg) opened. Citizens of the World now has seven schools, serving over 1,850 students across three cities.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3545">Slowly, Citizens of the World schools are empowering the next generation of leaders. And Gordon is a testament to the fact that if you are a leader <a id="calibre_link-3546" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>in one area, you are a leader in every area. His approach to people works whether he is influencing the film industry or the education system.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3547">Gordon and Dragon are changing the world by empowering people. Now you can, too.</p>

<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3551">THE SCIENCE OF OWNERSHIP</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3552">Have you ever tried to build something from Ikea? If you’re like me, here’s what happens: First, you see a great-looking item in a perfectly designed room on the floor of Ikea. You fall in love! You snap a pic of the tag&mdash;because you’ll never remember the bizarre-sounding name&mdash;and burn 1,000 calories pushing a giant flatbed cart around stacks of identical-looking aisles. Once you have procured all twenty-seven pieces of wood for your item, you proceed to the checkout. You stop for a cinnamon roll.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3553">Once you get home, you unload and unpack all twenty-seven pieces of wood onto your living room floor. The amount of discarded cardboard is staggering. You make small piles of nails, screws, himejababs, and plastic nubs. (I don’t know what a himejabab is, but it is what I call the tiny weird things Ikea gives you to build furniture.)</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3554">You are delighted to see only four pages of instructions&mdash;and there are pictures! Forty-five minutes into your assembly, you realize your starting piece is upside down. You throw it across the room. You get a glass of water and yell at your spouse. Five and a half hours later, your item is finished&mdash;wobbly, but finished.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3555">Over the next few months, you watch as it slowly begins to disintegrate and then collapse when used or nudged. A friend suggests buying a new (preassembled) item from the store down the street. You are horrified&mdash;you invested eight hours of your life for this item, it will crumble into dust before you get rid of it.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3556">This delightful little experience is universal. We place a disproportionately high value on self-made products. And it is appropriately called the Ikea effect. Researchers Michael Norton, Daniel Mochon, and Dan <a id="calibre_link-3557" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Ariely wanted to investigate this interesting phenomenon around ownership.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3558">They asked participants (builders) to make a small origami frog or crane. Then the researchers offered to buy their handmade creations from them, and asked how much of their own money the participants might pay for such an item.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3559">The researchers then showed the origami to new non-builder participants and asked how much <em class="calibre6">they</em> would pay for it&mdash;they wanted to know how far above market price builders would pay for their own creations.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3560">Finally, the researchers had expert origami makers create perfect cranes and frogs, and asked a final group of non-builder participants how much they would pay.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3561">As you might have guessed, “While the non-builders saw the amateurish creations as nearly worthless crumpled paper [worth less than 5 cents], our builders imbued their origami with more value [23 cents],” said the researchers.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3562">The researchers also tested this using actual Ikea furniture and Lego creations&mdash;with the same results.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-317" href="#calibre_link-164" class="calibre4 pcalibre">2</a></sup> We love things that we have made because we see them as an extension of ourselves. This means we place a higher value on them.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3563">We can leverage this effect to empower those around us. Mark Gordon didn’t call Kriste Dragon and say, “Hey, I want to start a school and I want to do it my way.” From the beginning, he wanted Dragon to create a school with him. He gave her the financing and the support she needed, and then stepped back. <span class="strong">When we give up control, we gift power.</span></p>

<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3572"><a id="calibre_link-3573" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>EMOTIONAL OWNERSHIP</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3574">Have you heard of the famous study about copy machines? It goes like this: In 1977, psychologist Ellen Langer at Harvard University wanted to hack the copy machine line.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3575">Langer had her research assistants try to cut to the front of the copy machine line using three different lines:</p>
<ul class="none1" id="calibre_link-3576">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3577"><span class="strong">Request #1:</span> “Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the copy machine?” (Request Only)</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3578"><span class="strong">Request #2:</span> “Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the copy machine because I’m in a rush?” (Request + Logical Reason)</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3579"><span class="strong">Request #3:</span> “Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make copies?” (Request + Silly Reason)</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3580">Request #2 is the only request that makes any sense. Request #1 is nonsensical because the line is clearly to use the copy machine. Request #3 is also ridiculous&mdash;everyone in the line has to make copies.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3581">The first request worked okay&mdash;60 percent of people let the researcher cut in line. The second two requests worked incredibly well. The logical reason persuaded 94 percent of people to move aside, and the silly reason got 93 percent of people to say yes!<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-318" href="#calibre_link-165" class="calibre4 pcalibre">3</a></sup></p>
<div class="landscape_large1" id="calibre_link-3582"><img src="images/000086.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-3583" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3584"><a id="calibre_link-3585" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Why are reasons&mdash;even illogical ones&mdash;so powerful? Humans are purpose-driven creatures. We want to believe there are reasons behind everything we do. <span class="strong">Before leaders can inspire action, they have to get emotional buy-in.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3586">When we explain the motivations behind a goal, it allows listeners to feel partial ownership of that goal. Have you ever donated to a charity? Were you initially arrested by an emotional plea? Charities typically open a pitch by sharing their mission with you. Take my favorite nonprofit Kiva as an example. This is the first paragraph of the “About us” page on their website:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-3587" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-3588">We are a nonprofit organization with a mission to connect people through lending to alleviate poverty. Leveraging the internet and a worldwide network of microfinance institutions, Kiva lets individuals lend as little as $25 to help create opportunity around the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3589">Kiva wants you to know there is a purpose behind their actions, and they hope that their purpose will become your purpose.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3590">If it sounds like getting emotional buy-in might be hard, I have an easy trick for you:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-3591" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturecenter" id="calibre_link-3592"><span class="strong">Always use the word “because” when asking for something.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3593">“Because” implies purpose. Whether you are pitching yourself, trying to get a date, or convincing a friend to choose your favorite restaurant for dinner, you always want to have your why at the ready.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3594">We know from the copy machine example that even ridiculous reasons can successfully persuade people, but I want you to find powerful whys, like Mark Gordon’s passion for changing the future of education or Kiva’s goal of alleviating poverty. Here is how you can give your “because” more impact.</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-3595" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3596"><span class="strong">Tie to Them:</span> The best “because” benefits the listener. What’s the payoff? What’s the end result? What’s the advantage? Think of L’Oréal’s slogan, “Because I’m Worth It,” which appeals directly to the customer’s needs.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3597"><span class="strong">Tie to You:</span> If something means a lot to you, or would make you incredibly happy, harness that authentic passion to create a <a id="calibre_link-3598" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>powerful “because.” Gordon believes fervently in equality and diversity. He also has two young daughters whom he wants the best for. Even if those aren’t your own goals, hearing him speak is powerfully moving. Or think of the United States Marine Corps slogan, “The Few. The Proud. The Marines,” which shows what the marines stand for and their elite mission.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3599"><span class="strong">Tie to Us:</span> You can also tie your “because” to a mutual benefit, or the way something could help an entire community. When pitching Citizens of the World Charter Schools, Gordon underscores how raising future world leaders will make the world better for everyone. Of course, the schools help students and their families most directly, but they also benefit the world they will enter after graduation. Similarly, Apple’s “Think Different” slogan is an appeal to both the user and the world to challenge the status quo.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3600">Always share a because, and when you can, tie it to as many emotional appeals as possible. You might even be able to check all three boxes. For example, in my online course The Power of Happiness I give three whys for people to buy&mdash;you will be happier, I will be able to fund more research on happiness, and we will all live in a more fulfilled and aware community.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3601">Here’s how everyday requests could be improved by this hack:</p>
<ul class="none1" id="calibre_link-3602">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3603"><span class="strong">Typical Request:</span> We would love to have you as a customer.</li>

<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3610"><span class="strong"><a id="calibre_link-3611" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Hacker Ask:</span> Are there any aisle seats available on this flight, because I tend to get up a lot and don’t want to disturb the people around me?</li>
<li class="eb23listfirst" id="calibre_link-3612"><span class="strong">Typical Ask:</span> Would you mind helping with my résumé?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3613"><span class="strong">Hacker Ask:</span> Would you mind helping with my résumé? Because I am hoping to finally move out of my parents’ house, and your help would mean the world to me!</li>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3614">Knowing your why starts with being <span class="strong">mission driven</span>. Simon Sinek calls it the “start with why” approach in his book of the same name. Kriste Dragon hires only teachers who believe in the Citizens of the World Schools mission. Mark Gordon works only on projects where he can tell a powerful story. Even when they’re action movies, Gordon said, “They are <em class="calibre6">about</em> something.

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3644"><span class="strong">Bottom Line:</span> Give people emotional ownership over ideas, goals, and projects.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3645">SKILL OWNERSHIP</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3646">When Mark Gordon was creating the Showtime series <em class="calibre6">Ray Donovan</em>, he partnered with Emmy Award&ndash;winning writer Ann Biderman as the showrunner. “Ann Biderman and I worked very closely to develop the script together. She was incredibly collaborative. It was one of the most joyous experiences that I’ve had developing a piece of material,” said Gordon in an interview with <em class="calibre6">Fast Company</em>.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-320" href="#calibre_link-167" class="calibre4 pcalibre">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3647">Gordon knows how important it is to know not only your own skill set, but also the skills of the people you are working with. “I only work with people whose talent I have tremendous respect for. That way, when you are working with them they have as much of a chance of being right as you and you produce something really good,” explained Gordon.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3648">After working with Biderman on casting and the pilot, Gordon knew it was his time to step back and let Biderman run the show. “Once you’re on a clear path, my involvement is less, because she doesn’t need it. I look at cuts and share my thoughts, but we’re sailing smoothly,” said Gordon. In other words, <span class="strong">let the right person use their skills and then step back.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3649">I call this process “skill ownership.” Every time someone uses their talents to accomplish part of a goal, they feel more ownership over that goal&mdash;and this makes them want to achieve it even more.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3650">Say you’re in your best friend’s bridal party. The bride and groom&mdash;let’s call them Rachel and Brian&mdash;have asked you to spearhead pre-wedding activities and logistics for the bridesmaids and groomsmen. The wedding planner hands you a long list of items that need to get done, from grabbing ice for the rehearsal dinner to putting the flowers in water before the wedding.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3651">The first step is to give everyone emotional ownership. You assemble everyone in the hotel suite and introduce yourself. “It’s so nice to finally meet all of you! The wedding planner just gave me a list of some things we could all help out with <span class="strong">because</span> Rachel and Brian are a little overwhelmed. I know <span class="strong">our goal</span> is to make this wedding as smooth as possible <a id="calibre_link-3652" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>for the bride and groom and get everything done so we can party up at the wedding.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3653">This ties in the goal (getting the list done) with both helping the couple and ensuring a good time for everyone on the wedding night. People nod and go around introducing themselves&mdash;great! You have everyone on board.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3654">Next, you want to turn that emotional buy-in into action. Here’s what most people do, which doesn’t work:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-3655" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3656">Can someone finish the table name cards? … Anyone, anyone?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3657">Who can go pick up the ice before the rehearsal dinner? … Please? Someone?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3658">Who wants to assemble these frames and hang them? … Come on, guys! We all have to pitch in!</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3659">Splitting up tasks this way is not the best way to encourage action. People might grudgingly say yes, but it will be like pulling teeth.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3660">Instead of randomly delegating or hoping people will self-select, you want to divide the list by skills. <span class="strong">This highlights people’s abilities so they feel capable, as opposed to burdened.</span> To do this, use what I call Skill Solicitation. Skill Solicitation is when you ask people to self-identify based on capability:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-3661" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3662">Is anyone good at _____?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3663">Do you know anything about _____?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3664">I need someone who is strong with ______.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3665">For the wedding, it might go like this:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-3666" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3667">Does anyone have nice handwriting? Great! Susie, would you mind finishing up the table name cards?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3668">Does anyone have a car here? Wonderful! Steve, would you mind picking up the ice before the rehearsal dinner tomorrow?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3669">I need someone who is really handy&mdash;anyone good at fixing things? Thank you so much, Greg. Will you assemble and hang these picture frames?</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3670">This is not only a faster way to delegate, but it also lets tasks be skill oriented as opposed to duty oriented. Use this tactic on corporate teams, <a id="calibre_link-3671" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>sports teams, with kids, with friends, and with family. Direct invitations can be as effective as open questions. For example, Mark Gordon knew Kriste Dragon had the right skill set, so he called her and asked her to use those specific skills to achieve his mission. Some other examples:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-3672" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3673">Uncle Jim, you are so good at mixing cocktails&mdash;can you man the bar tonight?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3674">Rene, I know you are very good at nailing those cold calls&mdash;can you tackle this list tomorrow?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3675">Julie, you always pick the best restaurants&mdash;do you want to plan the birthday dinner?</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3676">Do you notice something else about these examples? They also secretly use Hack #4: The Highlighter. Skill Solicitation is a great way to emphasize someone’s strengths and use them toward a common goal.</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3679">I have a postcard on my desk that says:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-3680" class="calibre8">

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3682">Micromanaging kills leadership. The best leaders know when to give up control. They also know that the more power they can give people over <em class="calibre6">how</em> something gets done, the better they will be able to get it done. No one does this better than Mark Gordon.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3683">“For me the hardest part was learning that there’s something between being 100% engaged in something and not being engaged at all …. I learned to be where I’m needed when I’m needed,” said Gordon.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3684">Leadership is not about doing or overseeing everything in a project. It is about getting involved in the right things and letting the right people handle the rest. “Real learning experience for me, to be able to know when to come in, and when to leave people alone,” explained Gordon.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-321" href="#calibre_link-168" class="calibre4 pcalibre">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3685">“Shonda Rhimes doesn’t need me every day helping her make <em class="calibre6">Grey’s Anatomy</em>. You can’t feel the need to just go over there and mess around <a id="calibre_link-3686" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>with stuff either because you can, or because you feel guilty, or because it’s expected of you,” said Gordon.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3687">This approach has been astoundingly fruitful for both Gordon and Rhimes. <em class="calibre6">Grey’s Anatomy</em>, one of the most popular shows on television, has received 174 nominations and has won 63 awards including Golden Globes and Emmys. Rhimes herself has won a Producers Guild award, a GLAAD Media Award, two Writers Guild awards and five NAACP awards. She has also gone on to be the showrunner for <em class="calibre6">Private Practice</em> and <em class="calibre6">Scandal</em> and executive producer for <em class="calibre6">How to Get Away with Murder</em>. <span class="strong">When you give up control, you let other people take ownership, and everyone wins.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3688">Now, I am not saying you should give up total control. Rather, I want you to think about how you can allow people to add their own flair. Researchers found that consumers are willing to pay a premium for products that they have customized.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-322" href="#calibre_link-169" class="calibre4 pcalibre">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3689">Kiva does an amazing job incorporating this ownership into their business. As discussed previously, Kiva is an organization that allows people to give interest-free microloans to entrepreneurs around the world. But they don’t just ask you to give money so they can dole it out as they see fit. Instead, they let you search a database of entrepreneurs so <em class="calibre6">you</em> can decide exactly where your loan goes and how it will be used.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3690">I donate to Kiva every year on my birthday, and I <em class="calibre6">love</em> the process of picking my entrepreneurs. Kiva uses the three steps of Own It! in their donation model:</p>

<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3692">First, when I go to their website, I see a list of people I can “lend” to. Every person starts off with their why&mdash;to get emotional ownership. I see a loan to a bookstore in Guatemala will help them purchase a computer for logging sales. Or that Fatima in Lebanon will use her loan to buy more merchandise for her retail shop.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3693">Then I get to use my skills and values. Female entrepreneurship is incredibly important to me, and entrepreneurship happens to be a talent of mine, so I tend to give to women-owned businesses. I enjoy reading the different revenue models and picking women I think have sturdy business plans.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3694">Last, I decide exactly how much of my loan goes to each entrepreneur. Talk about customization!</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3695"><a id="calibre_link-3696" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>The more you can allow people to customize a process or implement their own strategy, the better their participation will be. Christine Day, CEO of Lululemon Athletica, didn’t realize this until she was neck-deep in the business of running a company. “I was a very bright, smart executive, but I think I majored in being right.” She realized that “being right” wasn’t the best way to motivate a team.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3697">Day began to create spaces for employees to brainstorm and come up with their own solutions instead of being told what to do by upper management. “When I was trying to get other people to have ownership or engagement, it wasn’t about the telling, <span class="strong">it was about letting other people come in to the idea and being purpose led</span>,” said Day.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-323" href="#calibre_link-170" class="calibre4 pcalibre">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3698">Day wanted to create jobs where people were utilizing their skills and taking ownership of the company’s performance. And she believes this is the crux of her leadership ability: “That was so powerful for me to shift from having the best idea or problem solving into actually being the best leader of people.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3699">Under Day’s leadership, Lululemon went from having 71 stores to 174, and took their revenue from $297 million to almost $1 billion.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-324" href="#calibre_link-171" class="calibre4 pcalibre">9</a></sup> Being a good leader is not about micromanaging&mdash;it is about empowering your team by letting them customize their work.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3721"><em class="calibre6">Over 80 percent of respondents believe that leaders are made, not born. I agree&mdash;anyone can be a leader with the right tools.</em></p>

<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3723">BONUS: PASSION OWNERSHIP</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3724">When Gordon began working on <em class="calibre6">Saving Private Ryan</em>, he did it because he loved the idea&mdash;not because he thought it would make a lot of money.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3725">“<em class="calibre6">Saving Private Ryan</em> was a movie that was purely from my heart and that I worked on for a long time with Bob Rodat, the writer. And we were fortunate enough to have Steven [Spielberg] and Tom [Hanks] jump on <a id="calibre_link-3726" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>board. But that was not necessarily expected to be a big commercial movie, so when you can make something of it that is truly meaningful <em class="calibre6">and</em> it’s a commercial success, that’s the best thing of all,” said Gordon.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3727">Gordon always hopes his movies will be big blockbuster successes, but they don’t have to be. “Movies like <em class="calibre6">The Details</em>, which we just finished and premiered in Sundance … and some of the other smaller pictures that we’ve done are all about love of film, and things that I just fall in love with. And those films have to be in a category where we say, <em class="calibre6">It’s not about the money on any level</em>. It’s all about feeling good about making something that we’re in love with. Very few people have the opportunity to do that, and I’m very grateful for that,” said Gordon.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3728">Gordon’s success comes from the fact that he works only on projects he cares about. When he sits down to write a script, he begins with a subject he is fascinated by and explores it.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3729">“The thing for me is: Am I emotionally engaged in the idea? Is there something special about it? Does it capture my imagination? So everything that I do is simply something that turns me on,” explained Gordon in an interview with the <em class="calibre6">Hollywood Reporter</em>.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-325" href="#calibre_link-172" class="calibre4 pcalibre">10</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3730">If something captivates your imagination, your passion, your energy, it is much more likely to captivate the imagination, passion, and energy of others. And isn’t that what we are all here to do? I believe <em class="calibre6">everyone</em> is a leader in some way.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3750">Frank Warren is a keeper of secrets.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3751">Every week, strangers send him postcards divulging confessions they’ve been bottling up. In total, Warren has received over a million secrets, and every week he receives one thousand more. The flow is so constant that the walls of his house are lined with stacks of secrets.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3752">Some of the secrets are funny. Like this one, which I’m sure you can relate to:</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3768">Warren gets secrets about infidelity, depression, parenting, office politics, repressed fantasies, and friendships.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3769">Warren never expected to be the landing pad for all of these truths. It all started in 2004. “I printed up three thousand postcards with my home address. On each postcard, I asked people to anonymously share a secret,” said Warren. He handed them out on the streets of Washington, DC. He posted them on bulletin boards in coffee shops, he hid them in books in the public library, and he left them in bathroom stalls.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3770">When I asked Warren about his expectations, he was not optimistic. “I had no idea if anyone would actually send me any back. I was going to be really happy if I got 365 back over the course of a year,” Warren told me. He didn’t have to wait for long. Within a few weeks, he had one hundred postcards. Fascinated by what people would share to a stranger, he turned them into an art exhibit. Eventually he began posting them on his blog, which he calls <em class="calibre6">PostSecret</em>. Over the course of a few years, the blog went viral.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3771">When I first stumbled upon <em class="calibre6">PostSecret,</em> I spent hours scrolling through people’s secrets. I completely understood the attraction of a blog about secrets&mdash;we all like to read other people’s confessions. But why would anyone submit them?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3772">Then I sent Warren my own secret postcard. And it all made sense. Secrets are about releasing a vulnerability. When we share them&mdash;even with strangers&mdash;we get relief. We feel less alone.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3773">“Every day, we make a decision about what to reveal and what to <a id="calibre_link-3774" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>conceal about who we are,” explained Warren. “Those decisions affect what we talk about, who we talk to&mdash;and can weigh us down.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3775">A few years into <em class="calibre6">PostSecret</em>, Warren created an in-person event where he asked audience members to share secrets&mdash;live. “I was worried that it would be a total fail. That the anonymity of the blog is what gave the secrets power,” said Warren. But he didn’t need to worry.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3776">At one university event, a professor came up to the microphone and admitted, “I have been stoned for every single lecture this semester.” The shocked crowd embraced her. “The audience is on an emotional roller coaster, too. Everyone is incredibly supportive. Sometimes we can’t support the secret, but we can support the courage of sharing it,” explained Warren.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3777">The live events draw hundreds and sometimes thousands of people to share and hear confessions. “People bond incredibly fast at these events. It’s as if secrets are the door to connection people have been looking for,” said Warren. When he signs books, he often notices people in line forming friendships and collecting each other’s contact information. The secrets act as a catalyst for turning strangers into fast friends.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3778">He has tapped into something I call the vulnerability effect. “Sharing our most vulnerable stories is a courageous act that channels intimacy with others and builds lasting relationships,” said Warren.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3779">Revealing, as opposed to concealing, not only brings us relief, it also brings relief to the people who we reveal to. “People often find that when they let their secret go, they hadn’t been keeping it to begin with. Their secret had actually been keeping them,” said Warren. As humans, we can’t help but feel bogged down by what we perceive as our limitations and failings. So we try to hide them. We hold back from connecting with people for fear that they might see our ugly parts and judge us. What we don’t realize is that <span class="strong">our secrets don’t have to prevent connection&mdash;they can encourage it.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3780">Warren is in a unique position to see the patterns in our most private worries. Want to know what secret Warren gets most frequently? “By far, the most common postcard we get is: I pee in the shower,” said Warren. “The second most common secret we get has to do with belonging. Someone trying to find a community, someone shunned from their community&mdash;it seems everyone is trying to find someone or a group where they don’t have to have any secrets at all,” said Warren.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-327" href="#calibre_link-174" class="calibre4 pcalibre">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3781"><a id="calibre_link-3782" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Reading through thousands of submissions from unrelated strangers, Warren kept seeing the same narrative: We want to belong, and to be accepted for who we are. Here’s the funny thing: <span class="strong">We are afraid that our secrets will cause people to not accept us. But oftentimes, sharing our secrets is the fastest way to find acceptance.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3783">Now, before we go on, let me be very clear on something. The goal of this chapter is not to get you to confess your secrets to anyone who will listen. That would be both terrifying and weird. Instead, you don’t have to feel weighed down by secrets in your interactions. This hack will teach you to leverage your vulnerability to elevate your relationships.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3784">SECRET SCIENCE</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3785">Think back to the last time you had a zit.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3786">Did you venture out into the world praying no one would notice the volcano about to erupt on your chin? When talking to people, were you petrified that the only thing they would notice was the giant red bump on your face? Did you become convinced that everyone was talking about it?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3787">We always feel our vulnerabilities are painfully obvious. That people are scrutinizing us at every turn. That our blemishes define us. I hate to break it to you, but no one really cares&mdash;and I mean that in the nicest way possible.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3788">Our mistakes are not noticed nearly as much as we think. This cognitive bias is called the spotlight effect. In one study, researchers Thomas Gilovich and Victoria Medvec at Cornell University decided to humiliate students for the sake of science.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-328" href="#calibre_link-175" class="calibre4 pcalibre">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3789">First, researchers asked students to put on a Barry Manilow T-shirt&mdash;chosen for its high level of potential embarrassment. Then they asked each student to estimate the percent of people who would notice their Manilow T-shirt in a crowded classroom. The students made fairly high guesses, thinking most other students would notice (and probably make fun of the Manilow shirt). And then finally, they asked the students to walk into a classroom and join fellow students taking a survey. The results? The T-shirt-wearing participants grossly overpredicted how many students would notice. The estimates were twice as high as the actual number.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3790">The researchers concluded:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-3791" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-3792"><a id="calibre_link-3793" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Most of us stand out in our own minds. Each of us is the center of our own universe. Because we are so focused on our own behavior, it can be difficult to arrive at an accurate assessment of how much&mdash;or how little&mdash;our behavior is noticed by others. Indeed, close inspection reveals frequent disparities between the way we view our performance (and think others will view it) and the way it is actually seen by others.<sup class="ebsup1"><a id="calibre_link-329" href="#calibre_link-176" class="calibre4 pcalibre">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3794">The things we dread&mdash;tripping while walking down the street, making a social gaffe at a party, or misreading something in a classroom&mdash;are rarely picked up on. And if they are noticed, they are usually forgotten.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3795">This is great news! If you mess up or expose your vulnerability, most people won’t even notice. Now I know what you’re thinking: “But Vanessa, even though most people don’t notice, what about the few people who do?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3796">I’m so glad you asked!</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3797">VULNERABILITY IS ATTRACTIVE</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3798">Most people will not notice your flubs and failings. But what about the people who do?</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3799">Researchers Elliot Aronson, Ben Willerman, and Joanne Floyd wanted to know what people really think about those who make mistakes. In their study, they asked participants to listen to a recording of a student explaining how well he did on a quiz. The student talked about his background and then modestly described his 90 percent score on the exam.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3800">Here was the catch: One group of participants hears the student knock over a mug of coffee and ruin their clothes at the end of the recording. The other group hears no such spill. The researchers then asked both groups, “How likable was this student?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3801">Can you guess what happened? The student who spilled his coffee was rated as far more likable and socially attractive than the non-spilling student.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-330" href="#calibre_link-177" class="calibre4 pcalibre">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3802">Why? Mistakes humanize us. We all make mistakes, and we like people who are like us. (Remember Hack #5: Thread Theory?) Having above-average people skills is not about being perfect. It’s not about never making a social blunder again. Rather, people who have great interpersonal intelligence leverage their vulnerability.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3803"><a id="calibre_link-3804" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>If vulnerabilities were bad, <em class="calibre6">PostSecret</em> never would have turned into a phenomenon. Frank Warren wouldn’t be the author of five books and the founder of a secret empire.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3805">And let’s be real: <span class="strong">Trying to be perfect is not only impossible, it’s boring. Trying too hard smells like desperation. And staying in hiding is exhausting.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3806">Vulnerability is sexy&mdash;it shows we are relatable, honest, and real. That is attractive. And the science proves it: “A blunder tends to humanize him and, consequently, increases his attractiveness.”<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-331" href="#calibre_link-178" class="calibre4 pcalibre">5</a></sup></p>

<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3810">HOW TO BE VULNERABLE</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3811">I’m standing on tiptoes in a dark, stinky hallway. My high-heel-clad feet are killing me, and the wall I am leaning on is pulsing with the pop music blaring in the next room. I’m fifth in line for the tiny, crusty bathroom.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3812">Amazingly, this dank little corridor is actually my temporary escape from sitting at the sticky high-top tables and yelling over the loud music to people I barely know. It’s my friend’s thirtieth birthday party and she wants to “party like a twenty-one-year-old.” In sum, I’m in my personal social hell.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3813">I’m searching my clutch for some Advil when a girl I recognize from our party stands in line behind me. “Ugh,” she moans, “Seriously? This line is going to take forever!”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3814">Now, I have a choice. I could nod empathetically and carry on waiting, or I could be honest … and a little vulnerable. “Yeah, I’m not sure what’s worse&mdash;standing in line in these heels or sitting out there at those tables,” I say.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3815">She looks at me, looks down at my heels, and then bursts out laughing. “At least you’re not also wearing Spanx. My feet are numb and I can’t take a deep breath,” she says.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3816">Thank goodness! A fellow human. I counter, “But would you really want to take a deep breath in here? It smells like stale beer.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3817"><a id="calibre_link-3818" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>“Very good point. I’m just dreaming of my couch and my bathrobe right now,” she says.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3819">“I think I might cry tears of joy when I get to go home, put on my slippers, and turn on Netflix,” I confess.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3820">By the time it’s my turn in line, we are exchanging info and promising to get brunch next weekend. Later that night, I realize none of this would have happened had I not taken a small risk. I was uncomfortable&mdash;physically and socially&mdash;and I was not the only one. All I had to do was reach out.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3821">Living in truth and embracing vulnerability doesn’t mean walking up to strangers and saying, “Hi, my name is Vanessa and I’m a recovering awkward person.” Well … that works, too. But there are much subtler (and less scary) ways you can use the power of vulnerability in your life.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3822">FAVOR ME?</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3823">There’s a famous story about Benjamin Franklin&mdash;no, not the one involving lightning. This one is far less dramatic, but just as intriguing.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3824">In the 1700s, Franklin was an influential writer and politician. While working in the Pennsylvania state legislature, Franklin had to win over a particularly difficult politician who was not a fan of his policies. Franklin could follow the typical route and grovel for his favor … or he could try something different.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3825">Franklin&mdash;a lover of books&mdash;knew that this politician owned a copy of a rare book in his large home library. Franklin wrote him a letter asking if he could borrow the book. He said yes. After a few days, Franklin returned the book with a note of thanks. In subsequent meetings, the politician was friendlier and more attentive than ever before. Franklin had stumbled upon an interesting phenomenon: When someone does a kindness for you, they are more likely to like you.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-332" href="#calibre_link-179" class="calibre4 pcalibre">6</a></sup> This is dubbed the <span class="strong">Franklin effect</span>.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3826">Over a century later, Jon Jecker and David Landy wanted to confirm that the Franklin effect really works. In their experiment, they told participants they could win some money by completing a series of surveys. The “administrator” of these surveys was actually an actor tasked with treating the participants as rudely as possible while they completed tests. When finished, the participants received a small amount of cash.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3827"><a id="calibre_link-3828" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Now, here’s where it gets interesting. In trial one, the fake administrator follows the student out of the lab and asks for a favor. “Would you mind returning the cash? I’m funding the study with my own money, and we’re almost out of funding.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3829">In trial two, a fake “secretary” runs after the students and asks for the same favor.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3830">In trial three, the participants were able to keep their winnings and no one asked for a favor.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3831">A few days later, the researchers asked the participants in all three trials to rate the administrator on likability. Guess what? <span class="strong">The first trial participants rated the administrator as the most likable.</span><sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-333" href="#calibre_link-180" class="calibre4 pcalibre">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3832">Let’s think about this for a hot second: Imagine you are a student taking some surveys for extra money. The administrator of the survey is rude to you, telling you to hurry up and dismissing you abruptly. Then&mdash;after you have spent all this time completing the survey, the administrator has the gall to ask you to give back your winnings. Do you think you would rate him as likable? I don’t think so! But research shows that in reality, this would work.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3833">The Franklin effect is counterintuitive&mdash;which is what makes it so powerful. And it is our next hack:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-3834" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturecenter" id="calibre_link-3835"><span class="strong">HACK #12: The Franklin Effect</span></p>
<p class="eb20extrafeaturecenter" id="calibre_link-3836"><span class="strong">Don’t be afraid to ask for advice, share a vulnerability, or admit a weakness&mdash;they bond you to people.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3837">When the administrator asked for help and admitted a vulnerability, he became more human, more relatable.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-334" href="#calibre_link-181" class="calibre4 pcalibre">8</a></sup> How can we use the Franklin Effect hack authentically&mdash;without just asking for favors from everyone we meet? Three words: Ask for advice.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3838">ASK FOR ADVICE</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3839">Asking for advice is one of the best ways to get along with people and build lasting relationships. Here’s why:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-3840" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3841"><span class="strong">Asking for advice softly admits a vulnerability.</span> When you ask for advice, you are admitting a gap in knowledge or a need for help in an authentic, non-scary way.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3842"><span class="strong"><a id="calibre_link-3843" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Asking for advice gets people talking.</span> Remember how much people like to talk about themselves? Rather than being a burden, you spark pleasure (Hack #3: Conversational Sparks) and have the opportunity to highlight someone’s strengths (Hack #4: Highlighter). Being asked for our opinion shows that someone values what we have to say.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3844"><span class="strong">Asking for advice helps you solve someone’s matrix.</span> When someone gives you advice, you learn so much about them. You get insight into their perspective (Hack #7: Speed-Read) and the things that matter most to them (Hack #9: Primary Value).</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3845">Asking for advice doesn’t have to be a formal process. In fact, it is one of the simplest ways to stimulate fascinating conversation. Listen for anecdotes people tell about themselves, and then follow up by asking for advice in those areas. If an interviewer mentions loving to read, you can ask for recommendations. If a date says she grew up nearby, ask for hidden coffee spots. If someone mentions loving to cook, ask for any secret kitchen tips.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3846">Or kick off a conversation by asking for advice. These conversation sparkers work nicely:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-3847" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3848">Have any good restaurants you like?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3849">I’m thinking about taking a vacation at the end of the year&mdash;have you been anywhere great recently?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3850">I’m looking for a new book to read this summer&mdash;have anything you would recommend?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3851">What do you think I should get my girlfriend for our anniversary?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3852">I’m playing in a new fantasy football league&mdash;how do you think this season will end up?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3853">I’m thinking about buying a new car&mdash;do you like yours?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3854">My in-laws are coming for dinner&mdash;have any recipes you like?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3855">I have to open my speech next week with a joke&mdash;got any good crowd-pleasers?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3856">What do you think I should do for my birthday coming up?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3857">Seen any funny YouTube videos recently?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3858">My college friend is coming to visit&mdash;have any ideas for must-see hidden spots to take him?</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3859"><a id="calibre_link-3860" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>If you’re ever worried about running out of things to say in a conversation or meeting, you can switch to the topic of advice. Try these seamless transitions:</p>
<ol id="calibre_link-3861" class="calibre9">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3862" value="1">So, I would love your advice on something: ____</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3863" value="2">Hey, can I brainstorm some ideas with you about this new project I’m working on?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3864" value="3">Speaking of which, do you have any thoughts on how to fix/change/solve ____?</li>
</ol>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3865">You will notice that these transitions make people perk up. Their eyebrows will raise, they’ll lean in, and they’ll say something like, “Oh really? Happy to help.” We love to be helpful and be asked for help&mdash;and hopefully, their advice will actually help you.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3866"><span class="strong">Remember:</span> Never ask for advice you don’t actually need. Vulnerability is about honesty, it’s not a trick to be used without integrity.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3867">LOOK FOR ADVICE OPPORTUNITIES</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3868">Never miss an advice opportunity. You get them more often than you might realize.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3869"><span class="strong">Don’t miss casual opportunities for favors.</span> When I go to someone’s home, I always accept a glass of water when offered. People frequently tweet me cool links of studies about people&mdash;I almost always retweet them and thank them for the recommendation. Every few weeks, I go on LinkedIn and accept the extremely kind recommendations and endorsements people have given me. After speaking events, I regularly ask audience members or meeting planners to write testimonials if they enjoyed themselves.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3870">May I ask you for a favor? If you are enjoying this book, please write a review on Amazon. I would greatly, greatly appreciate it! Cute emojis encouraged. <span class="noemoji">☺</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3871"><span class="strong">Don’t be afraid to ask for casual advice.</span> You can ask for advice informally on e-mail or social media. I regularly post open questions on my social media to all my followers. Anything from: “Do you like this shirt?” to “Does anyone know any good graphic designers?” to “What’s the best way to cook eggplant?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3872"><a id="calibre_link-3873" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>I also post polls on Twitter asking for advice and votes. Like this one:</p>
<div class="landscape_medium" id="calibre_link-3874"><img src="images/000093.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-371" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3875"><span class="strong">Don’t undervalue unsolicited advice.</span> The Franklin Effect is not just about asking for advice. It’s also about taking advice, help, and support when it is offered to you. We tend to be defensive when someone offers unsolicited advice. However, this is actually an opportunity! This is an unsolicited opportunity to harness the power of the Franklin Effect.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3876">BE GRATEFUL</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3877">To double the power of the Franklin effect, thank someone when they’ve given you advice&mdash;and show them that you’re taking it seriously. You’ll make people feel validated, helpful, and included.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3878">My grandma taught me this. Grandma Dee loves to make her own clothes. One day she called me and left me a voice mail asking for my measurements, “From your neck to your toes and your shoulder to your wrist.” I had no idea what she was making me, but dutifully called her back with the measurements.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3879">A few weeks later, she showed up with matching muumuus made from her old living room curtains. “Don’t worry,” she assured me, “I made yours have a slit to the knee since you are younger than me.” Oh, and the best part? She had enough material for headbands.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3880">I gave her a hug and thanked her for it. She was pleased&mdash;after all, she had spent weeks sewing it. I realized that it would make her way happier if I actually wore it. So I put it on and wore it for the rest of the day. As I am sure you can imagine, my grandma was ecstatic. She insisted on taking pictures and talked about it for weeks with her friends.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3881">Now I try to pull out the muumuu whenever I see her&mdash;or at least wear the headband.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3882">Don’t be afraid to get creative with your gratitude! I send people <a id="calibre_link-3883" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>gratitude journals with the first page filled in with the ways I’m thankful for them. I regularly mail people three-leaf-clover seed packets for thanks and good luck. When I ask for testimonials, I put them on my website, take a screenshot, and send it to the person with a thank-you note. When family friends gave my husband and me advice on where to go in Italy for our honeymoon, we followed it, took pictures, and sent them a mini-album with a thank-you card from Italy.</p>
<div class="portrait_medium1" id="calibre_link-3884"><img src="images/000094.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-372" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3885">Don’t underestimate the basics, either: Always send a thank-you card.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3886">BONUS: ANTI-PERFECT</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3887">Perfection is a strange beast. We strive to be perfect so others will like us but don’t like people who try too hard to be perfect. The pursuit of perfection not only makes it nearly impossible to connect with people, it also makes us unattractive. Want to connect with people more quickly? Try to embrace these vulnerability cures:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-3888" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3889"><a id="calibre_link-3890" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Admit when you’re wrong</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3891">Don’t pretend to know a band you’ve actually never heard of</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3892">Ask for forgiveness</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3893">When you don’t know what a word means, ask</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3894">Say sorry</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3895">Be okay saying, “I don’t know”</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3896">Following these rules will help you build relationships.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3897">While standing in line at that awful nightclub, I opened a conversation with an honest admission and gained a friend. When I started writing this book, I began with a vulnerable confession. And I hope I gained you, as a reader.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3898">I can tie my greatest personal and professional achievements to single moments of vulnerability. For example, at a conference I once admitted to the woman sitting next to me that I had no idea what a speaker was talking about. She heartily agreed and we bonded while reminiscing about speaker horror stories. Later in the conversation, I found out she happened to be the head producer at CNN&mdash;a few months later, she created a segment for me to present my research on air and in columns.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3899"><span class="strong">In fact, when I share a confession or embarrassing story in my articles, more people read it, comment on it, and share it.</span> It’s almost as if my admission of weakness makes people comfortable with their own weaknesses&mdash;and then they’re more likely to accept help. Luckily, I am always happy to sacrifice my dignity for the sake of my readers.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3900"><span class="strong">Special Note:</span> Some people suck. Yes, there will be people who won’t welcome your vulnerability. And yes, you might even get people who try to use your weaknesses against you. But you know what? I think that is worth the risk. The way people respond to your honesty instantly shows you whether they are the kind of person you want to have in your life.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3901">If someone unsubscribes from my e-mail because they are offended at my lack of social grace, then they are not going to benefit from my tips.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3902">If that girl in the nightclub had rolled her eyes at my remark, I would have turned right around and kept looking for an Advil.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3903">If a reader picked up this book and couldn’t identify with awkward people, then this book wasn’t for them.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3904"><span class="strong">Bottom Line:</span> We all have weaknesses. The right people will like you for them.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3905"><a id="calibre_link-3906" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>IT’S NOT ABOUT THE SINGING</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3907">When I try to sing, I sound like a cat slowly dying of hypothermia. (No animals were harmed in the creation of this metaphor.)</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3908">So when I found out karaoke was the theme of my best friend’s rehearsal dinner, and I would have to participate as her “Babe of Honor,” I started Googling “easiest karaoke songs,” practicing in the shower, and generally freaking out.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3909">The big night came. At the karaoke machine, I turned to my husband, frantic. “They don’t have my songs!” I whispered.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3910">Ever calm, ever low neurotic, my husband said, “Don’t worry! You can do mine with me.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3911">Guess what he picked? “The Real Slim Shady” by Eminem. Have you ever tried to karaoke rap music? Well, let me tell you, it is <em class="calibre6">hard.</em> Like, get-tripped-up-on-your-tongue, spit-on-the-audience, and look-at-the-screen-blankly hard.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3912">About two stanzas in, I was lost and feeling pretty humiliated, when an older woman sitting next to the stage leaned over and said something that has stuck with me, “Don’t worry about being the best singer, <span class="strong">just commit.</span> It’s not about the singing.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3913">Somehow, this wiped the deer-in-the-headlights expression off my face. I pumped my hands up in the air and led the crowd in an impromptu wave. I threw out a couple of what <em class="calibre6">I</em> believed were hard-core hand gestures. Then I tried to breakdance.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3914">The crowd loved it. They laughed at my lame attempts at the worm, cheered when I dropped it like it’s hot, and enthusiastically demanded more waves. My “mistakes” were wildly entertaining. Why? I committed to them.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3915">If you will humor me for a moment: I believe this is a metaphor for life. Karaoke is not about the singing, it’s about making a song your own. <span class="strong">Life is not about being perfect, it’s about living it your way.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3916">As Frank Warren likes to say, “Free your secrets and become who you are.”</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3936">I’ve been screamed at, hung up on, and blown up at more times than I can count,” said Xochitl Gonzalez, “but that’s part of the job … and I love it.” Gonzalez organizes some of the most unique, memorable, and incredible weddings around the world, and she will be the first to tell you that she is as much an impromptu family counselor as a wedding planner. In fact, there is no better person than Gonzalez to teach us how to deal with difficult people. Why? The combination of new love, huge budgets, complicated family ties, and unexpected expenditures can make hers one of the toughest interpersonal jobs in the world.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3937">After thousands of weddings, Gonzalez has discovered her own set of people patterns. And her observations are fascinating. A bride with low self-esteem usually has a helicopter mom. An assertive father typically has a daughter who marries a timid husband&mdash;“Perhaps because she already has a dominant male figure in her life?” Gonzalez guesses. Very meek grooms typically have either an opinionated fiancée or mother&mdash;if it’s both, Gonzalez knows it’s going to be a tough wedding.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3938">“I’ll never forget one bride who became obsessed with the party favors. When the luxury box of chocolates she had finally chosen didn’t turn out the way she had hoped, she became extremely upset,” explained Gonzalez. The bride screamed at the caterers and became strangely fixated on ribbons.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3939">Gonzalez suspected something more was going on. She knew that in the midst of planning a wedding, the bride would be adopting her fiancé’s children, quitting her job, and moving to the suburbs to be a full-time <a id="calibre_link-3940" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>mom. “She had A LOT going on. I knew the favors were just symbolic of something else. So, I called her and said, ‘Is this really about the chocolates?’ ”<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-336" href="#calibre_link-183" class="calibre4 pcalibre">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3941">Gonzalez was right. The chocolates were only a trigger for the bride’s feelings that her life was spinning out of control. Luckily, Gonzalez was able to get to the root cause of the emotion. She encouraged the bride to have a much-needed conversation with her soon-to-be-husband and prevented a difficult situation from exploding into an impossible one.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3942">SOCIAL FEAR</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3943">Gonzalez has two rules for dealing with difficult people:</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3944">First, <span class="strong">prevent good people from becoming difficult</span>.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3945">Second, <span class="strong">stop difficult people from being impossible</span>.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3946">In both cases, the behavior stems from one thing: fear. When a bride freaks out over a dress or a mother-in-law blows up at a caterer, it’s usually not about the dress or the food. It’s simply fear coming out as something else&mdash;fear about not pleasing people, fear about money, or even fear about the marriage. When we are afraid, our worst selves rear their ugly heads.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3947">In social situations, fears can become even more aggravated. When we are around others, we fear:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-3948" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3949">Being judged</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3950">Not being liked</li>

<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3961">Being forgotten</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3962">Being different</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3963"><a id="calibre_link-3964" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Which of these items resonates most for you? <span class="strong">When you interact with people, what are you afraid of?</span> These are your gremlins.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3967">Our gremlins give us social anxiety, make us awkward, and muddle up our charisma. They’re also largely invisible to us. We very rarely say, “I’m in a bad mood because I’m afraid of being rejected.” Or “I yelled at you because I am terrified of being criticized myself.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3968">I like to say that fear is a cross-dresser. It likes to wear different outfits. Sometimes fear can cause us to:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-3969" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3970">Be people pleasers</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3971">Be bossy</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3972">Be defensive</li>

<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3983">Be selfish</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3984">Be dramatic</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3985">Looking at this list, which sounds most like your reaction to fear? <span class="strong">How does your fear dress up?</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3986">We each have a gremlin that causes us to be difficult on our worst days. I can tell you my biggest gremlins are being excluded, feeling weird, and being different. My gremlins pop up anytime, anywhere for a host of different reasons. When I’m extremely nervous, I still get hives on my arms and legs. So I have to constantly check for them in awkward social situations and spend most of the time praying I won’t have a breakout. I <a id="calibre_link-3987" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>don’t like the taste of alcohol, so I’m always nervous about being the party pooper and unfun invitee&mdash;and often volunteer as sober driver. I have a really hard time hearing in loud rooms and almost always end up being the last to arrive and first to leave.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3988">Mostly, I’m terrified that who I am will turn people off. My fear dresses up as awkwardness. When I’m in a survive situation, I clam up, make terrible, offensive jokes, and can’t stop talking. No really, I don’t shut up. Guess what happens next? Yup, exactly what I feared most. People think I’m weird and different. And then exclude me. In a crazy way, our fear makes our gremlins come true.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3989">I have found that our gremlins make us act in quite predictably difficult ways. They fall into these four categories:</p>
<div class="landscape_large1" id="calibre_link-3990"><img src="images/000096.gif" alt="image" id="calibre_link-3991" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3992">All of us tend to fall into one of these categories on our worst days. <span class="strong">Be honest: which sounds most like you in your bad moments?</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3993">Don’t worry! You are not alone and it is <em class="calibre6">not</em> your fault. There’s a neurological explanation for why you feel this way.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3994"><a id="calibre_link-3995" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>THE SCIENCE OF FEAR</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3996">Joseph LeDoux, a New York University psychologist and neuroscientist, studies what he calls fear learning: the way our brains learn to detect and respond to external threats.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-337" href="#calibre_link-184" class="calibre4 pcalibre">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3997">You might not be surprised to learn that fear is processed in the amygdala (remember, this is also where we process pleasure and produce dopamine). LeDoux found that the amygdala’s fear responses can travel by not one but two pathways: the fast “low road” between the thalamus and the amygdala, and the slower “high road,” which begins at the thalamus but takes a detour to the neocortex before reaching the amygdala.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-338" href="#calibre_link-185" class="calibre4 pcalibre">3</a></sup></p>
<ul class="none1" id="calibre_link-3998">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-3999"><span class="strong">Low Road:</span> This is the fast, automatic, primary fear response that helps us <em class="calibre6">react</em> quickly to a threat. The low road helps us survive.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-4000"><span class="strong">High Road:</span> This is a slower, more logical secondary fear response that helps us <em class="calibre6">think</em> through a threat. The high road helps us thrive.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4001">Let’s say you’re driving down the street and an accident happens right in front of you.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4002">Immediately, your Low Road kicks in&mdash;within 12 milliseconds. You hit the brake, your blood starts pumping, you suck in a breath of air, and your eyes go wide so you can take in more of the scene.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4003">About 30 to 40 milliseconds later, your High Road jumps in. It processes what you just saw&mdash;should you call 911? Do you need to help the drivers? Should you pull over?</p>
<div class="landscape_default" id="calibre_link-4004"><img src="images/000097.jpeg" alt="image" id="calibre_link-373" class="calibre1" /></div>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4005"><a id="calibre_link-4006" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>This fear processing system works great&mdash;most of the time. The problem is, the Low Road and the High Road have two slightly different goals.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4007">Our Low Road wants us to be safe, protected, and secure. It wants us to survive without bodily harm.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4008">Our High Road wants us to make good decisions that help us thrive. It wants us to have connections, reproduce, and be happy.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4009">Sometimes these goals are aligned, and sometimes they aren’t. “The two paths do not always reach the same conclusions,” explained LeDoux.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-339" href="#calibre_link-186" class="calibre4 pcalibre">4</a></sup> For example, if you are afraid of rejection, your Low Road can kick into threat response mode. The moment you enter into a difficult interaction, you get sweaty palms, feel flushed, and have the desire to take flight. This Low Road response makes it impossible to be witty, build connections, or have a relaxed conversation.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4010">Psychologist Dr. Daniel Goleman calls this emotional hijacking.</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-4011" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-4012"><span class="strong">Emotional Hijacking</span>: When your Low Road is in an emotional fear response, you cannot connect with your High Road, make logical decisions, or act in your best social interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4013">He believes emotional hijacking is the reason social situations can be difficult&mdash;and why difficult people can be difficult.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4014"><span class="strong">Your gremlins are not just distracting; they force you into survival mode</span>. Have you ever tried to have an intelligent conversation when you have dry mouth from nerves? Ever tried to be funny when you felt awkward? It’s almost impossible. This is because your apelike Low Road is slowing down your clever High Road.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4015">“Emotional systems tend to monopolize brain resources. It’s much easier for an emotion to control a thought than for a thought to control an emotion,” explained LeDoux.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-340" href="#calibre_link-187" class="calibre4 pcalibre">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4016">Triggers from your past can also condition you to react fearfully to relatively minor events. Let’s say your crush laughed in your face when you asked her to dance at your eighth-grade prom. You remember blushing uncontrollably as her friends giggled and pointed at you. You began to sweat and couldn’t breathe deeply (Low Road). You had no idea what to do, so you ran out of the room and hid in the bathroom. You decided to wait there until the dance was over (High Road).</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4017">As an adult, every time you enter a dark club with loud music and <a id="calibre_link-4018" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>approach a woman to dance, your Low Road kicks in. It recognizes this scenario&mdash;and the time it didn’t go so well. So you begin to sweat, blush, and hyperventilate before you even talk to the girl. Your Low Road is telling you: “Run!” “Hide in the bathroom!” “Don’t talk to her!” Even though your High Road is telling you to approach the girl, and it has been a long time since your eighth-grade dance, your Low Road is <span class="strong">emotionally hijacking you.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4019">This is why, in the Social Game Plan hack, you narrowed down your survive and thrive places. It’s impossible for you to implement people hacks when you’re in Low Road, survival mode. I want to get you into situations where your Low Road can stay quiet to allow your High Road to take over and be your awesome self. Difficult people don’t do this well.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4020">I don’t believe difficult people are bad people. I believe they are being emotionally hijacked the majority of the time. Their fear puts them in constant survival mode. And their gremlins make it impossible for them to compassionately connect or rationally compromise.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4021">“We know that lots of people have fears that they can’t come to conscious terms with,” said LeDoux.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-341" href="#calibre_link-188" class="calibre4 pcalibre">6</a></sup> Our emotions are fully capable of overriding reason. The question is: How can we help difficult people overcome their fear and be more socially smart?</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-4022">THE NUT JOB</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-4023">Sometimes nutty people drive me bat-poop crazy. When someone’s gremlins are too much for me to deal with, I use a simple technique that I call:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-4024" class="calibre8">

</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4027"><span class="strong">The NUT Job both prevents crazy and calms crazy.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4028">This powerful little hack is a simplified version of a hostage release technique taught by Dr. Mark Goulston<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-342" href="#calibre_link-189" class="calibre4 pcalibre">7</a></sup>&mdash;yes, dealing with a difficult person can be like negotiating with a kidnapper. Let’s put on our big-boy pants.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-4029">Step #1: Name</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-4030">Most gremlins are a product of not being recognized, accepted, or heard. You can quiet these fears by showing someone that you do recognize, <a id="calibre_link-4031" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>accept, and hear exactly where they are coming from. This is done by the first stage of the NUT Job: naming.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4032">In naming, you are trying to find the answer to:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-4033" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturecenter" id="calibre_link-4034"><span class="strong">What is this person afraid of?</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4035">The moment you identify the emotion someone is feeling, you open a release valve for their anxiety. Sound easy? It is simple, but for some reason it feels counterintuitive to most of us. <span class="strong">Typically, when someone is emotional and we are not, we try to counterbalance them by staying calm. But this doesn’t work</span>. In fact, it usually only infuriates an upset person even more.</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4112">In this version, notice that the man is simply reflecting the emotion words back at the speaker, trying to get to the root of her fear. This helps him comprehend what’s going on and allows her to sort out her emotions. Once she feels heard and validated, then she moves into stage two of the NUT Job: understanding.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4113"><a id="calibre_link-4114" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>My favorite phrases for naming:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-4115" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-4116">You seem ____.</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-4117">Are you feeling ____?</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-4118">Give me a sense for what you’re feeling.</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4119"><span class="strong">Special Note:</span> Decoding microexpressions is also incredibly helpful for naming&mdash;especially when someone isn’t being as vocal about their emotions as you’d like. Naming an emotion you read on their face is just as effective.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-4120">Step #2: Understand</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-4121">Once someone feels heard, their Low Road fear begins to disengage and the High Road starts to kick in. Already, you’re dealing with a more logical, rational, and relationship-oriented person.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4122">The goal of the understanding phase is to unpack emotions behind what’s being said. During this time, you are trying to:</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4157"><a id="calibre_link-4158" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Based on her answers, it sounds like her primary value is Information or Status. Say the man asks more questions and narrows it down to Information. This is key information! Wanting a promotion right away is one thing. But merely wanting to know if you’re <em class="calibre6">deserving</em> of a promotion, and whether there is a timeline in place, is a very different goal. Here’s where the next step of the NUT Job comes in: Transform.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4159">My favorite phrases for understanding:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-4160" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-4161">Tell me what happened that made you feel this way.</li>

<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-4163">What caused this _____?</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-4164">Step #3: Transform</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-4165">Once someone is fully in High Road&mdash;their fears are disengaged and they’ve worked through the problem out loud&mdash;you can begin to transform the problem into a solution.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4166">Note: Do NOT try to move onto the Transform step until you are fully done naming and understanding. If someone is still speaking in a loud voice, tearful or flushed with emotion&mdash;they are not done processing yet.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4167">Once someone gives a big sigh of relief, begins to talk at a normal <a id="calibre_link-4168" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>level, and sounds more like themselves, then you can move on. In the Transform stage, you have two options: speed-read or use their appreciation language. If you can offer answers or facilitate a resolution&mdash;even better!</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4169">Sometimes, as with many problems, they cannot fully be “fixed.” In that case, you are best going into appreciation language mode. You can at least value the person and make them feel less alone.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4170">During this stage, you’re answering the question:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-4171" class="calibre8">

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4212">When you value difficult people, they will be less apathetic, angry, and fearful, and more compassionate, understanding, and open. However, you will meet difficult people that don’t respond well to even the most empathetic tactics. Their fear is so ingrained that they become impossible to deal with.

<h5 class="box_title" id="calibre_link-4214"><span class="strong">FAST FACT BOX</span></h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-4215">Unfortunately, most of us have a toxic person in our life. Seventy-three percent of people in our Twitter poll said they did.</p>

<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-4217">BONUS: HOW TO SAY NO</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-4218">Toxic people constantly throw you into Low Road survival mode. They push boundaries, challenge your worth, and can even turn thrive situations into survive ones by waking up your gremlins. <span class="strong">Toxic people are not worth your energy.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4219">However, many of us have Low Road fears about saying no. We say yes <a id="calibre_link-4220" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>out of habit, or because it’s scary to set up boundaries. Or&mdash;let’s be real&mdash;we feel we don’t deserve to stand up for ourselves.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4221">It’s time to give yourself permission to say no to the toxic people who drain you. You deserve to interact on your terms, with people you like. <span class="strong">When you say no to the wrong relationships, you make room to say yes to the right ones.</span> Here’s how to say no:</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-4222">Step #1: Eat Humble Pie</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-4223">Saying no doesn’t mean you should be ungrateful. You can set boundaries and say no without offending anyone.</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-4224" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-4225">“Thank you so much for asking.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-4226">“How wonderful of you to offer.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-4227">“This is a lovely idea.”</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-4228">Step #2: No Hemming and Hawing</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-4229">Don’t beat around the bush. If you hesitate or waver, toxic people will sense weakness and try to change your mind. Be clear and concise.</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-4230" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-4231">“I’m so sorry I won’t be able to join.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-4232">“I won’t be able to get together.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-4233">“I can’t come.”</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-4234">Step #3: No Excuses</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-4235">This is the most important step! You don’t have to defend, debate, or explain your feelings. That’s right, you don’t need to give a reason. In fact, when you do offer an explanation (even when it’s legitimate), it just ends up sounding like an excuse. Offering a why also gives toxic people room to argue with you&mdash;and oh, they will. Toxic people do not like when boundaries are placed on them.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4236">Here’s what happens when you try to offer toxic people a reason (real or not):</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-4237" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-4238"><span class="strong">Toxic Person:</span> “You have another party? No worries, just pop over for a little!”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-4239"><span class="strong">Toxic Person:</span> “You’re busy? I’m busy, too&mdash;this will only be twenty minutes, you have to get coffee at some point, right? I’ll just meet you for a little catch-up.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-4240"><span class="strong"><a id="calibre_link-4241" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Toxic Person:</span> “Don’t worry about being tired. You’ll get energized with all the drinks!”</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4242"><span class="strong">Special Note:</span> If you have trouble doing this in person, you can always ask for time to think about an invite. Say you have to check your calendar and you’ll get back to them in a few days. You can also e-mail or text a response so you can choose your words carefully&mdash;sometimes hard to do when face-to-face. You’ll get more comfortable with practice.</p>
<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-4243">Optional Step: Step It Up</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-4244">If you get an invitation you’re not crazy about, sometimes you can make a counteroffer. For example, a friend of mine invited me to her birthday at a pool hall. I knew it would not be my scene, nor a good way to catch up with her. I offered to take her to brunch that morning instead, which worked out better for both of us because we got to really talk. You could say:</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-4245" class="calibre7">
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-4246">“I can’t do dinner, but let’s grab a coffee instead.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-4247">“A meeting won’t work, but let’s hop on the phone.”</li>
<li class="eb24list_un" id="calibre_link-4248">“Sorry I can’t make the party; can I take you out to brunch tomorrow?”</li>
</ul>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4249">I know it’s hard to say no. But this sets you up for growth.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4250">Sometimes farmers have to burn their fields in order to make way for a healthy crop. Fire is a natural part of the ecological cycle. The old crop’s residue and weeds must go. They call this process a controlled burn.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4251"><span class="strong">Do you need to start your own controlled burn?</span> Clearing out the weeds makes room for new growth.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4252">For Xochitl Gonzalez, learning to say no was one of the most difficult parts of her professional growth. “You want to help everyone. But not everyone can be helped,” said Gonzalez. “This job taught me how <em class="calibre6">not</em> to be a people pleaser. I don’t hold myself to other people’s compliments or requirements. I have my own standards for excellence and I hold my ground. If I suspect someone can’t handle that, I don’t work with them.”<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-343" href="#calibre_link-190" class="calibre4 pcalibre">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4253">You cast the people who you want to play a role in your life. Choose wisely.</p>

<h3 class="eb04mainheadclosedtitle" id="calibre_link-4271">How to turn people on</h3>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-4272">“My hero is coming to dinner.” This is what I said to my husband as I frantically prepared dinner, cleaned up the house, and tried to look as presentable as possible. <em class="calibre6">New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em class="calibre6">Predictably Irrational</em>, behavioral science icon and TED Talk star Dan Ariely would be at my house in thirty minutes … and I was freaking out.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4273">A few months earlier, Ariely found my e-mail address and sent me a note saying he enjoyed my YouTube videos. After screaming for joy, briefly passing out, and overcoming a long bout of uncontrollable hiccups, I was able to reply coherently, and even mention some new research I was working on. Thus began our geeky friendship. Now Ariely and his wife were visiting Portland and stopping by for dinner.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4274">The moment Ariely and his lovely wife, Sumi, walked through the door, I was starstruck. But I quickly realized that Ariely wasn’t there to impress us. He was there to learn. Over appetizers, dinner, and two bottles of wine, Ariely asked questions. Instead of talking about his groundbreaking work and research, he gently and curiously turned the spotlight on everyone else at the table. My husband’s work, his wife’s opinions, my goals. By the end of the evening, I was floating. I felt like I was on a relationship high&mdash;and it had nothing to do with Ariely’s professional accolades or fame. It had to do with his unique approach to people.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4275">Dan Ariely has an intense curiosity. It comes across not only in his work&mdash;he has four books and five TED Talks with over 13 million views&mdash;but also in his everyday interactions. <span class="strong">His sincere curiosity makes him incredibly engaging.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4276"><a id="calibre_link-4277" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>Ariely’s inquisitive nature is also responsible, at least in part, for his tremendous success&mdash;beginning with his decision to follow his current career path. When Ariely was seventeen years old, he accidentally set off an explosion that burned 70 percent of his body.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-345" href="#calibre_link-192" class="calibre4 pcalibre">1</a></sup> For months, he went through excruciating surgeries and skin grafts. During this process, he faced the ultimate torture: getting bandages removed.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4278">Have you ever had to take off an old Band-Aid? You can either rip it off quickly&mdash;a short, intense pain. Or you can pull it off slowly&mdash;less intense pain over a longer period of time. “The nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one, so they would grab hold and they would rip, and they would grab hold and they would rip. And because I had 70 percent of my body burned, it would take about an hour,” recalled Ariely.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4279">As soon as Ariely got out of the hospital, he enrolled in Tel Aviv University, where he began to do experiments on pain, tolerance, and relief. “At the end of this process, what I learned was that the nurses were wrong,” said Ariely.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4280">It turns out that the best possible way to minimize a patient’s pain is not to rip off the bandages quickly, but rather to go slower with less intensity. “My nurses had no idea,” explained Ariely.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-346" href="#calibre_link-193" class="calibre4 pcalibre">2</a></sup> They’d been confident in their opinion to the point of irrationality&mdash;despite the evidence staring them in the face.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4281">This simple, powerful discovery was the first of many for Ariely. He has built a career out of making seemingly irrational behavior predictable. He engages people with his distinctive brand of curiosity. And his inquisitiveness has brought him tremendous success.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4282">How can we adopt Ariely’s approach? In this final hack, let’s find out.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-4283">THE SCIENCE OF POPULARITY</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-4284">What makes someone popular? Researchers at Columbia University were surprised to find that popularity isn’t correlated with physical attractiveness, athleticism, intelligence, or humor, but to certain brain patterns. <span class="strong">Specifically, popular people are more attuned to</span> <span class="bolditalic">other</span> <span class="strong">people’s popularity.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4285">In their study, Noam Zerubavel and his team asked participants from two student groups to rank each other by popularity. They then put each participant in a brain scanner and flashed pictures of the group members <a id="calibre_link-4286" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>they had just ranked. They mixed in a few fake pictures. Students had to quickly press a button indicating whether the picture was real or fake.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4287">They found that all of the participants&mdash;regardless of their own popularity&mdash;had more brain activity in the reward center of the brain when viewing the faces of popular people from their group. Simply put: <span class="strong">Popular people literally make us feel good.</span> This might be why we are so drawn to watching celebrities on television.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4288">But here’s the most interesting part of the study: There was a significant difference in the brain response of the popular students. The most popular participants had the largest neural response when viewing fellow popular students, especially in the “social cognition” part of the brain. In other words, <span class="strong">popular people are more attuned to social signals, social hierarchy, and relationships&mdash;and they place higher value on these cues</span>.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4289">Popular students were also more aware of their own social status and more accurate at guessing how well liked they were by others. The authors suggest that popular people are popular because they enjoy trying to understand what people around them are thinking and feeling. They call this enhanced social attunement.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-347" href="#calibre_link-194" class="calibre4 pcalibre">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4290">Now I understand what happened at dinner with Dan Ariely&mdash;I was hit full force by his ability to attune to me. The way he <em class="calibre6">thinks</em> changed the way I <em class="calibre6">felt.</em> First, let’s be real, my mental reward center tingled by his world-renowned social status. And then, my social cognition system kicked into thrilling gear by his desire to get to know me.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4291">This is how you turn people on. <span class="strong">You don’t impress people by mentioning your accolades, accomplishments, or awards. You impress them by mentally turning on their reward systems.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4292">Here’s the great news: Regardless of how popular you are, anyone can learn how to be more socially attuned.</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-4293">SOCIAL ATTUNEMENT</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-4294">Growing up, there were two small letters that sent chills down my spine: PE. Physical Education class was the bane of my awkward, prepubescent existence. The moment I walked into the musky locker room to change, my heart would start to pound. As I surreptitiously tried to change without flashing an inch of skin (sometimes even wearing a second bra as insurance) I would desperately search for any excuse to <a id="calibre_link-4295" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>escape the daily drills and dodgeball games. Paper cut? Haircut? Apocalypse? I tried them all.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4296">Looking back, I realize I liked playing outside. What I really dreaded was the moment my coach said, “Line up, let’s pick teams!”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4297">Inevitably, the two jockiest kids were assigned as team captains, and then I spent an agonizing few minutes watching them go through my entire class before picking me or my fellow nonathletically inclined buddy, Smelly Matthew. Then one day, my elementary school social life changed. Our coach decided to allow the new girl to be team captain. She had just transferred from a nearby school and didn’t know anyone. In one of the greatest moments in PE history, she picked me <em class="calibre6">first</em>!</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4298">I was so excited that I ran over to her and then held her hand while she picked the rest of our team. I think we lost in soccer that day, but I was on top of the world. After the game I asked her why she picked me. And then she said one of the greatest things anyone has ever said to me, “I wanted to get to know you.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4299">As humans, we so desperately want to be known. We want to feel like people get us, like we have someone on our side, like a group wants to have us as a member. <span class="strong">Making people feel this way is called attunement&mdash;and it is one of the most underutilized social skills.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4300">When we attune, we are more receptive to and more aware of those around us. Attunement is also about acclimatizing or harmonizing with the people we are with. This is the final hack we will learn:</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4304">We are often so wrapped up in our own thoughts, schedules, and agendas that we forget to tune into other people’s feelings, needs, and values.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4305"><span class="strong">Special Note:</span> This is the <em class="calibre6">only</em> hack that should be wielded selectively. It is one of the most powerful tools for connection and should therefore be used only with those whom you truly want to build a deep connection with.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4306">Here’s how attunement works.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-4312">Stanford researcher Van Sloan studied the social skills of 2,437 high school students across counties in Northern California.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-348" href="#calibre_link-195" class="calibre4 pcalibre">4</a></sup> He wanted to know which social skills predicted likability as measured by their peers.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4313">First&mdash;and not all that unexpectedly&mdash;he found that likable students tended to be more optimistic and upbeat, and had higher self-reported levels of general happiness. But then the results get a bit more interesting: He found that <span class="strong">the most likable students also</span> <span class="bolditalic">liked</span> <span class="strong">the most other people.</span> Popular students showed their “liking” for others through higher levels of friendliness and smiling. “For females, number of smiles per day was two times more significant to their popularity than physical attractiveness,” wrote Van Sloan.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-349" href="#calibre_link-196" class="calibre4 pcalibre">5</a></sup> The more a student smiled at their classmates, the more their classmates smiled back at them. This made them <em class="calibre6">feel liked</em>, which made them like that student even more. <span class="strong">We are more inclined to enjoy being with people who visibly enjoy being with us.</span></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4314">In social psychology, this is called the reciprocity effect.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-350" href="#calibre_link-197" class="calibre4 pcalibre">6</a></sup> We like people who like us. We also feel the need to give back the kind of treatment we receive. So if someone smiles at us, we smile back. If someone asks us questions, we feel the need to ask questions back. If someone shares a vulnerability, we feel the need to share a vulnerability back. Every hack you have learned in this book so far was to engage the reciprocity effect.</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-4342">TV mogul and entrepreneur Oprah Winfrey has interviewed thousands of people in her years as a TV host. What has she learned from all of these experiences?</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-4343" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-4344">There’s one desire we all share: We want to feel valued.

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4345">The greatest gift we can give the people we encounter is to help them feel accepted for who they are. When my elementary school friend picked me to be on her team, it was one of the first times I felt accepted. When she wanted to get to know me, I finally felt like I was being heard.

<h4 class="headb" id="calibre_link-4369"><a id="calibre_link-4370" class="pcalibre calibre5"></a>#3: Curiosity</h4>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-4371">Dan Ariely turned a painful, traumatic experience into a learning opportunity. Instead of being paralyzed by the memories of ripping bandages, he got curious about them. His desire to learn more led him to major breakthrough discoveries about pain that have helped thousands of patients, doctors, and nurses around the world. Curiosity cured.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4372">If you’re like me, you might have your own painful social experiences. Maybe you were bullied in school. Perhaps even today you feel excluded by peers.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4373">Researchers at UCLA found that physical pain and social rejection activate the same parts of the brain.<sup class="ebsup"><a id="calibre_link-353" href="#calibre_link-200" class="calibre4 pcalibre">9</a></sup> In other words, when we are rejected, it feels like we are physically hurt.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-4374">We asked people on Twitter what would hurt more: a broken arm or being broken up with? Only 24 percent of people said a broken arm, while 76 percent of people said being broken up with would hurt more. So how do we protect against the pain of social rejection? I believe curiosity is a cure-all&mdash;and a great engagement technique.</p>
<ul id="calibre_link-4375" class="calibre7">

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-4406">At the very end of one of my phone calls with Dan Ariely, I asked him what advice he would give to people wanting to have more captivating interactions. He told me this:</p>
<blockquote id="calibre_link-4407" class="calibre8">
<p class="eb20extrafeaturelast" id="calibre_link-4408">From time to time I sit next to people on a plane or at a conference and they want to talk. Even if I am not in the mood, I know that if I want to have a good discussion, it is up to me. I can’t blame people for not being interesting or not being good to interact with. I take full responsibility for my interest. Even if I am different from someone, I try to learn from them. Even if I am not interested in something, I try to engage in a new way. I believe we are responsible for having captivating conversations, interactions, and relationships.<sup class="ebsup1"><a id="calibre_link-354" href="#calibre_link-201" class="calibre4 pcalibre">10</a></sup></p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-4417">Don’t impress people; engage them. Turn people on by showing them you are turned on by them. Attunement is about allowing people to be themselves with you. And the more people we truly like, the more people who will truly like us.</p>
