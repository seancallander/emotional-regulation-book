      <p class="first1">When I was five years old, my dad told me my first ever joke. I can remember it like it was this morning. There was a boy called Johnny Smells, and on his first day at school his teacher took him aside and said, <i class="calibre3">‘Listen, with that name, you’re going to get picked on quite a lot. I think you should go home and ask your parents if you can change your name’.</i> The next morning, Johnny’s teacher said to him, <i class="calibre3">‘Well, did your parents change your name?’</i> Johnny nodded. <i class="calibre3">‘Great, what is it now?’ ‘Benny Smells’.</i> I howled. My dad then made a fist, punched the palm of his other hand and added <i class="calibre3">‘That’s called the punchline’.</i> I can remember thinking ‘<i class="calibre3">Wow! You can punch someone with words and, not only that, it will make them feel good</i>’<i class="calibre3">.</i> Ever since that moment, I’ve been hooked.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I recently bumped into a very old friend from my childhood. We used to live in the same block of flats that had a communal garden where all the children would play together. She told me something that I have no memory of. Apparently, when I was around seven years old, I would regularly tell her jokes until she eventually said, <i class="calibre3">‘Adam, enough! I don’t want to hear any more jokes’.</i> I replied, <i class="calibre3">‘Please, I’ll pay you out of my pocket-money’.</i> Hearing that story touched my heart because I love jokes as much now as I did then. Essentially, I’m still that same little boy.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">At nine years old, I told my parents that I wanted to be a comedian, and I started writing jokes when I was nineteen. Although I’ve been a full-time comedian since 1995 and have spent most of that time travelling around the world doing the thing I love most, I’ve also ghostwritten for over fifty people. Many of them are household names in Britain and one is known globally. I’ve worked on twenty-nine projects with that person, and those jobs ranged from nine full days working on a film script to spontaneously standing under a bus shelter in close-to-torrential rain, bombarding them with short text messages because they’d just received an Oscar nomination and had half an hour to come up with a response for the global press. I’ve provided material that’s ended up as part of one comedian’s stadium tour, another comedian’s Netflix special, and my work has been quoted in <i class="calibre3">Time</i> magazine, credited to the person who employed me as a ghostwriter.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The reason for the title, <i class="calibre3">Finding Your Comic Genius</i> is because funny people are born, but comedians are made. A comedian can have an inspired thought, but if it’s not presented in the best way possible, it’s at risk of ending up as an average joke. Whenever this happens, it simply means that the comedian is a funnier person than they are a good comedian. So, the perfect thought is semi-redundant if it doesn’t end up as the perfect punchline, and my goal is to help you make every funny thought you have and every story you tell onstage become the best material it can possibly be.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s a slightly misquoted saying about comedy that has led to it being grossly misinterpreted by so many comedians: <i class="calibre3">‘Comedy is like a frog. If you dissect it, it dies’</i>. The misconception is that this somehow means: <i class="calibre3">‘If you discuss a joke, you’ll risk ruining it’</i>. This interpretation couldn’t possibly be more wrong. The actual quote, from E.B. White, is: <i class="calibre3">‘Explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog. You understand it better, but the frog dies in the process’</i>.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The key word is <i class="calibre3">‘understand’.</i> There’s nothing wrong with instinctively knowing that your new joke, routine or story is funny and leaving it there, because it gets good reactions and you’re happy with the quality of it. However, I believe that being able to take a funny moment, slow it down, zoom in on it and then improve it is just as valuable to a comedian as having funny ideas pop into their head. So, comedy is definitely like a frog. If you dissect it, it dies. However, the next time your pet frog isn’t feeling well, you’ll know how to make it get better. Just don’t let it see what you did to the other frog.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I recently shared many of my writing methods and theories with a few comedian friends, ranging from newer comedians to veterans of the art form, and was delighted to hear that they not only found them extremely useful, they also felt that several of my writing methods were new to them. So, this is definitely an advanced book on stand-up comedy. If you’re a comedy writer or your job involves public speaking, I believe that the seventeen chapters on writing will be very useful to you, which is why I’ve labelled them in the chapter headings. There’s also an in-depth chapter on corporate comedy that covers several areas of public speaking.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you’re not a comedian yet but couldn’t resist taking a glimpse into your future, you’ll no doubt be approaching this with as much enthusiasm as is humanly possible, and I love the idea that you’ll be applying my writing methods when preparing your first ever set. However, if you haven’t been onstage yet, there will inevitably be parts of the chapters on the performance side of stand-up that will make you feel you’re not ready for them. When this happens, I strongly urge you to make notes next to the bits that don’t quite make sense, and return to them once you’re a few months into your exciting journey as a comedian. The good news is that, by the time you’ve done around thirty gigs, you’ll know so much more about stand-up than you did the morning of your first gig. So, when you return to the sections that you’ve made notes next to, everything will suddenly make so much more sense.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although many of my writing jobs involve sitting on my own at a desk, I’ve worked face-to-face with around thirty comedians, which often forced me to articulate exactly why I’d instinctively chosen to reword any specific piece of their material the way I did. The outcome of being in that situation hundreds of times was that I developed the ability to put several of my intricate methods into words. You’ve no doubt tied a shoelace tens of thousands of times, but if I asked you to explain how to do it to someone over the phone without having a shoelace in your hands, it would be extremely difficult to do. I certainly don’t think I could do it. My extensive work as a ghostwriter has forced me to do the comedy equivalent of that, and that’s hopefully what makes this book unique. Examples of my own work will include material that didn’t work the first time I performed it, ambiguous material that needed tweaking, and brand-new material that I’ll be writing to show you my entire thought process. The only issue I have when it comes to learning from books is that I’m often left with unanswered questions. To try to get around that problem, I’ll be following several explanations by imagining what you might be thinking and responding to those thoughts, and I really hope that this method helps. You might be thinking, <i class="calibre3">‘No, it doesn’t’.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, three decades into working as a comedian, having loved almost everything about my job (it’s not a job; it’s a passion that I get paid to do), I’m finally sharing all of my writing methods and theories on comedy. I believe they will help you to improve your ability to create many things, including the perfect punchline.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="title-page-contributor-primary-block" id="calibre_link-86">
      <p class="first1">When done well, comedy is like music. There’s a rhythm and flow that’s not only pleasurable to listen to; it makes a punchline land with the maximum impact. Although a lot of comedians are aware that the final word of a punchline is important, many overlook the rhythm of the words leading up to it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">My dad was a very talented jazz musician and, as a child, I often spent my Sunday afternoons at his gigs, which no doubt had an influence on how I view flow in comedy. Around ten years ago, I came up with what I call the ‘Seesaw Theory’. If a punchline has a pause in it, I worked out that there should be noticeably more syllables at one side of that pause than the other, even on short punchlines.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I see the words in a punchline as two people sitting motionlessly on a seesaw. There’s a heavier person sitting at one end, and a lighter person at the other. It doesn’t matter which end is heavier &ndash; the left or the right &ndash; as long as one is heavier. This is a pattern I swear by, and whenever a comedian’s punchline with a pause in the middle sounds wrong, it’s almost inevitably down to them failing to create a ‘seesaw’. Not all punchlines need a pause; they can work without one for several reasons. However, when I sense that a punchline is missing a pause, that pause should never be slap-bang in the middle of it. This was quite a discovery, because I haven’t once found applying the Seesaw Theory to be ineffective.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although I claim to have worked this out myself, I should give most of the credit to my mum. When I was around ten years old, she told me that two-syllable first names tend not to complement two-syllable surnames. She then pointed out that first names of two or more syllables go well with one-syllable surnames, and the same applies to one-syllable first names with surnames of two or more syllables. This is, no doubt, partly why my parents called my sister Laura Bloom and me Adam Bloom.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">To demonstrate both types of seesaws as well as both types of non-seesaws, I’m going to use a made-up punchline, which means there will be no actual joke. It will be the only made-up punchline of the dozens that I’ll be sharing, quoting or writing in this book. This will not only allow all four versions to be grammatically correct, it will also allow me to explain the method in the next chapter. Suddenly, everything will come to life when I use an actual example that not only proves how effective both methods are, but how damaging not applying them can potentially be. So, stay with me, because this is all going to be worth it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s the first of the two versions that are seesaws &ndash; say all four examples out loud, because it’s all about the rhythm (syllable count in brackets):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">A &ndash; </b> <b class="calibre4">‘Guess what was on top of his piggy bank?…A rabbit’.</b> <b class="calibre4">(10 / 3)</b></i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is how I visualise ‘A’ in my mind’s eye whenever I hear this kind of rhythm in a punchline &ndash;</p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container">
          <img alt="" width="450" src="images/000003.jpeg" height="171" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s a perfect seesaw, because it bounces along nicely and is followed by a pause that puts all emphasis on the key word, <i class="calibre3">‘rabbit’.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look at the other type of seesaw. This time, the weight is at the other end. Remember; it’s all about the amount of syllables on either side of the pause.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Again, say this out loud:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘Guess what?…There was a rabbit on top of his piggy bank’. (2 / 12)</i></b></p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container">
          <img alt="" width="450" src="images/000004.jpeg" height="173" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">So, ‘A’ &amp; ‘B’ are both seesaws. However, ‘B’ is really pushing it when it comes to the syllable count, because it’s so much heavier at one end. Basically, 10 / 3 is much more likely to flow better than 2 / 12. You don’t have to count syllables; you just have to feel what sounds right. This method is just here to help you when something doesn’t sound right. If you don’t already, you’ll soon get a feel for when a seesaw works. We’ll look at another reason ‘A’ is better than ‘B’ for this particular punchline in the next chapter.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s nothing worse than being shown endless examples when you’ve already got the point. However, I should really show you the other two versions of this punchline that aren’t seesaws:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">C &ndash;  ‘Guess what was on top of his piggy bank?…The rabbit he was given for Christmas’. (10 / 10)</i></b></p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container">
          <img alt="" width="450" src="images/000005.jpeg" height="140" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">Finally:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">D &ndash;  ‘Guess what it was?…A rabbit’. (4 / 3)</i></b></p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container">
          <img alt="" width="450" src="images/000006.jpeg" height="80" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">Don’t be fooled by the length of the words on the left in ‘D’. Since the syllable count is 4 / 3, it’s as good as a straight line, which is why it doesn’t land well. If you say ‘C’ &amp; ‘D’ out loud, they simply don’t flow as well as ‘A’ &amp; ‘B’, and that’s purely because the two halves of the punchline are very similar in length.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s a good chance that, right now, you’re mentally going over some of your own punchlines and are starting to have doubts. Please don’t do that, because there are a few different things that can exist within a punchline with a pause in the middle that can allow it to not need a seesaw, and we’ll look at a few of those things later on.</p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container">
          <img alt="" width="450" src="images/000007.jpeg" height="383" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">Creating seesaws can definitely solve problems, and yet they’re something I’ve not once heard discussed. So, imagine how excited I was when I first started to share this method with comedian friends who said that a punchline of theirs didn’t sound right. This is a classic example of me stumbling across a pattern as a result of having to explain exactly why I’d changed the wording of someone else’s material. If I hadn’t written for other people, creating seesaws would probably have remained instinctive, and that pattern might not have ever occurred to me. Even if seesaws are instinctive to you, this is still a very handy method to apply whenever a punchline doesn’t sound right.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="title-page-contributor-primary-block" id="calibre_link-88">
      <p class="first1">I see punchlines involving anticipation as the comedian slowly blowing up a balloon and then sticking a pin in that balloon at the exact moment they want their audience to laugh, which is on the key word of the punchline. Unless your intention is to constantly and skilfully do something different (we’ll look at that soon), your aim should be to have as few syllables as possible after the key word of a punchline, because you don’t want a balloon to leak before it gets popped. If an audience gets a joke before you’ve finished speaking, the balloon starts to leak &ndash; resulting in a smaller ‘pop’ when you stick a pin in it. So, balloons should ideally be popped on the final word, creating the biggest laugh possible.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Let’s go back to the punchline about the rabbit on top of the piggy bank. We know that ‘A’ &amp; ‘B’ are both seesaws, but let’s look at them even closer to see which type of seesaw suits this particular punchline:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘Guess what was on top of his piggy bank?…A rabbit!’ (10 / 3)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The reason ‘<i class="calibre3">rabbit’</i> is the key word and not ‘<i class="calibre3">piggy bank’</i> is because, until the audience hear the final word of the punchline, they don’t know what’s happened<i class="calibre3">.</i> The balloon gets blown up when the audience wants to know what was on top of the piggy bank, and that balloon gets popped on the final word. So, ‘A’ has a perfect balloon pop at the end of a perfect seesaw.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look at why this joke doesn’t work with the weight at the other end of the seesaw:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘Guess what?…There was a rabbit on top of his piggy bank’. (2 / 12)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although ‘B’ just about works as a seesaw, the word<i class="calibre3"> ‘rabbit’</i> is followed by seven syllables which causes a big problem that is often overlooked by comedians. Since the key word is followed by several syllables, there’s a good chance that at least some of the audience will get the joke before the comedian has finished speaking, and that’s when air starts to leak out of the balloon. The anticipation blows up the balloon and, if no air gets let out of that balloon before it gets popped, the laugh is as big as it can possibly be.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s introduce the set-ups and see exactly where each balloon gets popped. The wording will vary slightly to allow them all to make sense:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘When he went downstairs, I crept into his bedroom. Guess what was on top of his piggy bank?…A rabbit!’ (big pop!)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s anticipation, a pause immediately before the key word, and the balloon is as big as it can be when it gets popped. Perfect.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look at ‘B’. Although it’s a seesaw, let’s look at exactly why it’s not right for this particular joke:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘When he went downstairs, I crept into his bedroom. Guess what?…There was a rabbit (leak) on top of his piggy bank’. (small pop!)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The balloon starts to leak on the word <i class="calibre3">‘rabbit’</i>, and therefore there’s a smaller pop by the time we get to the final word. Although the pause creates anticipation, the word <i class="calibre3">‘rabbit’ </i>lets the audience know the surprise seven syllables before the joke is over, and therefore the punchline loses impact. Once you see punchlines as balloons being blown up and popped, it suddenly looks obvious when you watch a badly structured punchline. Comedians getting mediocre reactions to punchlines as a result of them applying ‘B’ is one of the most common mistakes in comedy.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When it comes to popping balloons at the right moment, are there exceptions to this rule? Yes, of course &ndash; and that applies to all rules. Comedian Jeff Green has mastered not popping them at the ‘right’ moment. As a new comedian, I’d often watch Jeff and sense something was different. I eventually realised that he was deliberately popping his balloons mid-sentence in his punchlines, and then talking quietly underneath the laugh as he said the less important words that followed the key word. So, he was breaking this rule with technique, consistency and panache. As a result, his audiences weren’t ever forced to wait to laugh while air leaked out of a balloon, because his delivery allowed them to laugh at the perfect moment. This works in harmony with his laid back, conversational style.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">As you know, ‘C’ &amp; ‘D’ aren’t seesaws, but now let’s look at them even closer:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">C &ndash;  ‘When he went downstairs, I crept into his bedroom. Guess what was on top of his piggy bank?…The rabbit (big leak) he was given for Christmas’. (<span class="underline">tiny</span> pop!)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Have a good look at this sentence. Not only is there no seesaw, there are seven syllables after the key word, <i class="calibre3">‘rabbit’. </i>That creates a big leak, resulting in a tiny pop<i class="calibre3">.</i> The bigger the leak, the smaller the pop. Can you see why ‘C’ is an awful way to structure this punchline? If I’d heard someone saying this onstage, the pause &ndash; bang in the middle of the punchline &ndash; plus the leaking balloon would have both instantly sounded wrong.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look at ‘D’:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">D &ndash;  ‘When he went downstairs, I crept into his bedroom and I saw something strange. Guess what it was?…A rabbit!’ (small pop!)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This doesn’t look too bad. It ends on the key word that follows a pause. So, why is there a small pop? The missing seesaw means that there’s not only no rhythm, there’s no build-up of anticipation leading up to the word ‘<i class="calibre3">rabbit’.</i> Saying ‘<i class="calibre3">Guess what it was?’ </i>and then almost immediately revealing what <i class="calibre3">‘it’</i> was, doesn’t blow up a big enough balloon<i class="calibre3">.</i> Although there’s no leak, there’s only a small pop, due to there only being a small balloon. So, of the four versions, ‘A’ is easily the strongest and ‘C’ is easily the weakest.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s ‘C’ again:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">C &ndash;  ‘When he went downstairs, I crept into his bedroom. Guess what was on top of his piggy bank?…The rabbit he was given for Christmas’. (10 / 10)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Let’s look at all the reasons this fails as a punchline, as a reminder of the things I want you to avoid doing:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">It has no flow</li>
        <li class="calibre6">There is a pause, but no seesaw</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It lets air out of the balloon seven syllables before the final word</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Once you start to see punchlines this way, it soon becomes second nature to choose the best version, often without even having to consider any other ones.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’d like to say one more thing on the topic of talking immediately after the key word of a punchline. I often watch comedians deliver a perfectly good punchline, and then waffle when it’s over. Here’s an example:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">E &ndash;  ‘Guess what was on top of his piggy bank?…A rabbit! I mean, what was it doing there?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This kind of thing is very common and achieves nothing. When it’s said over the laugh it’s distracting, and even if it’s said after the laugh, it’s anticlimactic as the last thing the audience hear is an unfunny sentence. At best it gets a chuckle, and that’s never good if that chuckle follows a big laugh. I believe that the main reason comedians do this is because they don’t know what to do when their audience is laughing. So, commenting on the punchline gives them something to do. Personally, I’ll make the facial expression that fits with what I’ve just said. For example, if I’ve presented a mischievous premise, I’ll grin gleefully whilst my audience is laughing. This not only gives me something to do as they’re enjoying the punchline, that gleeful grin prolongs the laugh because I’m both enjoying the moment with them, and reminding them that the funny thought exists. If your persona is grumpy and your punchline is about something grumpy you’ve said, holding the grumpy expression when your audience is laughing achieves the same thing and is far more effective than following it up by saying something like:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I’m sick of that rabbit’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Okay, no more rabbits or piggy banks. I’m going to put everything we’ve just looked at to the test by studying an actual joke. This one belongs to one of the most revered joke-writers I know: Tim Vine. Despite being incredibly clever, his comedy is very silly and he’s often the victim of his jokes. Here’s a perfect example:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘So, I rang up British Telecom. I said, “I wanna report a nuisance phone call”. He said, “Not you again”’. (12 / 4)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although delivery gets completely lost with anything that’s written down, you can hopefully still see that this joke is succinct and delightfully silly. If only you could hear the rhythm and enthusiasm in his voice when he delivers that line. His upbeat tone makes it even funnier, because he doesn’t show any sign of being embarrassed about what’s just happened to him. The fact that he’s enthusiastically telling us about being a nuisance to someone else is agonisingly low status because he not only loses, he’s not in the slightest bit bothered by it. I howled with laughter the first time I saw him perform it. In fact, when I left a voicemail asking Tim’s permission to quote this joke, he replied with a voicemail that started with him telling the joke as if he was performing it onstage, and I howled again.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Whenever I mention a comedian you’re not familiar with, it would be a good idea to pause for a minute to watch a short clip of them online &ndash; or at the very least ‘Google Image’ them to get an idea of what they look like.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look at the punchline. Although it’s a long sentence, the reason it doesn’t need a pause is because Tim’s tone significantly drops on the words ‘<i class="calibre3">Not you again’</i>. This is a thing of beauty, because not only does it make him sound like another person, he gets across just how much that person isn’t pleased to hear from him, and it creates a variation of a seesaw because the tone is completely different at the short end of the punchline. So, adding a pause would be overkill. Let’s look at the punchline (drop in tone underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I wanna report a nuisance phone call’. He said, ‘<span class="underline">Not you again</span>’. (12/4)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Not only does it have a seesaw, there’s also a perfect balloon pop as the key word is <i class="calibre3">‘again’</i>. In print, it might seem that there’s a leak at <i class="calibre3">‘not you’</i>, but, at the pace he delivers it, there’s no chance that will happen.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Okay, here’s where things come to life. Look what happens if the other person’s response was slightly longer (extra words underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘I wanna report a nuisance phone call’. He said, ‘<span class="underline">Oh, bloody hell</span>, (leak) not you again’. (small pop!) (12 / 8)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Adding four extra syllables not only throws the rhythm off by ruining the seesaw, it also lets air out of the balloon before it gets popped, because the words <i class="calibre3">‘Oh, bloody hell’</i> reveal<b class="calibre4"> </b>that the other person clearly isn’t pleased to hear from Tim. This gives the audience a chance to get the joke before he’s finished speaking.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Look how much damage those four extra syllables can do to a punchline, and that’s exactly why they don’t exist in the original version. I’ve certainly seen much bigger signposts than someone saying <i class="calibre3">‘Oh, bloody hell’</i>, but I needed to create a short example to also demonstrate how easy it is to ruin the flow of a punchline. Tim may well have done those things instinctively, but that doesn’t change the fact that he did them. ‘B’ would still work, just not nearly as well.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The original version of Tim’s joke is masterful. It works in complete harmony with his persona, style and status. We’ll look at all of these things in depth later on. It truly is a perfect punchline, and the seesaw sublimely created by his change in tone combined with the maximum balloon pop both contribute to it being perfect.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I want to mention one thing on the topic of quoting comedians. When I started out, there were only a handful of female comedians working full-time on the UK comedy circuit. So, when I quote another comedian, it’s because it’s the best example I can think of based on my experience watching comedy when I started to piece things together as a new comedian. With the exception of one line that comes from a female perspective, none of the material I’ll be quoting from other comedians will have any relevance to gender.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">My aim here is to help you to make sure that redundant or damaging syllables never exist in your material and that you pop balloons at the exact moment you want to pop them.</p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container2">
          <img alt="" width="600" src="images/000008.jpeg" height="351" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">Imagine watching your favourite film again, and the screenwriter had somehow changed a word here or there. It would no doubt still be your favourite film, but it’s probably fair to say that there would be several moments that you once saw as pure poetry that are no longer perfect. I’ve got a friend who can quote every major scene from the film <i class="calibre3">Pretty Woman</i>. Just as they would want a classic line from any of those scenes to stay exactly as it is, I feel the same way about my favourite comedians’ material. I’m sure you can imagine my reaction if I heard someone quoting one of my favourite jokes and getting it wrong. Big mistake. Big. Very big.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">On the topic of getting words right, I’m used to communicating my ideas face-to-face, and my aim here is to get my points across as clearly as possible using the words I’d say if you and I were in the same room. So, as forensic as my approach is to writing material, I hope you can accept that when my spoken word is put into writing, it won’t always look like the written word you’re used to reading.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">In my experience of watching thousands of comedians, the ones who have key words mid-sentence either really know what they’re doing, or they really don’t<i class="calibre3">. </i>I don’t just want you to apply several of my methods to your comedy &ndash; I want you to find yourself talking about them. In fact, if by this time next week you’re not boring a friend or partner about something you’ve discovered, then I’ve failed. Once you’re aware of exactly when air gets let out of a balloon and the effects it can have on a punchline, unless you’re going to skilfully and consistently take control of those moments, why would you ever choose to do anything other than pop a balloon when it’s at its biggest? It’s so disappointing to watch a balloon deflate so much that it results in no pop whatsoever. Often, you can hear a pin drop.</p>

    <div class="title-page-contributor-primary-block" id="calibre_link-90">
      <p class="first1">Sometimes I’ll watch a comedian present a beautiful idea onstage, but they haven’t bothered to simply shuffle a few words around to create the best version of the punchline. I call this method ‘word smuggling’. Word smuggling is taking words from the punchline of a joke and moving them into the set-up, and is a seesaw and balloon pop’s best friend.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There are three main reasons for smuggling words:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">To de-clutter a punchline</li>
        <li class="calibre6">To allow a punchline to have more flow</li>
        <li class="calibre6">To allow a punchline to end on the key word</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Very often, a simple word smuggle can achieve all three of these things at once. I’d say it’s as useful a writing tool as I can think of, because there’s nothing less effective than a punchline with too much information in it. From an audience member’s perspective, it can feel like the comedian has thrown a Rubik’s Cube at their head and told them to solve it. By smuggling some of the information from the punchline into the set-up, you can do the dirty work early on, giving a punchline the maximum impact.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is very much like a magician doing a ‘move’ at the beginning of a trick, allowing the magic to happen in the spectator’s hand. Close-up magic has been my hobby since I was a child, and an old magician once said to me, <i class="calibre3">‘First you do the move, then you do the magic’</i>. To me, it’s often exactly the same with a joke; the set-up is the move, and the punchline is the magic.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’ve been juggling with words for so long that I can’t help thinking in punchlines, even when I’m writing a serious email. I’m going to give you an example of a very basic word smuggle that I applied at the end of the introduction. Say the version I used out loud (I’ve added a pause):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘I believe they will help you to improve your ability to create many things…including the perfect punchline’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although it’s not a joke, it’s got a nice rhythm and ends on alliteration. Here’s what I originally wrote <span class="underline">before</span> I smuggled some words:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘I believe they will help you to improve many things…including your ability to create the perfect punchline’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Notice that the alliteration loses most of its impact. This is because there are so many syllables between the pause and the words <i class="calibre3">‘perfect punchline’ </i>that they cloud it. ‘A’ is a classic example of an effective word smuggle, and is very simple to achieve. Let’s look at it in the form of a ‘before and after’ photo (smuggled words underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">Before:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I believe they will help you to improve many things…including your ability to create the perfect punchline’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">After:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I believe they will help you to improve <span class="underline">your ability to create</span> many things…including the perfect punchline’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, with this example, it was simply a case of cutting four words from the second half of the sentence and pasting them into the first half. This is why, when it comes to smuggling words, it’s much easier to type jokes out than to write them down by hand. Once you get used to doing that, you can start to do it inside your head. I often see comedians who’ve put words in such a bad order that all the beauty disappears.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s a worst-case scenario of the same sentence:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">C &ndash;  ‘I believe that they will help you to improve many things and creating the perfect punchline will be one of those things’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">You can no doubt see what a mess this sentence is. Not only has the alliteration as good as vanished, it now ends on a far weaker sound, ‘<i class="calibre3">things’.</i> Also, the word ‘<i class="calibre3">things’</i> is said twice in the same sentence, and in the least effective way possible. We’ll look at why it’s so ineffective in the chapter on repetition of words.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">To demonstrate a more complicated word smuggle, I’m going to deliberately write a messy joke now, and then show my entire thought process as I tidy it up. My main objective isn’t to write a great joke, but to make a great improvement of one:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘You know when you go through airport security; they make everyone take their belts off? I like to put mine back on standing next to a beautiful woman who’s doing the same thing, so it looks like we’ve just had sex’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Let’s look at this joke. It’s playful and, since it all takes place in my imagination, I’m not mocking anyone. It also works for all genders in my audience, if they want to picture themselves in my situation. I said it was going to be a deliberately messy joke, so let’s look at why it’s messy, and then try to tidy it up. This is going to happen step-by-step, and I won’t delete anything. My objective is for you to apply my methods to your own material.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">First, I want you to say the final sentence out loud:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I like to put mine back on standing next to a beautiful woman who’s doing the same thing, so it looks like we’ve just had sex’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">It has no flow whatsoever, there are thirty-one syllables, and there are no pauses. Assuming you just read it out loud, I trust you could hear that it isn’t at all punchy. Before I smuggle some words, I’m to add a seesaw, and here’s how I achieve that:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Put a full stop after the words <i class="calibre3">‘doing the same thing’</i></li>
        <li class="calibre6">Replace the word <i class="calibre3">‘so’</i> with the words <i class="calibre3">‘that way’</i></li>
        <li class="calibre6">Add a pause after <i class="calibre3">‘that way’</i></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">This is how it looks having done those three things:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘I like to put mine back on standing next to a beautiful woman who’s doing the same thing. That way…it looks like we’ve just had sex’. (2 / 7)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you haven’t already done it, say ‘B’ out loud. The punchline now lands much harder. Not only does it have a seesaw, the full stop allows the audience to fully absorb all of the information before the punchline. Creating this seesaw achieves three important things that are often overlooked:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Flow</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Anticipation</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Clarity</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Here comes the word smuggle. This is going to be more fiddly than the previous example. Look at this part of the joke (words to smuggle underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">C &ndash;  ‘You know when you go through airport security; they make everyone take their belts off? I like to put mine back on standing next to a beautiful <span class="underline">woman who’s doing the same thing</span>. That way…it looks like we’ve just had sex’. (2 / 7)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The reason this smuggle is going to be fiddly is because, to de-clutter this punchline, I’m going to completely reword the sentence I’m going to smuggle those words into (new words underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">D &ndash;  ‘You know when you go through airport security; they make everyone take their belts off, <span class="underline">and there’s an area where you put them back on</span>? I always stand next to a beautiful woman. That way…it looks like we’ve just had sex’. (2 / 7)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Look how succinct the last two sentences are, now that the bulk of the information has been smuggled into the first sentence. Please study this, because word smuggling can create a major difference for anyone hearing some punchlines for the first time. An extremely common problem that comedians often aren’t aware of, is that they’ll bounce an idea around until they become so familiar with the information in a joke or routine that it eventually becomes impossible for them to hear the final version the way their audience will. The result is a punchline that only the comedian and anyone they were with when they wrote it can understand. There are two ways to get around this problem:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Tell it to someone who didn’t hear any of the process leading up to the final version</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Go away for an hour, then come back and read it again</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">I often find that, by returning to a bit of new material an hour or two later, it’s suddenly easy to spot the flaws in it. Getting so close to an idea that you can no longer hear how your audience will hear it is one of the most common causes of a confusing punchline.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Going back to the airport joke, something else that’s also important happens in ‘D’. By having the word <i class="calibre3">‘woman’</i> immediately before a pause, it makes it impossible for that key word to get lost in a sea of information. A pause immediately after a key word helps to lodge that key word in an audience’s minds. So, not only is ‘D’ much punchier than ‘A’, it’s also clearer.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">This kind of detail is what separates the amateurs from the pros. Having a funny idea comes down to your natural talent and is the art, but a significant part of being a good comedian is having the ability to structure a line in the best way possible &ndash; and that’s a craft. So, don’t overlook the power of avoiding putting a key word in a sea of words. Remember, your audience haven’t heard your material before, and they certainly didn’t hear you bounce around twenty versions of it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Let’s carry on. Although the word <i class="calibre3">‘sex’</i> reads like a nice-sounding final word of a punchline, it’s actually not great. Say it out loud. It certainly isn’t a bad sound, but it actually fades out at the end (<i class="calibre3">‘…exxx’</i>). We can make three improvements by changing the last two words:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">E &ndash;  ‘That way…it looks like we’ve just done it’. (2 / 7)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here are the three improvements:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">The words ‘<i class="calibre3">done it’</i> land harder than <i class="calibre3">‘had sex’</i> because they’re both punchier words (especially said back-to-back)</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The joke is now cleaner (which suits my persona)</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The audience have to work out exactly what <i class="calibre3">‘it’</i> is, making the punchline slightly more cerebral</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">When it comes to the final word of a punchline, I’m certainly not trying to turn you into me. So, I should point out that you don’t have to use punchy final words. However, if you’re not going to do that, there should be some consistency to the type of sounds that you tend to use, and I believe that you should only use soft final words on punchlines if it suits your style of comedy. We’ll look at this a lot more in the chapter on flow.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Going back to the airport joke, the phrase ‘<i class="calibre3">just done it’</i> sounds like a playground boast, adding an innocence to it, which suits my persona. Below is the original version, followed by the final version. Sorry if this is starting to get repetitive. My agenda is to show you just how much detail can be added to a set-up or punchline. Look how much stronger the punchline is in the final version. Say them both out loud:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">Before:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘You know when you go through airport security; they make everyone take their belts off? I like to put mine back on standing next to a beautiful woman who’s doing the same thing, so it looks like we’ve just had sex’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">After:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘You know when you go through airport security; they make everyone take their belts off, and there’s an area where you put them back on? I always stand next to a beautiful woman. That way…it looks like we’ve just done it’. (2 / 7)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The final version of this joke is not only de-cluttered &ndash; it has anticipation, a seesaw and ends on punchier sounds. Most of this was possible because I smuggled two of the three bits of information from the punchline into the set-up. It started off as a thirty-one-syllable punchline and now the fiddly bit has been moved and reworded, allowing the punchline to be clear and punchy. If writing material from scratch is being an interior designer, word smuggling is doing feng shui.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now I want you to go over some of your new and existing material and trim it down. Imagine applying this much attention to detail to every set-up and punchline you ever come up with. Once it’s all tweaked and flows nicely, your material will instantly become tighter and punchier.</p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container">
          <img alt="" width="450" src="images/000009.jpeg" height="415" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">To reiterate, I suggest typing everything out the first few times you do it, because it’s easier to cut and paste words and check for things like seesaws and balloon pops. If you don’t have access to a computer, doing it on your phone is fine. Using pen and paper isn’t ideal, because of all the cutting and pasting. I much prefer to do it inside my head but there are no rules, and I know some good comedians who type out all their material word-for-word. Play around with different methods and then do whichever works best for you. This process may seem laborious, but I promise you that once you see things this way, it’ll start to happen inside your head instinctively whenever you imagine yourself saying a line out loud. Eventually, you won’t even have to type any of it out. I only wrote all that down to show you my entire thought process.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Whatever you do, please don’t read all of this without stopping. Treat it like it’s part of a course that you’re on and not like you’re reading a novel about a man who’s obsessed with words. The way I see it is, if you read an entire dictionary cover to cover, your vocabulary won’t double overnight, even though you’d have technically just learned over 100,000 new words.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="title-page-contributor-primary-block" id="calibre_link-92">
      <p class="first1">There’s a Shakespeare quote that pops into my head at least once a month &ndash; ‘Brevity is the soul of wit’. This sometimes causes me to have battles with myself because I want as much detail as possible to exist within everything I create, but I also want my lines to be as succinct as possible.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Whenever I watch comedy that’s neither succinct nor crammed with detail, I feel that the comedian is ripping their audience off. I’d say that the most useful exercise I’ve ever done when it comes to trimming down a joke is tweeting jokes on X, back when it was known as Twitter, back when a tweet was limited to 140 characters. It’s still useful as it is now (280 characters) &ndash; just with routines or very short stories. However, when it was limited to 140 characters, I very often couldn’t complete a joke because I’d run over by ten to fifteen characters, and yet it seemed that every word was vital. This is a problem you won’t face with stand-up, unless one routine or story is longer than your entire stage time, which is obviously extremely unlikely.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’ll give you an example of how I’d solve this problem by writing a set-up to a joke, deliberately not leaving enough space for the punchline. Since we’re going to pretend this is a tweet, all spaces and punctuation count as one character (character count in brackets):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I went night fishing recently and I caught the biggest fish I’ve ever seen. I didn’t get a photo as my phone died. So you’re going to have to take my word for it’ (161)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although there wouldn’t be a problem saying that onstage, I’ve gone over by twenty-one characters. Even if I trim it down by twenty-one characters, there still won’t be any space for a punchline. So, I have to do a lot of trimming down. I’m going to do this step-by-step, and my aim is to not lose any vital information in the process:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Last night I went fishing and caught the biggest fish ever, but my phone had died. So you’ll have to trust me’ (109)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This now gives me fifty-two more characters to use in the punchline &ndash; that’s a huge percentage of the original amount. So, what exactly have I done? There are three little changes with regard to making the same point with fewer characters, and they really add up over the entire tweet. However, let’s look at the significant change:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I didn’t get a photo as my phone died’ (37)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">changed to:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘but my phone had died’ (21)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’ve taken out any mention of a photo because it’s a given that, when someone catches a big fish, they take a photo of it. Plus, we’ve all experienced a phone battery running out. Since I had no choice but to trim the tweet down to make room for a punchline, I got rid of the part about taking a photo.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is exactly why X/Twitter is such good training for writing jokes. A lot of comedians focus on the detail in their punchlines, but overlook doing the same to their set-ups. I’m not suggesting every sentence you ever say onstage should be this succinct, but long, bland set-ups waste everyone’s time.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here are some reasons to justify using extra words:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">A:  </b>They allow your comedy to sound like spoken word (as opposed to written word)</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">B:</b>  They enhance any mental images</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">C:</b>  They create alliteration</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">D:</b>  They’re funny or nice-sounding words</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s imagine I’m going to say the trimmed-down version of the tweet about fishing onstage, and look at the original tweet to check to see if we’ve taken anything valuable away by trimming it down. Brevity may be the soul of wit but detail is important too, and if your comedy is conversational, I don’t want it to become so succinct that it lacks charm.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, let’s look at the original version and see if we’ve taken anything away:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I went night fishing recently and I caught the biggest fish I’ve ever seen. I didn’t get a photo as my phone died. So you’re going to have to take my word for it’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Of the list of reasons to justify using extra words, the only one that existed in the original tweet is ‘B’ (they enhance any mental images). So, did I do any damage to it?</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">Before:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I caught the biggest fish I’ve ever seen’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">After:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I caught the biggest fish ever’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s clearly no damage done, because both versions create exactly the same mental image: a very big fish. The new version is almost fifty percent shorter, and yet we haven’t lost a thing. Imagine that set-up is part of your one-hour show, and then imagine just how many redundant words you might be able to take out. Not only would that hour be much tighter, you’d realistically be able to add five to seven minutes of extra content as a result. That’s quite a thought, isn’t it?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s just like when you’re trying to save money in your daily life. Bringing a flask of coffee to work and making your own sandwiches five days a week really adds up over an entire year. To me, the comedians who bother to do this with their material stand out a mile.</p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container2">
          <img alt="" width="600" src="images/000010.jpeg" height="396" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">When I write face-to-face with a comedian, the most common problem I find is wordy set-ups that are unclear. So, that’s two problems. When I don’t fully understand the premise of someone’s joke or routine, I always ask them this one simple question:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">“What’s the point you want to make?”</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">As I’ve mentioned, comedians often get so close to their material &ndash; especially having just rewritten a bit a few times &ndash; that they can no longer hear it the way a complete stranger would. As simple as it may seem, asking yourself what the point is that you’re trying to make forces you to repeat a line using different words, and the beautiful thing is that your explanation of the point or idea you’re trying to get across often comes out as a better version of the original joke. It will probably need tweaking, but the result is often a much clearer joke.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is a bit like the way a therapist or life coach tells someone to ask themselves exactly what they want from life and then, once they know the answer, to ask themselves how they can achieve it. So, asking yourself exactly what you’re trying to say is an extremely useful tool for making a joke clearer. Don’t forget to then trim it down if it needs trimming down, and then make sure that it’s still clear.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you write at night, I suggest working right up until you go to sleep and then returning to your work the moment you wake up (ideally before turning your phone on). For decades, I’d always assumed that the phrase <i class="calibre3">‘Let me sleep on it’ </i>meant that you’ll think about things and get back to the other person the following day. However, it actually comes from the idea of allowing your subconscious to mull over things in your sleep, and I strongly believe that it can work wonders for your material. This is probably a result of a combination of your brain working in your sleep, and looking at something having had a break from it. Since learning this, I’ll often wake up and look at some new material I’d written the night before, and instantly see a way to improve it. So, you’re definitely missing out if you don’t return to work as soon as you wake up. It’s also a very positive way to start your day. It doesn’t have to involve writing just before you go to sleep and the second you wake up, but I’ve personally found this to be the most productive combination.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’d like to pause for a minute to talk about how all this might make you feel. Earlier, I mentioned you possibly stopping to question your own punchlines. Although doing this can result in instant improvements, I’m very conscious that the level of analysis that I’m applying can provoke self-doubt, and therefore risk becoming counterproductive. If your comedy is already working, it’s because you’re doing something right.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">As I’ve mentioned, my hobby is close-up magic and when I was in my late teens, my mentor was an extremely wise, old magician called Alan Alan. I idolised him. However, I’d often show him a card trick, and he’d shake his head and then verbally pull it apart in front of me, blinding me with science about what I was doing wrong. I’d often walk away wondering how anything I was doing fooled anyone because, although my card tricks were getting very good reactions from my friends, Alan Alan was talking like I wasn’t doing a single thing right.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The truth is that my magic fooled people because I was doing it <i class="calibre3">sufficiently</i> well. However, he eventually taught me to view things differently and, as a result, I went on to do everything better and move up to the next level. This is why it’s so important to me that you don’t lose confidence in your own methods. As I mentioned earlier, when I see comedians delivering badly structured punchlines, they still work &ndash; just not nearly as well as they could do. My main goal is to help you to take your comedy to the next level, and that certainly doesn’t mean dropping everything and starting again. It means looking at things differently and improving as a result.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s your homework to do now. I want you to type out at a bit of new or existing material that feels too wordy, and then ask yourself how it could be more succinct. If you don’t tell jokes, write out a wordy section of a story (not the entire story for now) and then copy and paste a version of it underneath it and get to work on trimming down the second copy. That way, you’ll not only be able to compare the final version to the original one, you can also start again by copying and pasting the original version rather than having to repeatedly click the ‘back’ button to start again.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Play around with it by deleting and replacing words and/or cutting and pasting sections to smuggle them into the set-up. Leave it in its final form, and then start again if you think it can be improved in a different way. Watch it gradually get shorter as you find ways to say the same thing in fewer and punchier words. It might take twenty minutes to get one punchline just right, but, once it’s perfect, it doesn’t ever have to change again.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now get to work and, when you’re finished, go to your favourite café and treat yourself to a coffee and a sandwich. Just don’t do it every day for a year.</p>

    <div class="title-page-contributor-primary-block" id="calibre_link-94">
      <p class="first1">You know that moment when you’re enjoying watching a film and the sponge cover of a boom mic slips into the top of your screen, and you think to yourself, <i class="calibre3">‘So, this is all just acting? That</i>’<i class="calibre3">s ruined it for me now’. </i>Of course it’s acting; it’s a film on a screen. You knew that from the moment the opening credits started. However, until that boom mic appeared, you’d almost forgotten it was a film because the acting, dialogue and set were so believable. By the way, the previous four chapters are all about my writing methods, and I’m aware how intense things might have got. So, the next two chapters are going to be about the performance side of stand-up. They’re no less important than the previous chapters, but will hopefully feel like a break from the intensity.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Often, a comedian will tell a beautifully crafted story and then, halfway through, say something like, <i class="calibre3">‘I did that joke in Birmingham once, and someone in the audience said…’</i> They’ll then quote something an audience member said at their gig. That’s exactly the same as a boom mic appearing on a screen.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">First of all, it wasn’t a joke to the audience; it was a line in a story. More importantly, until that moment everyone was just enjoying a story and, all of a sudden, they’re being dragged into a flashback about a time it was told before, and that forces the audience to realise that the experience they’ve just had wasn’t personal. So, no matter how funny that audience member was in Birmingham, is it really worth reminding your audience that you’ve just said something for the hundredth time, just to create one extra laugh? I’m always at the back of the room with my head in my hands. You may know that this story is full of jokes and that you’re telling it for the hundredth time, but your audiences generally don’t. Even the ones who do will still be suspending their disbelief that you’re talking to them and not reciting a monologue.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The way I see it, even the biggest comedy nerd on the planet who’s seen that bit of material before and can quote it word-for-word doesn’t need to be reminded of that fact. So, the people who haven’t seen it before certainly don’t. There’s no point whatsoever in reminding your audience that what you’re about to say is a recital, because no single laugh (or two or even three) will justify causing that big a ‘boom mic moment’. This isn’t so bad if you only tell one or two line jokes, but conversational comedians work so hard to make their material sound natural, so why risk ruining all of that with one comment?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There are comedians who deliberately and repeatedly create boom mic moments. For example, Stewart Lee has made an art form of deconstructing his comedy onstage and, when this happens, it feels like he’s asking his audience to hold the boom mic above his head. This is very different to having one or two boom mic moments during a conversational set, undoing all the magic that comedian has created.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I recently came up with a solution for when a comedian wants to share what an audience member once shouted out during a gig, <span class="underline">without</span> creating a boom mic moment. Before I explain it, I want to give you an example of a common boom mic moment that’s similar to the type I’ve drawn your attention to &ndash; when a radio show is pre-recorded (as opposed to live with a ten second delay). The host will be interviewing someone and the listeners are completely unaware that it’s pre-recorded &ndash; either because they don’t know, or because they’re so lost in the moment that they forget. Suddenly someone will swear and it gets beeped out. That one beep reveals that the show is pre-recorded. It would be so much better to either have a policy where people are asked not to swear, or edit out any swearing if it happens. The producer might think, <i class="calibre3">‘That was too good a line to cut out’.</i> Personally, I’d say that no line is worth reminding or revealing to your listeners (or viewers) that the entire show is not what it <i class="calibre3">should</i> feel like &ndash; a few strangers in their home, just having a chat.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Anyway, here’s the method. I created this when someone I was writing for desperately wanted to keep a funny heckle story in their show, despite it creating a major boom mic moment. Rather than doing the material and then revealing that it’s all been said before, present the <span class="underline">entire</span> story as you sharing what once happened at a gig. So, start by saying something like:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I got heckled at a gig recently’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Set the scene and then tell the story, quoting the heckle when you get to that part of the story. This way, there’s no boom mic moment because your audience is only ever aware that you’ve told that story once (the time you got heckled telling it). So, instead of going:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">Material  </i></b>→<b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">  Mention heckle  </i></b>→<b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">  Boom mic moment</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">Present it as:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">Begin story about a <span class="underline">previous</span> show  </i></b>→<b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">  Quote material  </i></b>→<b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">  Quote heckle</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Just don’t mention the word <i class="calibre3">‘material’</i> or you’re as good as back where you started. To clarify, it would go something like:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘My favourite ever heckle was in Birmingham. I was talking about my wedding day, and I said…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">TELL STORY UP UNTIL THE HECKLE.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Then someone shouted out…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">QUOTE HECKLE.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">By quoting yourself as well as the audience member, there isn’t a moment when you reveal that anything you’ve just said has been said since that day. This completely bypasses any boom mic moments and can be very useful.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’m certainly not suggesting that audiences have to think that your material is brand-new or even improvised, just that the magic is very often ruined when a comedian (particularly a conversational one) reminds their audience that the intimate moment they’ve created between themselves and their audience has happened before. It’s very common for a comedian to follow up the story about the heckle in Birmingham with:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘and then I came back with…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">…and then quote their witty response. So, not only was there a boom mic moment when they revealed that what they just said has been said many times before, their audience is now watching a supposedly witty person telling them about the time they were once witty. This doesn’t just come across as ungracious because it’s ultimately boasting, I also find myself thinking <i class="calibre3">‘You’ve got hundreds of people’s undivided attention, why can’t you be witty now?’</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Imagine being on a date with someone and it’s going very well. They invite you back to their place, put on some quiet music, pour two glasses of champagne and then show you photos of them kissing other people. It’s far from the perfect end to a romantic evening, and that’s exactly how I feel whenever a comedian tells an audience about how witty they once were the last time they told that story onstage.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Don’t forget that this often happens immediately after sticking a boom mic in their audience’s faces by pointing out that it wasn’t the intimate experience everyone assumed it was. So, even if both lines are greeted with huge laughs, when you see the bigger picture, they’re potentially doing a lot of harm.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Do you want your audiences to have an intimate experience with a funny person, or do you want them to feel like they’re watching a recital by someone who then boasts about the time they were apparently witty? Although, when done well and with the right emotion, <i class="calibre3">‘and then I said’</i> comedy can be very effective; when it fails, it’s often a result of the comedian not understanding their status, or not bothering to add enough emotion to the story. We’ll look at both these things later on.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look at a more subtle type of boom mic moment. Imagine asking someone in the front row of your audience if they want you to end your show by telling them about the first time you fell in love, or the time you got arrested for shoplifting in Turkey. It’s very likely that they’ll go for the second of the two options, and that your audience will respond positively to that choice by cheering. There’s a huge difference between you responding with:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘No one ever says “The first time I fell in love”’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">and:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘I had a feeling you’d say that’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The huge difference is that ‘A’ is a major boom mic moment and ‘B’ isn’t. To me, ‘A’ is as good as saying ‘<i class="calibre3">I’m about to recite some words that I’ve said onstage many times before’. </i>Both responses would probably be greeted with a big laugh and, although ‘A’ might result in a slightly bigger laugh than ‘B’, the damage caused by ‘A’ means it simply isn’t worth saying.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Unless you’re creating something meta, can you think of a single reason to remind your audience that you’re about to recite something &ndash; especially seconds after interacting with someone in the front row, making your show even more personal.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Very occasionally, a comedian will respond to my advice about tweaking a line to avoid creating a boom mic moment with <i class="calibre3">‘I know, but it works’.</i> The simple reason for that is because they won’t allow themselves to see past a laugh, and it’s extremely short-sighted. There’s so much more that can be achieved or not achieved in any given moment when an audience is laughing.</p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container2">
          <img alt="" width="600" src="images/000011.jpeg" height="307" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">Although I acknowledge that comedy can exist as a result of creating a boom mic moment, I’d say the least effective boom mic moment possible is when a comedian’s ego gets involved. Often, a punchline will completely fail and they’ll say something like:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘That usually gets a much bigger laugh’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The reason this is so damaging is because, not only has the comedian addressed a line not working without being funny, they’ve also reminded their audience that they’ve said that line several times before. I probably see this happen once every few weeks. At best, this kind of comment is greeted with a polite chuckle. So, in an attempt to protect their ego by blaming their audience for a joke failing, they’ve done two things:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Made their audience question themselves as an audience</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Reminded their audience that everything they’ve just said (and are about to say) has been said before</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Both these things are damaging. Unless you’re going to be funny when you acknowledge a line failing, it’s better to ignore the moment and move on. If you ever catch yourself so much as considering uttering the words <i class="calibre3">‘That usually gets a much bigger laugh’</i>,<i class="calibre3"> </i>I want you to see it from your audience’s perspective, and<i class="calibre3"> </i>imagine you’ve just made love to someone for the first time and they immediately point out that the sex wasn’t very good, and then put the used condom into a pedal bin next to their bed, only to reveal that it’s filled to the brim with used condoms. Yes, each of those condoms represents an audience that you’ve previously performed that bit of material for &ndash; and I hope that successfully puts you off ever saying it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s a mistake I often see character comedians make. Since they’re often presenting themselves as someone who isn’t consciously being funny, they should only ever react to a line failing in a way that suits their character, which generally means not reacting at all. When they comment on a line not working, it’s a contradiction because it reveals that they wanted to receive a laugh in response to something that was presented as a serious comment. Doing that creates a boom mic moment because they’re momentarily coming out of character by revealing their actual agenda &ndash; to make everyone laugh.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If part of you feels that I’m overthinking the impact of a boom mic moment, I’ll give you a good example of why I’m very confident that I’m not.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Years ago, Chris Rock brought out a special that was edited showing a mixture of the same show filmed in Britain, South Africa and the US, with him wearing different outfits on each stage, and the edit regularly cut between the three shows mid-sentence. It was very magical, and felt like we were in three countries at the same time. However, as outstanding as both his material and performance were, something affected my enjoyment of that show. The next day, my father-in-law said to me, <i class="calibre3">‘Have you heard of a comedian called Chris Rock? I watched a show of his last night that was cut between three different shows and it was word-for-word the same in all three shows, the entire way through’.</i> This apparently beautiful idea for a show had completely taken away any air of spontaneity that the outstanding comedy would have otherwise created for my father-in-law. Although Chris Rock had tweaked his show to perfection, I strongly feel that the audience at home shouldn’t constantly be reminded of that fact. There were literally dozens of boom mic moments.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’d like to look at the word <i class="calibre3">‘joke’.</i> Although I’ll be saying it hundreds of times, hearing a comedian refer to a punchline within a story or heartfelt monologue as a <i class="calibre3">‘joke’</i> has become a pet hate of mine. It may be a joke to the comedian, but, to their audience, it’s a funny sentence. This is all thanks to brilliant comedian, Simon Munnery. In 2006, I had a routine where one punchline often caused my audiences to say <i class="calibre3">‘Ooh!’</i> I knew it was coming, and would respond by breaking down the joke in front of them. My response was in the form of a rant that began with:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I’m the victim of that joke’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The rant was articulate, would be greeted with a big laugh, and I loved performing it. After one show, Munnery came up to me and said some very wise words:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">“You really shouldn’t refer to that line as a joke, because, until that moment, you were a funny person talking. The moment you refer to a line as a joke, you’re pushing your audience away for a second”.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">He was right. It may be a joke to me, but once it was crafted into a routine, it was the final sentence of a point that I’d just made. So, it <span class="underline">wasn’t</span> a joke. I’d created the illusion of having a conversation and then stuck a boom mic in the middle of it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, how do you manage to deconstruct a joke and make it seem like you haven’t just said one? From that day onwards, instead of referring to it as a <i class="calibre3">‘joke’</i>, I’d always say (change underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I’m the victim <span class="underline">there</span>’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">That way, I was referring to something I’d just said, so is a lot less damaging than referring to it as a <i class="calibre3">‘joke’.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">During my 2005 <i class="calibre3">Just for Laughs</i> TV gala, which included the rant that Munnery has since given me advice on, I not only referred to the same comment as being a<i class="calibre3"> ‘joke’</i>, I also did it with two other punchlines within a seven-minute set. To my audience, I was a funny person who was bouncing around the stage being funny and yet I was constantly reminding them that I actually was a comedian telling jokes. We’re always learning, and I was lucky enough to have Simon Munnery advise me not to refer to a line within a rant as a <i class="calibre3">‘joke’</i>, and I often wonder what else I could have learned if comedians had shared their thoughts with me.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Over the years, I’ve given a few hundred punchlines or tweaks to comedians when they’ve come offstage. Not because I’d rather work than enjoy a show, but because when I’m watching another comedian, unless it’s someone who operates on a higher plane than I do, I can’t switch off the writing part of my brain. Comedians have often given me lines and it’s always a joy to walk away from a gig with a gift.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Sometimes a comedian will tell a story about something that happened before, during or after another show. Unless you’re a character comedian (who isn’t playing the part of a comedian), <b class="calibre4">these are <span class="underline">not</span> boom mic moments, provided the story <span class="underline">doesn’t</span> mention material you’ve just said.</b> However, by reminding our audiences that we’re comedians (and therefore someone doing an act), are we no longer seen as funny, magical people? This is a battle I often have with myself. It feels like I become even more real by bringing my audience closer and inviting them behind the curtain and into my life as a funny person, which is why I’m happy doing it. This is similar to some episodes of <i class="calibre3">Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> when characters from<i class="calibre3"> Seinfeld </i>play themselves as the actors who play their characters in <i class="calibre3">Seinfeld. </i>It tricks the viewers’ brains into thinking it’s real, because the actors are no longer acting when they are of course still acting, just as themselves.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you’re a character comedian (who isn’t playing the part of a comedian), it seems obvious to me that you should never mention doing a gig because you’re asking your audience to suspend their disbelief that you’re not doing a gig. It’s very easy to avoid doing this, and yet I’ve seen it done so many times. They’ll say something like:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Unlike the other comedians tonight…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">or:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Do you know what I love about this gig?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Aargh! Major boom mic moments. Emo Philips wouldn’t dream of mentioning <i class="calibre3">‘doing a gig’</i> because he knows that it would destroy the illusion he’s created.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Let’s imagine you’re going to dress up as a member of the waiting staff at the venue you’re performing at, and you’ve written an entire set about your job there. Now let’s imagine you start your set by having the MC tell the audience that there’s about to be an important announcement. You then walk onstage and explain that the kitchen is on fire, followed by ten minutes of material about it. I hope you agree that the best joke in the world about the previous time you stood onstage talking about a fire in the kitchen is, in context, just about the worst thing you could possibly do and therefore overlooking that would be extremely short-sighted. Mathematicians often use exaggerated examples to illustrate a point and that’s exactly what I’ve just done. However, even when I’ve seen less extreme versions of that, it still ruins the magic the comedian has worked so hard to create.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Personally, I like to occasionally and momentarily analyse what’s just happened onstage, as if I’m reviewing my own gig as it’s happening. So, I’m okay with very occasionally using the word <i class="calibre3">‘joke’</i> as the audience’s nerdy new friend, who’s obsessing over a particular moment that’s just happened and I am sharing my thoughts with them. I’m happy doing this because it suits my persona. Regardless of how you approach things, I strongly suggest that you never refer to a line within a story as a <i class="calibre3">‘joke’</i>, because your audience is inevitably absorbed in a short film inside their minds. So, keep any boom mics well out of sight. Referring to something as a <i class="calibre3">‘joke’</i> doesn’t always imply that you’ve said it before, just that it’s a joke. It can be a joke that you’re saying for the first time, or even one that you’ve just thought of. You might say that they’re boom mic moments, which is a debate we can have if we ever meet. However, to me, they’re like a director’s commentary and I certainly know when to use them, and that’s never during a story or heartfelt monologue. I also know how often to do them, and that’s not three times within seven minutes, and I’d never refer to previously doing any material I’ve just done or am about to do. So, think this through with regard to your persona, because what’s right for one comedian can be hugely damaging for another.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There are some comedians who are clearly telling jokes and refer to them as such, and I love the boldness that comes with doing that. However, if you’re either a very conversational comedian or a character comedian (who isn’t playing the part of a comedian), a good approach is to present yourself as a magical person who just wandered into your audience’s lives, made them laugh and then disappeared. If it suits you to present yourself that way, here are some words that I believe subtly create boom mic moments that remind your audience that you’re actually doing an act, and these words are therefore worth avoiding:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Comedian</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Comedy</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Gig</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Joke</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Material</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Punchline</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Show</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Sold out</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Ticket</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">I’d say that using the word ‘<i class="calibre3">material’</i> is infinitely more damaging than the word <i class="calibre3">‘joke’</i>, and therefore wouldn’t ever say it &ndash; and I’d suggest that, unless you’re doing (or planning on doing) something meta, you don’t either. A joke is something that everyone is capable of coming up with in their daily lives, whereas <i class="calibre3">‘material’ </i>is something that you sit down to write. So, there’s a big difference between the two. Imagine you’re at a friend’s house, holding court and being funny. You certainly wouldn’t refer to a spontaneous comment or even prepared one (such as a line within a story) as ‘<i class="calibre3">material’.</i> This is why I strongly feel that so much as uttering that word onstage creates almost as big a boom mic moment as possible. To me, saying something like:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I came up with this next bit of material on my honeymoon’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">…is very damaging. When I see this kind of thing happen, I picture that comedian taking a vinyl record out of a sleeve, placing it on a turntable and everyone hearing the needle hitting that record. Funny people don’t recite, they just open their mouths and funny words come out.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’ve often seen comedians announce halfway through their set that they’re going to do some new material. Not only does this give away that everything they said prior to that moment has been said before, as soon as they’ve finished doing their new material, there’s a good chance that it’ll feel like they’re putting another record on a turntable.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">As subtle as they are, those nine words all have the potential to remind your audience that you’re performing comedy. So, if it suits you, you can do a lot more than avoid saying the words <i class="calibre3">‘joke’ </i>and<i class="calibre3"> ‘material’.</i> These words vary a lot with regard to how easily they’ll remind your audience that you’re a comedian and, depending on your persona, they will also vary from doing no harm whatsoever to potentially causing irreparable damage. If your aim is to make your audience get completely lost in the moment watching you, you could even go as far as to add four more words to the list of words to avoid saying, although these are all extreme examples:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Audience</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Laugh</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Microphone</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Stage</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">The reason I divided those thirteen words into two groups is because a magical, funny person making a comment about the microphone they’re holding is clearly infinitely less damaging than referring to the time they made that same comment about holding a microphone at another gig. Simply looking down at the thing you’re holding and saying something funny about it is a natural thing to do; I just wanted to draw your attention to all the things around you that you can potentially choose to ignore. I’m happy to use most of these thirteen words because they suit my persona. I want you to ask yourself; which of them suit yours?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The comedian who inspired me to start writing jokes when I was nineteen years old was Emo Philips, and seeing Harry Hill soon before my twenty-third birthday was what pushed me to do my first ever gig a few weeks later. I’ll be eternally grateful to them both for inspiring me. I can remember looking around the packed room of people screaming with laughter at Harry Hill, and thinking <i class="calibre3">‘I’d love to be able to make a roomful of people feel this good’.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although Emo and Harry are both masters at writing jokes, to their audiences they’re magical people, who just appear in their lives, share some obscure thoughts and stories with them, and then disappear. They’re inviting us into their worlds, and to fully achieve that, they don’t remind us that they’re comedians. I’ve only ever seen Harry allude to it twice in thirty years of watching him. So, he certainly doesn’t make a habit of it, and Emo would never mention being a comedian, because it would undo everything he’s just achieved.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">An audience getting lost in the moment watching a comedian being funny is just like watching a good film; they forget everything other than the fact that they’re being entertained. So, if you want to be seen as a weird or magical person and not a comedian doing jokes or routines, consider all the words on those two lists (certainly the first one), and ask yourself what the effect could be on your audiences when you use them. If a line of yours doesn’t need one of those words and it doesn’t feel right using it, replace it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s an example of adjusting a line to suit a comedian who wants to only be seen as a magical person:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I was doing a gig in Paris once and, afterwards, I was at my hotel…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">can simply be changed to:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I was in a hotel in Paris once…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This may seem painfully obvious, but it’s something I see happen quite often. Some comedians want their audiences to know that they’re successful enough to do shows abroad, but often this happens because it doesn’t occur to them that they don’t need to mention the gig. Personally, I would only ever mention doing a gig if what happened was relevant to that gig. Otherwise, I would just tell my audience that I was in Paris. If it doesn’t suit your persona to mention doing a gig, then <span class="underline">don’t</span>.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s a far more subtle example of a set-up that would benefit a comedian who wants to be seen as a magical person (changes underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘Don’t get me wrong, you seem like a lovely audience. It’s just that some of you are sitting a bit too close to the stage’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘Don’t get me wrong, you seem like lovely <span class="underline">people</span>. It’s just that some of you are sitting a bit too close to <span class="underline">me</span>’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">It makes sense that a magical person would be better off saying ‘B’. I wouldn’t describe ‘A’ as having two boom mic moments, and I would happily use that version. However, if you want to consistently come across as a magical person onstage (and that inevitably applies to character comedians), talking about your <i class="calibre3">‘audience’</i> or <i class="calibre3">‘the stage’</i> are both examples of subtly reminding an audience that they’re watching a performance.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">To conclude, isn’t it worth getting rid of any boom mic moments (if creating them doesn’t suit your persona) by tweaking or dropping lines if the result is everyone instantly benefitting from it? Hopefully, when this book comes out, it’ll lead to you coming up with lots of stronger material to replace the lines you drop.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">NOTE: That last sentence was a deliberate boom mic moment because this book is already out, it’s in your hand. If that sentence made you feel that something wasn’t right, that’s exactly what a boom mic moment feels like.</p>

      <p class="first1">Some academics who have put their minds to comedy believe that, if you search deep enough, every joke has a victim. I find this fascinating and, if that is the case, I’ve occasionally struggled to solve some of those puzzles. Although there’s no reason other than fun to attempt to solve that kind of puzzle, it is a very handy skill to have when it comes to deciding if something is in or out of character for you to say. As effective as it may be for some comedians to say brutal things that aren’t deserved (Jimmy Carr), if it doesn’t suit your persona to do that, ignoring that fact can have a detrimental effect on your audience’s impression of who you are. Regardless of your style of comedy, it’s important that you know who the victims of your jokes or stories are, because how cruel or compassionate you are at any given moment will always have an impact on how your audience perceives you, and constantly flipping between attitudes is very dangerous. My aim here is to make you fully aware of who the victims are in your jokes, routines or stories, because it’s extremely important that there’s at least some consistency to your style.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">A lot of inexperienced comedians will throw in an edgy joke here and there that their audience doesn’t respond well to, and they’ll wonder why a more experienced comedian got away with addressing a more controversial subject. The newer comedian will put it down to conviction &ndash; which certainly plays its part &ndash; but the key word is <i class="calibre3">‘subject’</i>. Once you understand the difference between subject matter and who the victim of a joke is, you can talk about anything &ndash; provided it’s in character for you to say it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There are comedians who are known for saying ‘the wrong thing’ and their audiences arrive at their shows knowing exactly what they’re going to get. Once a comedian reaches that stage in their career, the chances of an audience turning on them is infinitely smaller. However, what about the relatively unknown, more experienced comedians on the same bill as that new comedian, who are getting good reactions to edgy material? The difference is inevitably down to the experienced comedian asking themselves three important questions:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Who is the victim of the joke?</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Does the victim deserve it?</li>
        <li class="calibre6">If the victim doesn’t deserve it, does it suit my persona to say it?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">The fascinating thing about working out exactly who the victim of a joke is, and if that joke is deserved, is that an audience is capable of doing it in a split second. Although there are certain key words that can trigger some audience members (causing them to recoil), audiences can, as one, instantly decide if what you’ve said is justified. You’ll be amazed how much can happen in an audience’s minds within that split second between when they hear the final word of a punchline and when they laugh. This can often be as much as:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Making the cerebral journey to get a joke</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Picturing the mental image that getting the joke has created</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Deciding if it’s okay to laugh</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Occasionally, a huge laugh is followed by an <i class="calibre3">‘Ooh!’</i> from a large percentage of the audience because they realise they’ve just laughed at something they feel they shouldn’t have laughed at. I love these moments, because the comedian has hit their audience so hard that they didn’t have enough time to decide whether or not it was okay to laugh. So, they pass judgement after they’ve laughed.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">One of the most magical things about laughter is that it can happen out of our control, but that doesn’t mean people won’t try to stifle it if they feel they’ll be judged for laughing at the ‘wrong’ thing. Either way &ndash; and I find this beyond fascinating &ndash; an audience is generally capable of working out who the victim of a joke is within a split second, despite all the other things that are happening inside their heads at the same time.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Just like a flock of birds flying in formation, if an audience is big enough and everyone is sitting close enough to each other, they start to think as one. There’s some strange, magical thing in the air that unites them, and their brains collectively make an immediate democratic decision, as if they’re a jury that’s been rushed to announce a verdict. Since their brains have united, I believe that creates one giant brain, which is very powerful and therefore rarely unfair. I find it fascinating that a group of strangers can collectively work out who the victim of a joke is quicker than the person who wrote it. Although not everyone will have the same experience watching a comedian, an audience is still capable of thinking as one.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is why gigs where the audience is spread out across a room are inevitably tougher. I’ve performed at packed venues with a large aisle right down the middle of the room, dividing an audience into two groups. As a result, I’ve often found myself losing half of my audience. Given the endless combinations there are of the seating arrangement of 200 people, can you imagine what the odds are of all the ones who find a certain comedian funny sitting on one side of an aisle and all the ones who don’t find them funny sitting on the other? This is purely about collective energy either sweeping or not sweeping up a section of an audience, and it’s a fascinating thing to witness. I believe that, whenever this happens, it’s the comedian’s responsibility to reconnect the quieter section of the audience to that energy. This can be as simple as pointing out that noticeable divide. However, if doing that feels like a boom mic moment with regard to your persona, then simply asking the quieter section of the room a question or giving them constant eye contact can often be enough to get them back onboard.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">One large party within an audience can often think separately to the rest of the audience, creating a divide. Alcohol can also create a divide. You probably know that a few drinks will make an audience slightly more fun to perform to, and that too many drinks prevents them from processing thoughts quickly enough to appreciate more cerebral jokes. However, something even worse happens when too much alcohol is involved. Since not everyone will have had the same amount to drink, all the brains that usually join together to form one giant brain will cease to harmoniously coexist.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Going back to the victim of a joke, in 1998 I had a short joke about something that was very relevant at the time. It was successful with audiences, which surprised me as I was worried it would paint me in a bad light:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘You know those car stereos where you can take the face off to stop anyone stealing them? Wouldn’t it be good if you could do that with girlfriends?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">You experiencing that joke out of context might have evoked a negative emotion in you, and I’m sorry if that happened. However, I’m using this example for a specific reason. The first few times I performed that joke onstage, I couldn’t work out why no one so much as responded with an <i class="calibre3">‘Ooh!’</i> I’d always see women laughing just as much as the men.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Why was a line so seemingly controversial working so well almost every time? Then it hit me; I was admitting that I was worried about losing my girlfriend, and was therefore showing vulnerability. Not only did my audiences have to immediately decide if it was okay for them to laugh, they were also being offered a strong mental image. So, quite a lot was happening within a fraction of a second. Also, since the joke is in the form of a question as opposed to a statement, my audience was forced to ask themselves if they agreed.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Putting a short joke in the form of a question is a nice detail that’s worth considering. Within a split second, my audiences not only have to decide if it’s okay to laugh, they’re also picturing a person whose face has been removed. That’s not only what I call a ‘double punch’ (a cerebral connection and a strong mental image), it creates a momentary panic. Just to be clear, the cerebral connection happens when my audience connects the idea of removing the face from a car stereo and removing the face from a person and, as a result of that connection, they immediately get a strong mental image. We’ll look closer at double punches later on.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I remember playing around with different versions of the car stereo joke before I chose the version I ended up using, despite the final version being the one that first occurred to me. It was a very long time ago, but I believe I considered this version:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘You know those car stereos where you can take the face off to stop anyone stealing them? Wouldn’t it be good if you could do that with other things?…Like girlfriends’. </i>(14 / 3)</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you say ‘B’ out loud, you’ll hear that it doesn’t flow well. This is a good example of a bad seesaw because it’s so long at one end. Unless the original wording of a brand-new idea feels like a perfect punchline (which is rare), I’ll bounce it around inside my head until I’ve decided which is the best version. Once your brain gets used to doing this, it can take less than thirty seconds to try three or four versions of a joke. Unless you’re happy to risk giving your audience a weaker show, why wouldn’t you bounce your ideas around?</p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container2">
          <img alt="" width="600" src="images/000012.jpeg" height="414" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">A by-product of learning to process things that quickly is that, no matter how instinctively funny you are when it comes to forming funny sentences in your daily life, you’ll become even more likely to create perfectly formed punchlines when you’re improvising onstage. As I’ve mentioned, if you’re already getting good results, you’re doing something right. If you haven’t been onstage yet, please don’t put yourself under too much pressure for now &ndash; just be aware of what you should be working towards. I’m here to show you ways to zoom in on moments and improve them.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Your brain is like a group of muscles, and being a comedian means that you’re constantly giving one particular muscle a workout. I used to be able to add up and multiply numbers quickly, and ever since phones have had calculators on them, that muscle has weakened. Being onstage several times a week keeps your comedy muscle strong.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">As a funny child, you might have regularly created seesaws with perfect balloon pops that also ended on funny-sounding words when you were on the school bus home, but my aim is for it to happen every single time you write a joke, or say something off the top of your head onstage. Whether you’re bouncing around an idea for new material or interacting with your audience, natural talent merged with my methods should result in better comedy. I often take a half-baked idea onstage and it comes out fully formed the first time I say it in front of an audience because, being under the pressure of having the full attention of a room full of people, an extra muscle inside my brain suddenly kicks in. Adrenaline is an incredible tool.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When it comes to detail, an audience may not consciously see every flaw, but they’ll still know that they aren’t getting the best from that comedian. They might see the misdirection coming, or want to laugh three words before the end of a punchline because the information is in the wrong order. You don’t have to be a comedian to spot a lazy joke. Audiences will sense bad flow and even occasionally think <i class="calibre3">‘That could have been worded better’. </i>This is a good thing because it means that quality doesn’t go unnoticed, and I want you to embrace that fact. I’ve chatted to non-comedians after gigs a thousand times and am often pleasantly surprised by how much they’ve thought about what they just saw. So, don’t underestimate how much other people think about what you do. I can’t stress enough how much can happen within a split second in your audience’s collective mind. So, give them credit for being at least as intelligent as you. If you assume that the people who’ve paid to watch you are less intelligent than you, you’ll end up either writing weaker material, or intelligent, but badly structured material that you’ll blame your audience for not getting whenever it doesn’t work. We’ll look at both these things later on.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When it comes to understanding what happens at the moment a punchline hits your audience’s minds, I want you to see yourself as a sniper on a roof, taking out exactly who you want, when you want, and with only one shot. Don’t be someone waving a gun around, firing aimlessly.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Going back to the victim of a joke, when an experienced comedian makes their audience laugh by voicing a controversial opinion, a far less experienced comedian on the same bill might struggle to understand why they got very different reactions to their edgy material. Suddenly, the same audience will respond with <i class="calibre3">‘Ooh!’</i> to the newer comedian talking about running over a fox on the way to the gig. They might think to themselves ‘<i class="calibre3">How can a fox’s life be more valuable than a human being’s?’ </i>It’s this simple; did the fox do anything to deserve it? If the answer is ‘<i class="calibre3">No’</i>, then it’s obvious why the audience didn’t laugh. If the answer is <i class="calibre3">‘Yes’</i>, then that fox had better have done something awful, because people can’t stand animal cruelty. I’m not suggesting that audience members won’t have different opinions on any particular piece of material &ndash; they obviously will do, and that’s down to a combination of their taste and interpretation of a joke. In fact, it’s just about feasible that you could overhear someone walking away from a gig saying, <i class="calibre3">‘That first comedian was so offensive. He said that when he was at an airport, he wished he could have sex with anyone without their permission. Luckily, there was another comedian who talked about running over a fox, something they clearly didn’t mean’. </i>Fortunately, the vast majority of people don’t think that way.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Often, what seems like a brutal line will work because the victim isn’t actually who it appears to be. Soon after my marriage failed, I came up with this line within a routine on the subject. This is a perfect example of an audience’s giant brain working at high-speed:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘The downside to my divorce is that my wife is going to get main custody of my two children and, when that happened, I was suicidal. A friend of mine said “You can’t commit suicide. What if your wife dies soon after you?” and I thought, “God, you’re right…I wouldn’t wanna miss that”’. (3 / 7)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s honest, shows extreme vulnerability, has alliteration of nice-sounding words in the punchline that’s also a seesaw, and ends on a huge twist of expectation (I do realise how ungracious it is to point that out). Why didn’t anyone ever boo me for sharing such an awful thought? Partly because the twist comes out of nowhere and slaps my audience hard, partly because they sense that it’s probably a joke, but there are two main reasons why I get away with saying it:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">The fact that someone has taken my children away from me justifies my contempt for that person</li>
        <li class="calibre6">I come out of it looking foolish</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Since I have my audience’s empathy, they not only forgive me for sharing that thought, they sometimes even support me by cheering after they laugh. Is it sexist? Clearly not because a gay man could say exactly the same thing about an ex who’d just gained custody of their adopted child.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The second reason is the interesting one and is a vital part of why the joke is successful. Saying <i class="calibre3">‘God, you’re right’</i> is not only misdirection (because it suggests that I’ve fully absorbed my friend’s point), when I then reveal that I thought that they were advising me not to commit suicide for my own selfish reasons, it shows that I’ve foolishly misunderstood what was profound advice. So, I’m actually the main victim, if not the target. I realise that’s a lot to absorb, but please don’t overlook this as it’s an important point about understanding who the victim of a joke is. Look at the same punchline <span class="underline">without</span> the misunderstanding:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘A friend of mine said “You can’t commit suicide. What if your wife dies soon after you?” and I thought, “I wouldn’t wanna miss that”’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This version is far more brutal because I don’t lose in any way. Suddenly, I’m just sharing an awful thought that I’m aware that only I had. You might be thinking <i class="calibre3">‘Audiences can’t think that quickly’. </i>Not consciously, no. However, a lot happens on the punchline in ‘A’, and a combination of my audience having empathy for me and me sharing an awful thought because I <span class="underline">failed</span> to understand good advice makes it a double punch.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">What can we take from this? That revealing a flaw in yourself not only adds another layer to a punchline, it softens the blow to a cruel comment. A double punch not only makes a punchline more rewarding to process; in this case, it prevents a single punch from failing to work. I didn’t break that joke down because I like the sound of my own voice (if that were the case, this would be an audiobook), I wanted to show you that there can be more than one victim of a joke, and how much difference you being one of the victims can make to that joke. My instincts added the line <i class="calibre3">‘God, you’re right’</i>, but thinking it through is what made me decide to keep it there. This is why understanding your material gives you a huge advantage over comedians who don’t, you have full control. Oh, I’m pleased to say that the mother of my children and I are now friends.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I often see comedians deliver a great line and then, a few months later, word it in a slightly different way (the equivalent to ‘B’). The new version still works, just not as well &ndash; and for me, half of the beauty has suddenly gone. When this happens, I find myself politely explaining to the comedian why I liked the original version in the hope that they’ll change it back. We are all capable of forgetting the details we instinctively added to a line, and we sometimes need our peers to guide us back to our original train of thought.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Earlier, I mentioned that none of the examples I give of other people’s work will be from a male perspective. You might have noticed that both examples I’ve given of my own material are about relationships with women (the divorce and car stereo lines). I chose those lines on purpose to prove that a comedian can talk about anything, if they fully understand what they’re doing. The mere mention of the word <i class="calibre3">‘ex’</i> coming from a heterosexual, male comedian can cause some audience members to recoil, which is partly due to the huge amount of misogynistic comedy that many of us grew up listening to which, looking back, shouldn’t have been acceptable. Comedians can tackle this problem by either shying away from the topic, or facing it with the confidence that they fully understand what’s happening. With the exception of their first few lines, a comedian’s material is delivered to an audience who has warmed to them and trusts that they’re coming from a good place. This is what’s so unfair when a comedian who has recently caused offence to a handful of people at a live show is quoted in a newspaper the next day. Suddenly, thousands of people all over the country are shaking their heads as they read the line to themselves and then turn to the person next to them and say <i class="calibre3">‘Listen to this. Is this funny?’</i> I always think, <i class="calibre3">‘Not in print within a serious article and delivered over breakfast by you, no’.</i> Morning gigs are tough enough as it is.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Part of what makes comedy exciting is that it sometimes challenges you to laugh when you feel that you shouldn’t (Joan Rivers) and can often be thought-provoking (George Carlin) which means that not everyone is going to like it. If art is sanitised, it’s in danger of no longer being free speech, and that’s a huge part of what makes it art.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Occasionally, I’ll bring back a bit of very old material onstage when the mood suits me, and it can sometimes be greeted with a very different reaction to the one I’m used to. There might be a detail that doesn’t fit with the zeitgeist. Suddenly, I’ll get a judgemental <i class="calibre3">‘Ooh!’</i> where there didn’t used to be one. Do I back down and apologise? No. Just because the audience’s collective brain is bigger than mine, being triggered can unfairly influence its judgment. So, I confront them by addressing the tension in the room and, with immense conviction, challenge my audience as to why they were uncomfortable. This forces them to laugh at their own fear of the subject, and the tension immediately turns into good energy. I can do this because I’m high status, but it would be completely out of character for anyone who is low status. A low status comedian can still reprimand an audience, but they have to take control without appearing to be doing so. To quote Napoleon, be <i class="calibre3">‘an iron fist in a velvet glove’.</i> No matter how low your status is onstage, you still need to command an audience at all times, even if it appears that you’re not in control. Since I rely on confidence to command a room, I always watch in awe when I see an extremely gentle comedian take full control of an audience, especially a rowdy one. However, the common denominator is conviction.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Understanding who the victim of a joke is may seem like pulling a punchline apart for the sake of it, but when we get to the chapter on status, you’ll see why it’s important to have that skill. Once you know what to look for, it becomes very easy to work out who the victim is in any situation.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="title-page-contributor-primary-block" id="calibre_link-98">
      <p class="first1">We’ve looked briefly at double punches, but have you ever considered that a triple punch can exist, and how powerful that moment has the potential to be? When someone walks away from a show saying ‘<i class="calibre3">That comedian blew my mind’</i>, what they often mean is that the comedian not only made them laugh, they also filled their mind with thoughts, ideas and mental images that stimulated them to the point that their head was still spinning on the way home from the gig. What they probably don’t know is how many double and triple punches were involved. A comedian might have a great persona and lots of strong material, but wonder why some comedians are just that bit better than them. It’s very often down to how dense the other comedian’s material is. If a boxer can land three good punches in a row for every equally good punch from their opponent, it’s probably fair to say who’s going to get knocked out first. I’m going to demonstrate one triple punch and then show how, in the wrong hands, the same idea could have easily had far less impact.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When I was a new comedian, I saw Rich Hall doing a short routine that overloaded my senses and reaffirmed to me that his comedy is as good as stand-up gets. All I knew at the time was that it was brilliant, and I laughed. Let’s look at the joke:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘When I was a kid, every Christmas I would spend hours making my mom a present. One year, I wrapped her present up and put it under the tree. On Christmas Day, I handed it to her and she shook it and said, “Ooh, what is it?” (RICH LOOKS DEFLATED AND SAYS) “A picture of The Last Supper on an Etch A Sketch”’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">To me, this is a perfect punchline. Before we look at the three different punches, let’s look at the other things that are nice about this joke:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">The balloon pop happens on the final word</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It ends on a nice-sounding word</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">That’s certainly two nice details. Now let’s look at the three punches that happen simultaneously on that final word (let’s treat <i class="calibre3">‘Etch A Sketch’</i> as one word):</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">It’s cerebral as we have to make the connection between shaking a present and shaking an Etch A Sketch</li>
        <li class="calibre6">There’s emotion (empathy) since we know how much time and effort went into making it</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It creates a very strong mental image</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Not only is this a triple punch: since those punches are cerebral, emotional and visual, it stimulates three completely different parts of his audience’s brains at the same time. You could even argue that it’s a quadruple punch since Etch A Sketches are nostalgic<i class="calibre3">.</i> So, it has a perfect balloon pop: it’s cerebral, emotional, nostalgic, extremely visual, and ends on a funny-sounding word. Wow. Also, there couldn’t have been a better choice of drawing than Leonardo da Vinci’s painting of The Last Supper. It’s iconic, relevant to Christmas and, since there are thirteen people seated at the table, it clearly would have taken Rich a lot of time to create. Although it takes a good comic mind to make the connection between shaking a wrapped-up present and shaking an Etch A Sketch, it required Rich’s comic genius to create a triple punch that strong, and that’s exactly the kind of craft I want to draw your attention to.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I mentioned that, in the wrong hands, this joke could have had far less impact. So, let’s imagine that someone else had the exact same thought, but wasn’t aware of the idea of creating a triple punch. It might have ended up like this:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘When I was a kid, I bought my mom an Etch A Sketch for Christmas and drew a picture of The Last Supper on it. I wrapped it up and put it under the tree. On Christmas Day, I handed it to her and she shook it and said, “Ooh, what is it?”’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">If I’d seen someone do this version, I probably would have still found it funny. However, what’s wrong with it?</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">It loses the third punch since the mental image happens an entire sentence before the punchline</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The mental image of an Etch A Sketch is immediately followed by an image of someone wrapping it up and putting it under a tree, forcing the audience to stop thinking about the satisfying image</li>
        <li class="calibre6">There’s far less emotion as there isn’t any mention of the time and effort put into creating the drawing</li>
        <li class="calibre6">There’s a huge leak on the words <i class="calibre3">‘shook it’</i>, resulting in a smaller balloon pop</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It doesn’t end on a nice-sounding word</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">So, as funny as it may be to someone who only ever hears this version, it’s a far weaker joke. Even though it ends on a double punch (emotional and cerebral), both of those punches are far weaker than in the original version. The difference between these two versions is a perfect example of someone using their writing skills to turn a funny thought into a brilliant joke. A funny person had the idea, but the genius was in the writing.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look closer at this:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">The mental image of an Etch A Sketch is immediately followed by an image of someone wrapping it up and putting it under a tree, forcing the audience to stop thinking about the satisfying image</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">In Rich’s version, since the joke ends on a strong mental image, his audience can enjoy that image while they’re experiencing the triple punch, and he won’t move on to the next bit of material until they’ve finished laughing. So, nothing whatsoever clouds or takes away the beautiful mental image of The Last Supper on an Etch A Sketch. Failing to do this is a common mistake. If you structure your material so that any strong mental images are allowed to stay in your audience’s minds for a second or two rather than immediately be replaced with a weaker image, you’ll allow everyone to fully appreciate them. Even if they’re then followed by another strong mental image, it can sometimes result in the two fighting for attention. There’s a big difference between overloading an audience’s brains and confusing them, and the second can be avoided by putting yourself in the minds of your audience whenever you say a bit of material out loud to yourself.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s very effective if the last thing you say onstage creates a very strong mental image to leave your audience with. I have often seen comedians, including a few who I look up to, create incredibly strong mental images on the second-to-last punchline of their show and, although their final line is often equally strong, it doesn’t create a mental image. This means that their final joke has to start by competing with the mental image they’ve just put in their audience’s minds. Also, since it’s easier to remember a strong mental image than the wording of a joke, you can kill two birds with one stone by swapping the second-to-last line of a set or show with the closing line and ending on a strong mental image (assuming the lines work in either order). So, as a fine-tuned detail, it’s good to be aware of what you follow strong mental images with.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If it suits your style of comedy to overload your audience’s brains, the end of Rich Hall’s Etch A Sketch routine is what you should be aiming for when it comes to achieving that. Sometimes a comedian will attempt to create a dense punchline, but end up creating what I call a ‘negative double punch’. That’s when you overload your audience’s brains for all the wrong reasons, and leave them not quite knowing what happened. This can leave comedians under the delusion that their comedy is too clever for their audiences, when the real problem is a messy punchline. We’ll talk a lot more about this common problem in the chapter on ambiguity. Once you fully know what’s happening both in your material and in your audience’s minds, you’ll have a far greater chance of creating double, triple and even quadruple punches, and avoiding a negative punch.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Imagine if you created the first ever quintuple punch. If you did, it’s fair to say that that’s far more likely to happen if you were fully on top of things when you structured it. You might be instinctively crafting material brilliantly first time, but it’s such a useful skill to be able to fix a problem rather than hope for the best whenever you try out new material. If you double and triple punch your audience every two minutes, imagine how bland someone following you will seem if their set mostly involves endless, long set-ups and stories about them outwitting people in arguments, that also lack strong mental images or nice-sounding words.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">The average human brain is hungry for stimulation, and the people who are prepared to leave their homes to part with money solely to have their brains stimulated surely deserve to experience that. They may not know what a triple punch is, but they’ll certainly remember which comedians constantly filled their brains with happy explosions, and which ones gently punched them every sixty seconds without sharing a single original thought, nice turn of phrase, or exciting mental image. I’ve seen my methods rub off on at least twenty of the people I’ve written for, and it’s always a joy to witness, because it means that they took away far more than just the material I wrote or tweaked. It’s not enough for someone to say that they just saw a good comedian because there are thousands of them out there.</p>

      <p class="first1">This book could have been called ‘<i class="calibre3">The Difference Between Good and Great’</i> but, ironically, that wouldn’t be a good title. I want to focus on how much difference one word can make to a joke. I’m going to quote three perfect examples of this, and look at the difference that one word can make in each of them:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">Rita Rudner (dry, otherworldly)</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I could never kill. If I don’t like someone, I just crochet them something horrible’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I was in my late teens when I discovered Rita Rudner. I loved her succinct lines and unique persona. This line stuck with me and only now am I able to fully see exactly why it’s so strong. The word <i class="calibre3">‘crochet’</i> achieves four things:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">When you put a lot of time and effort into making someone a present, they feel obliged to make use of it</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It shows how much time and effort Rita is prepared to put into inconveniencing the other person</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It’s economical with words because it avoids having to mention an item of clothing or use the words <i class="calibre3">‘clothes’ </i>or<i class="calibre3"> ‘wear’</i></li>
        <li class="calibre6">It’s a nice-sounding word</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look how much weaker the same joke could have been if Rita hadn’t used that one word (changed words underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I could never kill. If I don’t like someone, I just <span class="underline">buy them a horrible item of clothing</span>’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This just about works as a joke, but none of the four things on that list apply to this version. I’d say the most significant thing that’s missing is this:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">When you put a lot of time and effort into making someone a present, they feel obliged to make use of it</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">If Rita had talked about buying people something horrible to wear, it would have probably left me thinking that the other person could simply not bother wearing it. Those brief moments of questioning a joke prevent us from laughing at it, and it can even be quite niggling when a comedian has overlooked that kind of detail, especially when it would have been easy to tweak the line.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is a perfect example of how a comedian who has mastered attention to detail will find that <span class="underline">one</span> word that turns a funny idea into a perfect joke.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Let’s look at another example:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">Noel James (playful, otherworldly)</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I was in a pub and I saw this guy with an eyepatch. Apparently, he was trying to give up eyes’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Noel came up with that line around the time that nicotine patches were invented, and a lot of comedians suddenly had material about them. My interpretation of that joke created a mental image of someone’s eyes gradually fading away as a result of having a patch on their arm, and that surreal moment is what elevates that joke to the highest level, in my opinion. Look how little effort it took to potentially cause so much to happen inside our minds.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The other thing that might have occurred to Noel to create a very similar joke would have been cabbage patches. However, as absurd as it would be to want to give up cabbages, the idea of wanting to give up eyes is far more absurd. Both are good jokes with double punches, but with the eyepatch version, Noel leaves his audience to come up with their own interpretation of what ‘giving up eyes’ would involve and, to me, that’s far more exciting.</p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container">
          <img alt="" width="450" src="images/000014.jpeg" height="415" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">Since comedy is subjective and you might have preferred the cabbage patch version, here’s a better example. Although some good comedians often have ideas that appear fully formed, they occasionally don’t. When this happens, they’ll no doubt tweak the line until it’s perfect. I was fortunate enough to see both versions of this joke:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">Tim Vine (silly, innocent)</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘I met this teenage goat and he had a human chin, because that’s quite fashionable for goats. I said “Ah…I see you’ve grown a blokey”’. (3 / 7)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I think this is a great line, and talking to a goat almost makes the line feel like it’s part of a fairytale. However, it took Tim changing one word to make it great. The first time I saw him perform it, it had a slightly different ending (changed word underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘I said “Ah…I see you’ve grown a <span class="underline">humie</span>”’. (3 / 7)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’m sure you agree that ‘A’ is far stronger than ‘B’ because <i class="calibre3">‘blokey’</i> rhymes with <i class="calibre3">‘goatee’. </i>So, he didn’t stop at good, he carried on until it was great.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s such a good feeling when a comedian suggests a nice tweak to a line of mine and it works. Two heads are better than one, which is why most sitcoms are written by more than one person. If you write all of your own material, something most comedians do, you can’t just wait for someone else to suggest a better way of wording a line. Instead, look closely at the details and try to improve everything you do. Some lines are perfect, but most things could be slightly better.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, if something works, it doesn’t mean that it can’t be improved and a comedian saying ‘<i class="calibre3">But, it works’</i> in response to someone suggesting a tweak to the wording of one of their lines is a very strong sign that that comedian isn’t looking for perfection. Those tweaks are there to be discovered, and those moments of discovery are a joy to experience. Finding that one word involves looking at an existing line, asking yourself why it’s funny, and then asking yourself what could make it funnier. I want you to go over lots of your own material and ask yourself if any of it is missing that one word.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look at how detail can make the difference between good, great and ingenious, as a result of a comedian continuing to mine for gold where most comedians would have stopped. Here’s one of my favourite routines by the comedian who changed my life in twenty minutes, Harry Hill. This routine has three stages:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">(Stage 1) ‘Imagine being given the news by your doctor…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">DOCTOR: We’ve done the tests and I’m afraid that you can’t produce tears.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">PATIENT ATTEMPTS TO CRY BY GURNING, BUT FAILS.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">DOCTOR: I thought you’d be upset.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">PATIENT (FRUSTRATED): I </i>am<i class="calibre3"> upset.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">(Stage 2) ‘But, I…I’m a tear donor. Once a month, I sit in a dark room and someone reads me a sad story…“Don’t sell the cow!” I then cry into a cup. My tears are taken away…I don’t see them again’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">(Stage 3) ‘But, I know, through my work as a tear donor, I’m able to bring…a little sadness into people’s lives’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This blew my mind when I first heard it and here’s why:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">Stage 1 (Good)</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">As playful, absurd and unique to Harry Hill’s style as this line is, it’s actually quite a simple joke. When people receive bad news, they cry. So, what happens if the bad news is that you can’t cry? It’s a cute joke, but Harry didn’t stop there.</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">Stage 2 (Great)</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Asking himself the question <i class="calibre3">‘What could you do to help people who can’t cry?’</i> and then coming up with the idea of donating your tears to them is taking this basic idea to another level. To me, this is a thing of beauty, and plenty of very good comedians might have been happy to leave the joke there, had they had the same idea. Harry carried on.</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">Stage 3 (Ingenious)</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although, for me ‘Stage 2’ is the most magical part of the routine, this is the part that left me in awe of Harry Hill’s ability as a writer. Arriving at the idea of being able to bring <i class="calibre3">‘a little sadness into people’s lives’</i> completes the routine perfectly, and only came from Harry mining further and further until he eventually found a third piece of gold.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">What can we take from this? That you shouldn’t pat yourself on the back when you think of something good, because you might be too busy celebrating to do something truly outstanding. Being good simply isn’t enough, and it’s your job to push yourself to find your genius. How will you reach your potential if you stop every time you do something good?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">This doesn’t only apply to joke-writing; there are extra stages to be explored within observations and stories. Once you realise that you’re capable of getting an idea past being good, your quality control bar will go up. I’ve seen comedians be average (in my opinion) for a few years and suddenly unlock something amazing, and become outstanding comedians almost overnight. It’s like they hit puberty and had a growth spurt. Mother Nature isn’t going to do that for you, and it certainly won’t happen by doing the same thing day in, day out, in the hope that you’ll improve.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Finally, there’s one specific type of detail that I want to look at. This is a method I’ve not once heard discussed, and yet it’s one of the most beautiful ways that a comedian can overload an audience’s brains. I call this creating a ‘retrospective punch’. A very skilful comedian will often place a detail in the set-up of a joke that can only be appreciated retrospectively, while their audience is enjoying the punchline. This is an unusual type of double punch because, for an audience to experience that extra punch, they have to be able to remember what happened in the set-up. A punchline that contains a retrospective punch will still work for anyone who misses that extra detail, because that detail is a little bonus for anyone who’s prepared to put a bit more work in when it comes to absorbing everything that’s just happened. When I watch a comedian add this kind of attention to detail, I get such a satisfying feeling because it feels like they’ve just handed me a gift without anyone else knowing.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’m going to fully explain the impact of a retrospective punch by studying a line within a routine by Emo Philips. This routine was within a longer story about the trouble he once got into as a child. Here’s the bit:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘I go to the psychologist. He says, “What does this inkblot look like to you?” I said, “It’s kind of embarrassing”. He said, “Everyone sees something silly; just tell me what the inkblot looks like to you”. I said, “Well, to me, it looks like standard pattern number three in the Rorschach series, the test for obsessive compulsiveness. You know, but…that’s just me”’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s one more line that follows it, but this is the part I want to focus on because it’s a perfect example of a retrospective punch. When I first saw Emo perform this routine, I remember laughing at the thought that he’d been to so many psychologists that he could recognise a specific Rorschach inkblot. However, the moment that excited me the most happened while I was laughing at that punchline, because it suddenly occurred to me that the <span class="underline">actual</span> reason he was embarrassed wasn’t because he’d seen something silly, but because he was uncomfortable revealing that he knew which inkblot it was. So, Emo saying that he’s embarrassed not only creates added misdirection (causing his audience to assume that he’s seen something silly) &ndash; it also sets up the retrospective extra punch. Planting detail in a set-up for your audience to notice while they’re laughing at the punchline is a major part of what separates outstanding comedians from the rest of them, which is why this is such a significant point. For an astute audience member, enjoying a retrospective punch is like holding a glass of fine whiskey under their nose, sipping it, and then closing their eyes and savouring the flavour.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s take away that beautiful detail (Emo saying <i class="calibre3">‘It’s kind of embarrassing’</i>):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘I go to the psychologist. He says, “What does this inkblot look like to you?” I said, “Well, to me, it looks like standard pattern number three in the Rorschach series, the test for obsessive compulsiveness. You know, but…that’s just me”’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is still a great joke, and that’s because the main joke hasn’t changed (apart from it lacking the misdirection). However, with ‘B’, there’s nothing extra for Emo’s audience to go back over and appreciate while they’re laughing at the punchline, which is exactly why retrospective punches are so effective.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">What I didn’t tell you was that spotting the retrospective punch in that line was the moment that inspired me to start writing jokes when I was nineteen years old. So, describing that moment to you was a very special experience for me.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">My tip for creating retrospective punches is to reverse engineer them wherever possible, by going over the set-ups to existing punchlines and asking yourself what can be added that won’t make sense until the punchline. This is similar to word smuggling, because you’re doing the work early on that your audience will benefit from seconds later. Although they’re not easy to create, I can certainly draw your attention to the fact that they exist. I can’t speak for other comedians when it comes to creating a perfect punchline, because I don’t know the journey their material went on for it to exist &ndash; but I do know that, despite lots of my short jokes being born in their final form, craft is a significant part of creating most of my material. I see the first stage of coming up with a bit of new material as taking a large paintbrush to a canvas and making instinctive, big strokes, and I see tweaking that material as taking a smaller brush and a magnifying glass and adding finer detail. No one has to know that you did the second part; they’ll just enjoy looking at a beautiful painting and, if anyone chooses to look closer, they’ll appreciate the extra effort you’ve made.</p>

    <div class="title-page-contributor-primary-block" id="calibre_link-102">
      <p class="first1">Tension is a comedian’s best friend and worst enemy, depending on how they react to it. There’s nothing more cringy than seeing an audience becoming uncomfortable, and the comedian onstage pretending it hasn’t happened and ploughing through the first minute of a routine or story to near-silence because their audience is so distracted by the tension in the room. That tension will usually eventually dissipate, allowing the performance to get back on track, but it’s a sloppy technique (or lack of technique) and is a classic sign of unskilled comedy. If you have an argument with a friend or partner during a night out, you don’t instantly carry on the ‘fun’ evening as if it didn’t happen; you clear things up first. I do know people who choose to ignore it and instead endure ten minutes of fake conversation with fake smiles, and that’s exactly what happens during a gig when you ignore bad energy, and a comedian certainly doesn’t have a spare ten minutes to get things back on track. I’ve seen so many professional comedians pretend an aggressive heckle that they’ve just dealt with didn’t happen, and carry on an upbeat story when we are all (including the comedian) thinking about what’s just happened. It’s very awkward for everyone, and should ultimately never happen. Instead, the comedian needs to learn to harness that tension and turn it into good energy before carrying on. I’ll show you an example of exactly how I do that soon.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If your style suits discussing taboos by name, that’s fine &ndash; but at least be aware of how it’s making your audience feel at any given moment. That way, if your next punchline is well-placed, you can hugely benefit from the tension you’ve just created by allowing it to pop on the next punchline. When done well, harnessing tension can be extremely effective, and the punchline that follows often results in an extra punch because the audience will release any tension the moment they laugh at that punchline. This technique is so much better than choosing to ignore what’s just happened and behaving like everything is going to plan. Who would want their gig to involve two minutes of discomfort, causing good lines to not get the laugh they truly deserve, when they could harness that discomfort and turn it into an explosive laugh? When it comes to moments of tension, a skilled comedian is like a conductor; they decide exactly how an orchestra responds to them, which is why fully understanding balloon pops is so important.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Tension can be created by a single word and, as a result, comedians tend to do one of two things: avoid that word, or let the audience sit out that tension until it leaves the room. I cannot stress enough how awkward the second one is to witness.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s a phrase amongst comedians: ‘word bingo’. It refers to when a specific word said onstage causes an audience to instantly recoil. So, just like someone hearing their final number being called in a bingo hall leaps up and shouts <i class="calibre3">‘Bingo!’ </i>some audience members hear a taboo word in a set-up that triggers them, and it causes them to stop fully listening to the punchline. It’s a shame when a comedian isn’t on top of a situation and this happens. As a result, some very good jokes can fail miserably. So, how do we get round that? Never mention anything that might cause a problem? Wouldn’t it be a shame to spend your entire career shying away from certain topics, resulting in you avoiding doing material, no matter how inoffensive that material may be to people? There are two simple ways around this:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Make sure that the bingo word is the final word of the punchline</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Harness that tension and turn it into good energy on the next punchline</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">If the bingo word is the final word of a punchline, an audience doesn’t have time to become tense as the joke is all over on the laugh.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look at ways to harness tension. Today’s audiences get triggered more than ever and, as a result, the current trend in comedy is that if any of the people mentioned within a comedian’s material happen to be, for example, gay, transgender, non-white, Muslim or from a country where the people have been the victim of xenophobic comments, that comedian will make their politics very clear at the start of the story. It makes perfect sense, because it relaxes audiences. However, it can come across as patronising. I’ve even heard a hugely successful comedian prefix a story about being in India with ‘<i class="calibre3">I loved it in India; they’re good people’.</i> No one said they weren’t. Personally, I’ve always felt that people are people. Either way, it came across as patronising, and could have been put so much better. So, comedians tend to either avoid certain topics, or make it crystal clear that they’re well-adjusted human beings before addressing them. If it suits your style to create tension, have you ever considered doing neither, and instead subtly using any tension created by mentioning certain topics to your advantage? You’ll be walking a very short tightrope that your audience will definitely sense. However, they won’t realise that you’re <span class="underline">also</span> aware that it’s happening. This subtle technique will create enough tension for everyone to benefit from on the next punchline.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’ll often apply this to boost a lull within a story. If you’re truly on top of how an audience thinks and feels, you should also be aware of the moments when they’re not feeling much at all. If there isn’t much atmosphere before a punchline, it will rely solely on the words in that punchline and, if it suits your style to create tension, I want you to give those moments a boost.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Another way to boost a lull is by adding funny or nice-sounding words, which I believe is the most overlooked technique in comedy. I grew up reading Dr. Seuss books and I’m here to keep his spirit alive, and that doesn’t mean running over a fox in socks. We’ll look at this in depth in the chapter on flow.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Since tension and flow can both be added anywhere, imagine what would otherwise be a lull in a long story having tension or nice-sounding words (or both). Every moment onstage is an opportunity to be entertaining. So, why not put the extra time in to make the most of those moments?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Staying on the topic of tension, let’s say you’re telling a story, and there’s a lull within a descriptive section of it. It’s very effective to slip in a detail that includes a word or ambiguous opinion that inevitably causes a bit of discomfort. This forces your audience to fully focus on what you’re about to say, in case they might have a problem with it. I call this method ‘tenting’ because, when done skilfully, it’s feels like someone’s just lit a match inside a tent. In the wrong hands, it might result in word bingo. However, when done skilfully, it causes audiences to worry slightly, and that builds suspense.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When I do this, nothing that offends will ever follow that suspense, and my audience have no idea that I’m aware that they just felt tense. So, when the punchline finally comes, not only has that suspense kept the energy up throughout what would have otherwise been a lull, there’s a much bigger balloon to pop on the next punchline. So, this technique not only adds an undercurrent of drama, the laugh that follows it is more explosive. We’ll look at an example of tenting in the next chapter.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">To reiterate, when I apply tenting, I don’t so much as allude to knowing that moment had ever existed. It’s designed to create tension that turns into good energy, and therefore I have nothing to gain from exposing my devious plan. For the audience, these moments are a lot like introducing a friend who swears a lot to a relative who you know can’t stand swearing. The two of them might be getting along beautifully, but you spend the entire time thinking <i class="calibre3">‘Please don’t swear, please don</i>’<i class="calibre3">t swear…’</i> The only difference is that, when done skilfully in stand-up, tenting results in an explosive laugh, due to an extra punch when the audience is relieved that the comedian hasn’t offended anyone. This is why doing it early on in your show is the most effective time to do it, as it happens before your audience feel that they know exactly who you are. Given that your audience can’t possibly know everything about you as a person from watching you onstage, they can’t be completely sure as to what kind of opinions you’ll have &ndash; certainly not in the first ten minutes of a gig.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I was once told by a psychologist that it’s believed by some people that, very often, the first time we ever laugh is as a baby in our parent’s arms. They’ll fondly bounce us up and down several times and then suddenly drop their arms far lower than before, making it seem like we’re falling. Our reaction is to momentarily panic and then, a split second later, laugh when we realise that everything’s okay. So, that laugh is purely a release of fear. As comedians, we can achieve the same thing using so many techniques, and the most subtle one I use is to throw in a topic that makes my audiences wonder if I’m about to offend them. The moment I seem to drop an audience is when they sense that they’re about to hear something they won’t like, and the moment I catch them is on the punchline when they realise that everything’s okay. That’s an extra punch, following tension that would have otherwise been a lull.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I feel sad when I think that so many comedians avoid certain topics in their material, especially when they wouldn’t be mocking anyone if they’d chosen to try those bits onstage. They’re basically scared of facing criticism, so are as good as being censored before they’ve even spoken. By doing this, they’re excluding certain groups from their material when we should all be feeling a sense of togetherness through comedy, especially when it’s performed live. Four comedians as part of a two-hour show all consciously avoiding mentioning certain groups in their material could result in those people feeling even more ostracised than before they came to that show, and that’s tension those comedians won’t ever know existed. If it doesn’t suit you to deliberately create tension, at least learn to conduct any that you inadvertently create and use it to your advantage. Those moments of tension are more balloons waiting to be popped.</p>

      <p class="subsq1">There are some words that I don’t want my audience hearing. In 2020, just after Lockdown 1, I saw a comedian MCing a gig to people on their first night out in months, and they said the word <i class="calibre3">‘COVID’</i> four times. I couldn’t believe my ears. After what felt like an eternity staying indoors and hearing that word fifty times a day, we were finally allowed to go out and be part of an audience and we’re hearing it four more times in the space of fifteen minutes. To me, it would be like them finding out that a couple in the front row were on their first night out since becoming parents, and then screaming in their ears and rubbing poo on their hands.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">My advice is to instead do one of these three things:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Completely avoid the word and instead allude to it</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Only use the word on a punchline (preferably the final word)</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Wherever possible, replace the word with a less triggering word or phrase (e.g. <i class="calibre3">‘during lockdown’</i>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Sometimes a line within a story will inevitably create tension whether you like it or not. If it suits your style to do so, then I obviously suggest that you harness that tension rather than allow it to linger awkwardly. However, if it doesn’t suit your style for there to be tension in the room, I suggest tweaking the line and reducing tension by using softer words or, if that fails, dropping the line. Although it can be great to have light and shade in your comedy, when a comedian unintentionally makes an audience feel uncomfortable, it clashes with the energy they’ve worked hard to create and always comes across as sloppy and is a sign that that comedian isn’t in control. Now we’re getting into the area of consistency of style, and we’ll look at this topic in detail in the chapter on finding your style of comedy.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s one more use of tension that I occasionally apply, and I call this method ‘running’. If a weak punchline that’s leading up to a stronger one follows enough tension to create a small laugh, comedians tend to allow that small laugh to happen. However, since it’s only a small laugh, I’ve found that not pausing long enough to allow the audience to release that tension results in that tension being held inside them until the next punchline, making the laugh on that second punchline twice as big. The reason the laugh is so big is because, not only are the two laughs combined, there’s also a build-up of tension from the first laugh that you have not allowed your audience to release. So, when I know that one of these moments is coming up, I run with that tension. When done well, it can literally stop an audience from breathing out until you allow them to. I often do this with as many as two lines in a row, creating one explosive laugh on the third punchline.</p>

      <p class="first1">Rolling energy is my phrase for when punchlines coast on the buzz in a room, and learning to both create and control rolling energy results in becoming a much better comedian. So, the method I’m about to describe is extremely useful.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">It once occurred to me that a short, strong, cerebral joke is at risk of failing if it’s introduced at the wrong moment, and I’ve worked out a close-to-bulletproof way of making sure that this type of punchline almost never fails, as well as a clear way to explain exactly how you can achieve that. This chapter is all about the energy in a room. So, if you’re very new to comedy or haven’t been onstage before, now is a good time to make notes.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s the method. I’ve noticed that some punchlines instantly put a buzz in a room when there isn’t one already, and some punchlines only work if there’s already a buzz in that room. I want you to see the first as a ball and the second as a cube. On a very smooth surface, if a ball is gently tapped it will roll for quite a distance, whereas if you gently tap a cube it will barely move. From now on, I want you to picture a crystal ball and a Rubik’s Cube on an ice rink, and that they are two feet apart. Tapping a stationary cube represents a small laugh (or even no laugh). If the ball is rolling fast towards the cube, when it hits it, the force of the ball will cause the cube to slide for a few feet, having been given the energy it needs (creating a big laugh).</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I see all punchlines as either balls or cubes, and it’s the cubes you need to watch out for. A ball can be introduced regardless of whether or not there’s energy in the room, because merely delivering that line will generate energy. However, if there’s no energy in the room, since tapping a cube will barely cause it to move, that cube must be hit hard by a ball.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">A common misconception amongst comedians is that a cerebral joke failing means that the audience didn’t get it. That can happen, but it’s far more likely that they either didn’t commit to it, or there was so little energy in the room that they got the joke, but the lack of energy meant that no laugh followed the moment they got it. An audience getting a clever joke and not laughing is often a sign that it’s a cube. So, if a room is buzzing and the audience is enjoying a comedian, that comedian should be able to do whatever material they want. However, if the atmosphere in that room is flat, the comedian shouldn’t introduce a cube until they’ve got the energy rolling. They <span class="underline">can</span> do, but it’s far more likely to fail than if it follows a ball.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Once you get used to seeing things this way, I’m confident that you’ll never introduce a cube when the energy in the room has either dipped or was never there. To fully achieve that, you need to get to know which bits of your material are cubes. Hopefully, some cubes have already sprung to mind based on your memory of short, cerebral jokes getting inconsistent reactions. Either way, here are some signs that a joke is a cube, and if a line of yours that isn’t working ticks several of these boxes, it’s almost certainly a cube:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">It’s cerebral</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It lacks emotion</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It doesn’t create tension</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It doesn’t create anticipation</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It doesn’t create a strong mental image</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Once you can spot a cube, you’ll treat it with the care it needs.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I once explained my ball and cube theory to a comedian friend and they politely asked, <i class="calibre3">‘Couldn’t you get the same point across by just saying that some jokes only work when you’ve ‘got’ your audience?’</i> No. An audience can be completely focused on you and enjoying your gig, but that alone isn’t always enough for a cube to work, because it’s all about the buzz in the room. Since working this out, I am infinitely less likely to have a short, strong, cerebral punchline fail. Occasionally, I’d make a wrong call onstage due to misjudging the energy in the room, and the first line or two of a routine or story will become sacrificial. That’s clearly not ideal, and it’s a shame to see good lines get little to no reaction. So, being able to gauge exactly when to bring a cube in is a beautiful thing, and is not to be confused with pandering to an audience’s taste (something we’ll discuss later on). It’s about getting the best reactions to the material you turned up intending to do.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">In 1997, I had a joke that would live or die on any given night at the same part of what I call an ‘A-to-Z set’ (a prepared show that’s delivered exactly as planned), and I just accepted that it was cerebral and not every audience was prepared to make the leap in their minds to get it. I now realise that simply wasn’t the case. Looking back, it depended on following rolling energy, because it was a classic cube. Let’s look at that joke:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I saw a nature documentary that said that there are creatures on this planet whose brains are so small they don’t even know that they exist…and I thought, that might explain why, when you catch some people’s eye, they say “What are you looking at?”’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This would get good reactions most of the time, but only chuckles and even silence the rest of the time. The exciting thing about this method is that it has close to a 100% hit rate once you understand why something is a cube, and how to treat it. Look at these four different ways of introducing a cube in the middle of a show:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A:  Lull  </i>→<i class="calibre3">  Cube</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B:  Cube  </i></b>→<b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">  Cube</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">C:  Ball  </i></b>→<b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">  Cube</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">D:  Ball  </i></b>→<b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">  Ball  </i></b>→<b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">  Cube</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Why would I ever apply ‘A’ and introduce my nature documentary joke during a lull? Being a classic cube, it simply wouldn’t create enough energy on its own, so would be a waste of a good line. It would create some energy, but it would ultimately be sacrificial. At best, it would create just enough energy to allow the next line to work.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you apply ‘B’, you’re at great risk of both lines being sacrificial. At best, the second cube might work, but you’ve still wasted the first one.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Applying ‘C’ obviously means that the cube gets pushed along nicely, which is great because that’s how cubes need to be treated.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look at ‘D’. Imagine there’s already energy in the room created by the first ball and you introduce another ball. That second ball coasts on the rolling energy, creating even more energy to push the cube along. ‘D’ is as good as infallible for introducing a cube and mustn’t be overlooked, because cubes can still fail during an okay gig. Once you start to think like this, you’ll soon find yourself standing at the back of a venue, watching a comedian begin a routine or story that you really like, and will as good as know that the first two lines are going to fail. Since energy and flow are both international languages, you can sometimes do it watching someone performing stand-up in a language you can’t understand a word of.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I don’t want you to feel put off by the science of it all. Every single one of my methods evolved organically. I didn’t ever sit down to work them out. The reason I’m reminding you of this is because, as you know, my aim is not for you to forget everything you know and start from scratch, but for my methods to slowly filter into your consciousness and eventually become as instinctive to you as they are to me. These methods will merge with the instincts that your own natural talent has already given you. It might happen overnight or it might take a while, but it will happen. As I’ve mentioned, I’ve trained people’s brains over the course of a few writing sessions and, despite them all having very different styles of comedy, applying my methods has significantly helped all of them. However, this doesn’t happen overnight; it sinks in gradually.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When an experienced driver is driving down a busy street and is surrounded by cars and road signs, they’re not staring at those signs one at a time the way a learner driver does. They’re absorbing everything as a whole. This is how it eventually gets once my methods have become part of your consciousness. Refusing to make any adjustments during your gig, such as waiting until the right moment to introduce a cube, can result in watching a short joke fail, or a story take an entire minute to build momentum, and that’s never ideal. Fully understanding and applying this method means that you’ll have the ability to avoid that problem. This approach not only has the potential to make sure that short, cerebral jokes always work, it can often allow you to resurrect material that you dropped because it didn’t work. Try it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I never find myself onstage thinking <i class="calibre3">‘Ball, cube, cube, ball’</i>. Sensing when a cube isn’t right for a specific moment becomes as instinctive as looking out of your window and thinking <i class="calibre3">‘Actually, I’d better put a coat on to go outside’. </i>If spontaneously deciding exactly when to introduce a bit of material seems intimidating, you can create self-contained rolling energy by making sure that your cubes <span class="underline">always</span> follow a ball, either within a collection of short jokes or within a routine or story. That way, as long as you’re at least having an okay gig, you won’t make a wrong call when it comes to introducing a cube. If you have a routine or story that contains a cube that’s hit and miss because it doesn’t follow rolling energy, I suggest creating a new ball that goes just before the cube by writing a bespoke line or two. When this happens it’s a truly beautiful moment, because you’ve just achieved two things: allowed a cube to work almost every time, and come up with some brand-new material.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">You might be thinking <i class="calibre3">‘I can’t just write a joke on tap’.</i> Coming up with a good line on the spot might be difficult to do, but since you already have a premise to hang it on, you might be pleasantly surprised by how easy being restricted makes it. I can assure you that I find it extremely hard to stare at a blank screen and come up with a strong, brand-new joke about anything. However, this isn’t a blank screen because you have to specifically write about the thing you’re already talking about and, since the line that follows your new line already works, that makes it even easier to do.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s an example of me realising that a punchline was a cube and creating a ball to place just before it. I recently did a brand-new routine about loving the idea of wokeness, but not liking the virtue signalling that’s often a by-product of it. Here’s the section of that brand-new routine that contained a classic cube. It’s quite wordy, as this is the version before I’d added extra punchlines to it:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I’ve got a friend in the States who’s a rapper, and he recently WhatsApp’d me a YouTube link to a rap battle. They were all brilliant, but I didn’t think that the winner was the best one. So, I replied “They were all good, but I thought the Asian guy was the best”. Do you know what he wrote back? “I don’t see color”. I looked at his text and I thought, “Do you know the only time I don’t see colour? When an American person writes the word…</i>color<i class="calibre3">”’.  (11/2)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s cerebral, has a nice rhythm to it, and guess what the reaction was? Complete silence. I asked a friend in the audience if they’d got the joke. They replied, <i class="calibre3">‘Yes, but it took me a moment’.</i> The reason that moment wasn’t followed by any laughter was because there was no energy in the room, and the joke certainly didn’t create any. At least some of the audience got the joke &ndash; possibly all of them &ndash; but an audience getting a good joke doesn’t always result in them laughing at it. This is something that so many comedians overlook, and is why I often hear them say things like <i class="calibre3">‘That audience didn’t get my new joke’</i>. I always think <i class="calibre3">‘How can you possibly know that?’</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Anyway, I tried the <i class="calibre3">‘I don’t see color’</i> line again with more passion. Still nothing. Deep down I knew it was a good joke, and soon realised that it was a classic cube and therefore needed a ball to push it along. Although it’s possible to spot a cube before you’ve even performed it, they’re a lot easier to spot once they’ve failed. So, let’s look at that list again. All five things pretty much apply:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">It’s cerebral</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It lacks emotion</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It doesn’t create tension</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It doesn’t create anticipation (just my audience wanting to know when I don’t see colour)</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It doesn’t create a strong mental image (just the word <i class="calibre3">‘color’</i> on a screen)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">I eventually solved the problem by writing a passionate rant to go before it. Quoting the line isn’t relevant; all that matters is that you know that it was emotional and created rolling energy. Not only did I create rolling energy to push the cube along, I also applied some tenting (like lighting a match inside a tent) that went just before introducing the brand-new ball (tenting underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Do you know what he wrote back? “I don’t see color”. <span class="underline">I’ve been demoted from a hip-hop fan to a bigot in five seconds, because I noticed an Asian bloke was Asian</span>’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The word <i class="calibre3">‘bigot’</i> instantly created a bit of tension, and the passionate monologue that followed turned that tension into good energy which created a very fast ball that pushed the cube through the moment between the audience getting the joke and them potentially not laughing. The result was a huge laugh as opposed to the complete silence I was used to getting for that line. It was exactly the same punchline as before; the only difference was that there was far more energy in the room when I delivered it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Just like a Buddhist thanks their enemies for allowing them to grow as a person, I was suddenly grateful that my original line about not seeing colour hadn’t been working, because it forced me to write two brand-new punchlines.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s such a shame to see good, cerebral lines end up being dropped. I’ve certainly given up on quite a few over the years, and I often hear comedians talk about doing it. So, next time you’ve written what feels like a strong cube but it doesn’t work, try not to blame your audience and instead put the work into creating rolling energy. The first two times I performed the ‘<i class="calibre3">I don’t see color’</i> line I started with no energy in the room, and the line added no energy to the room. It would have been so easy to drop the joke and walk away under the delusion that it was too cerebral for most audiences. Now that you can see what the joke lacked, isn’t blaming the audience a diabolical approach when the problem is far more likely to be something that the comedian has failed to do? We’ll talk more about blaming your audience later on.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If that line had still failed following rolling energy, I would have made it slightly less cerebral. One of my pet hates is comedians not crediting their audience for intelligence, and spelling out their punchlines through fear of them being too subtle. This not only inevitably makes the punchline wordier, it deprives their audience of the pleasure of making that cerebral leap to getting the joke. However, if that leap proves to be too big, then it’s time to make that leap slightly shorter. In this case, I would have tried this version (change underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I thought, “Do you know the only time I don’t see colour? When an American person <span class="underline">tries to</span> write the word… </i>colour<i class="calibre3">”’. (13/2)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although it’s not a great seesaw, this is a perfect example of meeting an audience halfway if a joke is too cerebral. Instead of fixing a joke by spelling it out, sometimes all it takes is to shorten the cerebral journey. If someone <i class="calibre3">‘tries to write’</i> a word, it implies that they’ve failed. So, by hinting at the UK/US spellings of the word <i class="calibre3">‘colour/color’</i>, I’ve gently nudged my audience’s minds in the right direction. A combination of adding rolling energy and making a line slightly less subtle can make an immense difference to a punchline.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Tweaking a joke is just like being a chef tasting the food they’re preparing and deciding to add a bit more salt. Sorry if I’m hammering this point into the ground, but it’s your job as a writer to find the best ingredients, and that requires mastering the craft that turns a funny idea into beautiful material. Not all comedy has to be subtle, but if your style of comedy suits having cerebral punchlines, that can only be fully achieved if you give your audience full credit for intelligence.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Not all comedy has to have rolling energy. If your style is laid back and a cerebral line isn’t working, rather than adding rolling energy, shorten that leap. I always start with a big leap and then make it shorter if needed. The reason I mentioned that there’s nothing wrong with unsubtle comedy is because, as you know, I’m not trying to turn you into me. However, comedians aiming for cerebral jokes and then spelling them out having not aimed for a bigger leap first, means that their comedy is at risk of being weaker and wordier than it could be.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Going back to energy, a comedian walks onstage to the energy they’re given, and from that moment until the moment they come offstage, assuming it suits their style to perform surrounded by high energy, it’s their job to intensify that energy or, at very least, keep it high. I’ll often hear comedians come offstage and say something like <i class="calibre3">‘They’re a bit quiet, aren’t they?’</i> This is a classic case of them protecting their ego. I’ve even heard that kind of comment followed up with <i class="calibre3">‘I hope they pick up in the second half’.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">All comedians know what it feels like to face a quiet audience and come offstage having failed to do much to lift the energy in the room, but performing in a flat room isn’t like watching a kettle slowly boil &ndash; you’re the electricity going into that kettle. Mastering how to connect with an audience and knowing exactly when to introduce a certain bit of material to lift the energy in the room is no less important a skill to have than being able to create strong material. Since this skill can only come with experience, if you’re new to being onstage, you have to put as much effort into getting stage-time as you do when it comes to creating material and experimenting with your style and persona.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There are some comedians with years of experience who don’t bother learning to control the energy in a room and, as a result, the success of their gigs is dictated by their audience’s mood on any given day.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now I want you to find a cube of yours &ndash; it can either be a short joke or a line within a routine or story &ndash; and try to find a way of pumping some excitement into the room just before you hit your audiences with it. Imagine how consistently stronger your gigs will be if you make cerebral lines work almost every time, rather than sitting through the quiet moments whenever they fail. Hopefully it’ll also result in you not dropping good lines. If you have any short jokes that are more clever than funny (classic cubes) that you’ve dropped because they weren’t working, I want you to give those lines another chance. Say them all out loud, including the lines just before them, and ask yourself if they’re getting the push they need. If they don’t follow a strong line, then make sure you deliver them after a ball &ndash; either an existing one, or one you write especially to go before it.  Suddenly one brand-new line allows an old line to exist, which is very economical.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Shuffling a bit of existing material around to make a cube work can be as rewarding as writing new material. So, if you sense that the energy is low before a cube, either move that cube to a place where it follows a ball or, if it’s within a routine, write a new line (a ball) to place just before that cube.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">Finally, here’s the best example I can possibly give you of how powerful rolling energy can be. Twice in my career, I’ve completely forgotten to do the routine earlier on in my gig that sets up a ‘callback’ later on. A callback is a generic term for when a comedian back-references a joke or moment from earlier in their show. When done skilfully (as opposed to just for the sake of mentioning something you’ve previously said), callbacks can be extremely effective. Anyway, here’s what happened.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The first of those two times, I was performing at a packed gig at a university, and it was going well. Then, out of nowhere, I said a very wordy punchline that made absolutely no sense to my audience, because I’d forgotten to do the routine earlier that set up the callback. Suddenly 300 students who’d been laughing for thirty minutes stared blankly at me. There was such a clunk in the room that I’ll never forget it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The reason I’m telling you this is because the other time I forgot to set up a callback, it was at the end of a positive, life-affirming speech which coasted on as much rolling energy as I’ve ever created. When I got to the callback that I’d forgotten to set up, at the peak of the rolling energy, the emotional punchline that made no sense whatsoever was greeted with as big a laugh as I was used to getting on that line. When I came off, a friend said to me, <i class="calibre3">‘You know you forgot to set up that callback, don’t you?’</i> I had no idea.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">What did this prove? That if you’re performing to a pumped-up audience that completely trusts you, a combination of conviction and rolling energy can still pop a huge balloon. The significant difference between those two stories is that the callback that resulted in silence was a cerebral punchline that followed low energy, and the one that resulted in a massive laugh was on the back of rolling energy &ndash; and that’s the difference between a ball and a cube.</p>

      <p class="first1">A topper (or ‘tag’) is when a punchline is immediately followed by another punchline, and is the single most economical way to take advantage of rolling energy to create laughter because, since the set-up is out of the way, you’re free to add another punchline that will instantly coast on the energy created by the previous punchline. Technically, a topper should result in a bigger laugh than the punchline it follows (hence the name). It’s fine if the two laughs back-to-back are similar, but if the second laugh is noticeably smaller it can feel anticlimactic, especially if it’s the final line of a routine or story. A killer topper that follows a killer topper to a killer punchline is a beautiful thing to witness and yet British comedians don’t tend to use toppers nearly as often as comedians from the US. There are a few American comedians (Scott Capurro just sprung to mind) who will have two or three toppers to several jokes in a row, which means that their audiences often spend as much time laughing as listening. At the <i class="calibre3">Just for Laughs</i> comedy festival in Montreal, where comedians generally only do seven-minute sets, I’ve noticed that the American comedians put the Brits to shame when it comes to laughs per minute. This is largely down to the amount of toppers they use. Since they’re more used to occasionally doing much shorter sets than British comedians are, they realise how important it is to cram as many punchlines into a short set as possible, as well as shaving off any redundant words. Although good set-ups will often create the necessary tension for a punchline or add lovely detail in the form of rich language or strong mental images, they’re often just the information needed to get to a punchline. So, from an audience’s perspective, even if a set-up is enjoyable, what could be better than hearing it being followed by several punchlines? When you compare a comedian delivering a rich set-up with three punchlines to one who delivers an extraneous set-up that’s followed by one punchline and then another extraneous set-up, isn’t it clear which comedian is likely to be the more exciting one to watch?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Earlier, we looked at trimming down a joke. Imagine adding as many as fifty percent more punchlines to a set or show. I’m about to explain how that’s possible. I need to give you a brief back-story first. I had my own BBC Radio 4 series from 2003-2005, which involved recording over five hours of content, ninety percent of which was brand-new. It was a daunting job. The existing ten percent had evolved over the previous decade, having started its journey when I was walking down the street, in conversation or onstage. The ‘powers that be’ at the BBC requested me to type out every single word of it for them to check over. The first time this happened, I sat at my laptop to face the laborious task of transcribing around five minutes of existing material that I’d said hundreds of times. However, something beautiful inadvertently happened. As I was typing out set-ups and punchlines that had only ever previously been spoken (as opposed to written down), toppers started occurring to me. What better time to think of a punchline than when you’re typing one out, and what better place for it to exist than immediately after an existing punchline? My material grew and there wasn’t a single new set-up in sight. I found that, by focusing on writing, it left me no choice but to think about my material and, once my mind wandered, new ideas came to me. By not being under the pressure of having to deliver my material onstage, it was suddenly presented to me in a new way. You must try this because, if it works for you,  you’ll have just found an incredibly useful writing method and it’s only laziness that’s stopping you from finding out.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Do it with at least ten minutes of material. If you only get one topper out of it, wouldn’t that still be worth the effort? If you get three or more and they all work the first time you perform them onstage, it’ll feel like you’ve got wings. If you can’t type quickly, try writing it down by hand in pencil (so you can erase and change bits) on a pad of A4 paper. Don’t put yourself under pressure to even think of new punchlines, just write out your existing stuff and see what happens. Since you know your material well, it’s easy for your mind to wander as you’re writing it down. If you’re doing this in preparation for your first ever gig, I suggest that, since you’ll be far less familiar with the material, you write it out at least twice in a row. At worst, this will help you to remember it. So, that’s two reasons to write it out more than once, making doing it very economical.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although I’m happy creating a punchline with two toppers (assuming they’re both strong lines), my record is five. Admittedly, I’ve only achieved that twice in thirty years, but hitting the fifth topper in row at a buzzing gig is such a good feeling. Both times, the routines grew organically onstage. I started off with one or two toppers and, over a few months, they grew to five. I don’t think I could sit down and write five toppers in one writing session. Maybe you’ll find that you can and that’s infinitely more likely to happen if you rewrite the same bit of material more than once. However, for me, it was a case of adding toppers by improvising around my existing toppers.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Once you’ve finished, take a break, go back and read it again, then try to shave some words off here and there. This is why it’s easier to type it out than do it inside your head. If you prefer to write it out by hand, remember to do it in pencil, so you can make changes. If you have a long story that you’d like to work on, it’ll be very economical because you can return to it later for another exercise at the end of the chapter on storytelling. Although I tend not to write any of my material down, just a few key words to jog my memory, being forced to write stuff out verbatim also showed me where the longer set-ups were, causing me to ponder on how I could get the same idea across in fewer words without losing any detail.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Imagine if twenty minutes of your material went from having thirty punchlines to forty overnight. It can be done, and hopefully I’ve just shown you how. Don’t make excuses not to bother. From an audience’s perspective, there’s nothing more boring than sitting through a long set-up that results in a half-laugh, no toppers, and then a complete change of topic resulting in another long set-up. This is why live stand-up can sometimes be greeted with the disdain that live music almost never evokes. If a song finishes at a live event and the audience didn’t enjoy it, they’ll still applaud &ndash; and the band soon moves on to the next one. When a comedian delivers a joke, their audience has to fully commit to ‘getting it’ for that joke to work and, when that commitment ends in disappointment, the audience is far more likely to be annoyed because they feel that the comedian just wasted their time. You might be thinking, <i class="calibre3">‘I tell stories, surely I’m allowed to take my time’.</i> Yes, at the parts where you’re setting the scene or building tension, but there’s nothing to stop you from punching it up.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although a story often takes longer to build than a joke, the truth is that brilliant storytellers are often so economical with words that they create more laughs per minute than some comedians who tell what they consider to be short jokes.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">Now, get writing, let your mind wander and see what happens. Remember not to put yourself under any pressure to come up with toppers, just focus on writing down existing material. I’d been doing stand-up for ten years before I stumbled across this method and it genuinely excites me to be able to share it. I’m probably about to sound like a motivational speaker, but every single stand-up routine, poem, rap, song, sketch, TV series and feature film began with someone who had a thought and ran with it. Just a thought.</p>

      <p class="first1">When I was around five years old, my mum read me Roger Hargreaves’ <i class="calibre3">Mr Greedy</i>. At one point in the book, there was a drawing of him cutting a small slice from a big cake. He then served himself the other ninety percent of the cake, leaving the small slice behind. I can remember being fascinated by the fact that I’d been misdirected. Not only had I been tricked into assuming that he was going to eat the small slice, the idea of putting the small slice aside rather than simply eating the entire cake was an extra detail for me to appreciate. It was no doubt my first ever experience of a double punch involving misdirection, and would explain why I can still vividly remember that moment over forty-five years later.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The reason I’m mentioning that childhood memory is because the extra detail for the reader to think about was the difference between a joke with a twist and a good joke with a twist. So, my aim when it comes to misdirecting an audience is to create spinoff thoughts on punchlines, not just misdirection. Don’t overlook this point, because the extra layer is very often what makes a twist brilliant, <span class="underline">not</span> the twist itself.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’ve mentioned my love of close-up magic. There are many parallels between comedy and magic, and misdirection is the most significant one. In both cases, the performer distracts their audience to prevent them from knowing what’s really happening. Here’s the subtle difference; if the misdirection in magic isn’t perfect, some of the audience might see the ‘move’ and, for those people, there’s no magic. In comedy, when an audience member senses a surprise that’s coming, they might still laugh &ndash; just not as hard. Basically, imperfect misdirection in comedy tends to still work, but with magic it risks completely failing. So, I came into comedy with the approach that a joke involving misdirection had to be airtight, otherwise there was no joke. Although that isn’t quite the case, just as tweeting funny ideas is a good exercise in trimming down a joke, magic is an equally effective discipline when it comes to making sure that no one sees the twist coming in a punchline.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s an example of a joke using misdirection that I came up with early on in my career:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Little tip. If you’ve got cats and you’re sick of being covered in cat hair, get some Sellotape…and wrap it around your cat’. </i>(5 / 7)</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s relatable, succinct and the punchline twists on the final syllable. It’s not a seesaw, but the misdirection more than makes up for that. This is a good example of a pause in a punchline working without a seesaw, because something else compensates for the lack of one. I’d rather there was one, but the twist in the joke is what makes it still land well.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s also a visual detail that makes it airtight. During the pause, I mime wrapping Sellotape around my hand, which of course turns out to be a cat. So, that adds visual misdirection. If your objective is to trick your audience, then all details to enhance that can make the joke stronger. So, think visually as well as verbally.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Something else happens a split second after the punchline in my cat joke other than the audience laughing at having just been tricked; they get a mental image of a cat wrapped in Sellotape. So, it’s a double punch (misdirection and mental image).</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I mentioned that I’d rather there was a seesaw. Unfortunately, the only way to achieve that would have weakened the joke (change underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘get some <span class="underline">tape</span>…and wrap it around your cat’. (3 / 7)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This ten-syllable punchline had misdirection and a seesaw. However, since the most vital detail is my audience thinking that they’re ahead of me, the word <i class="calibre3">‘Sellotape’</i> is far more important to the joke than a seesaw. If there was a famous brand of sticky tape with a one syllable name, the joke could have been improved. Trying to take two syllables out of a successful joke to improve its flow may seem like obsession to detail, but if you do this with your material, I can assure you that those details will really add up over an entire show. It took two minutes to try to add a seesaw to that joke and, although it ended up staying the same, I still explored my options. When a line using misdirection works, it rarely occurs to the comedian that it could be improved.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s an example of putting myself inside your mind as the reader and tweaking misdirection even though it didn’t appear to be needed, and I hope it helps you to do the same.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When I quoted the joke about Johnny Smells I had to remember the wording, as I hadn’t told it in around twenty years. It’s a simple joke but, as with any joke, it still deserves to be treated with care and attention. So, I thought about it. Look at the underlined words:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Well, did your parents change your name?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3"><span class="underline">JOHNNY</span> NODDED.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘<span class="underline">Great</span>, what is it now?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Benny Smells’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">As easy as it may seem to get this right, I originally wrote:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Well, did your parents change your name?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">HE NODDED.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘What is it now?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Benny Smells’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Both versions would work, but detail is important and, by saying ‘<i class="calibre3">Johnny’</i> just before ‘<i class="calibre3">Benny’</i>, it not only means that whoever you’re telling the joke to assumes his name is still Johnny (keeping the twist airtight), it creates an immediate contrast between us hearing his old name and his new one.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Also, the teacher saying ‘<i class="calibre3">Great, what is it now?’</i> (as opposed to just <i class="calibre3">‘What is it now?’</i>) not only reinforces the misdirection to the story because it suggests that we’re about to hear good news, it adds emotion. Since the teacher is pleased to hear that Johnny has changed his name, we share that emotion, adding even more impact to the punchline.</p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container">
          <img alt="" width="450" src="images/000018.jpeg" height="449" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">You can apply this to jokes, routines and stories by simply putting yourself in the minds of your audience and asking yourself what you want them to think and feel, and how you can tweak things to achieve that. I can spot lazy writing a mile off and, once I spot it, it’s likely to happen throughout someone’s set or show.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">This no doubt applies to all industries. The only other job I’ve had is cocktail bartender, and I often see people make as many as four mistakes while pouring and handing me a gin and tonic. That’s more mistakes than there are words in the name of the drink. This is why I added a caveat about the way I word things here, because I only claim to be able to do three things well: write and perform stand-up and make cocktails.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I obviously don’t remember exactly how my dad told that joke at the time, but I do know that those details collectively made enough of a difference for me to be glad that I thought it through. Don’t ever overlook detail.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">You might be thinking <i class="calibre3">‘If people laugh at both versions, surely either one will do’.</i> It’s about making something airtight. Let’s imagine I told the pre-tweaked version of the Johnny Smells joke onstage and everyone laughed. Some of those people might have seen the punchline coming but still enjoyed it. For those people, the punchline has a smaller impact. So, by simply adding the details, <i class="calibre3">‘Johnny nodded’ </i>and<i class="calibre3"> ‘Great, what is it now?’</i>, it helps to prevent that from happening, making it stronger.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The most blinkered approach a comedian can take to someone suggesting a tweak to one of their lines is to reply <i class="calibre3">‘But, it works’</i>.<i class="calibre3"> </i>Yes, but is it perfect? Whenever you tell a story, you’re showing your audience a very short film, and the best thing about making that film is that it doesn’t require any budget to retake a scene at a later date. So, do retakes until the misdirection doesn’t just work, it’s perfect. That freedom obviously applies to every bit of your material. After all, it’s not like you wrote a book and then spotted a typo just after it was published (wink).</p>

      <p class="first1">When I was a new comedian, someone gave me the worst advice I’ve ever been given. I was in a busy dressing-room, and I was talking about striving for originality. A more experienced comedian turned to me and said, <i class="calibre3">‘There’s only one type of laugh, Adam’. </i>It was said in a fatherly way and with good intentions, but they really didn’t know what they were talking about and I desperately don’t want you to take that approach. Just like colours of a rainbow, there are many types of laughs and there’s certainly every reason to be as original as possible when you set out to get them.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Not only are there many types of laughs, we get very different feelings when we experience each of them. Joan Rivers would often cause the type of laugh where her audience is slightly shocked and sometimes even feel they shouldn’t laugh, whereas Tim Vine brings out the child in you and his infectious joy of life makes you feel good to be alive. Those two comedians’ styles of laughs couldn’t be more different, yet they’re both just as satisfying to me. The one you don’t want is a knee-jerk laugh, because it’s comedy with no substance and nothing to remember you by.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Harry Hill’s stand-up is the epitome of originality and he went on to become a household name, and is also immensely respected by his peers. What more could you want? As talented and well-meaning as the comedian was who gave me that advice, they sadly didn’t ever get past doing twenty-minute sets in clubs, and when they took a show to The Edinburgh Festival their reviews were consistently poor. They weren’t an artist; they were a crowd-pleaser, and that was no doubt what caused them to conclude that there’s only one type of laugh. Suggesting that there’s only one type of laugh is like eating cardboard &ndash; feeling full up, and concluding that there’s only one type of nutrition.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">One of the greatest pleasures that life has to offer for me is watching a comedian who operates on a higher plane than I do. Extreme originality combined with a charisma that’s larger than life leaves me unaware of any mechanics beneath the surface, and I regress to being five-year-old me, hearing my first joke. There’s no science to being a one-off, but aspiring to be as original as your heroes by reminding yourself how high their quality bar is would be a very good approach.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">We all want to see our audiences roaring with laughter, but the quality of the material getting those laughs is more important. I say <i class="calibre3">‘more’</i> because some of my favourite comedians sometimes have the most gentle gig of the night, but the laughs are richer because you can almost hear the audience’s brains absorbing the extra details such as stronger visual images, beautiful use of language, and subtle layers to a punchline that are there to be discovered &ndash; but only if the audience is prepared to look for them. Comedy doesn’t have to make you howl with laughter all the time; it can be poetically beautiful, and allows you to take home something far more memorable than comedy that tricks you into believing that you’re watching someone being witty. Yes, there are cheap tricks out there. I call this ‘virtual comedy’, and later on there’ll be an entire chapter dedicated to avoiding it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">What type of laughs do you get, and are you consistently getting them? What style of comedy could you focus on to suit your persona? Many good comedians have two main styles and occasionally surprise us by jumping to a third one that momentarily clashes with their main two, but works for that very reason. They’ll then jump back to one of their main two styles and, subconsciously, their audience is fully aware of what those main styles are.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The best example I can give of a comedian doing this well is Dave Chappelle. If you watch any of his Netflix specials (which are predominantly masterclasses in stand-up) and look out for it, you’ll notice just how often he ends a philosophical routine or moving story with a sudden graphic sexual image. He knows he can’t do this too often or we’ll see it coming, but trust me &ndash; that pattern is very much there. Chappelle’s stories are very often poignant and, at times, even educational. So, he makes a sudden shift from one of his two main styles to his third style that clashes with his main two:</p>
      <p class="subsq1">1. Anecdotal</p>
      <p class="subsq1">2. Philosophical</p>
      <p class="subsq1">3. Crude</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Notice that ‘1’ &amp; ‘2’ complement each other and ‘3’ appears to clash with them both, which is exactly why Chappelle makes that contrast work for him. He uses the first two in perfect harmony, being philosophical within his stories, and then uses being crude to occasionally create a contrast at the end of a routine or story. I call this method ‘clashing’, and it’s very effective when done well. To reiterate, doing it too often risks losing impact.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">What are your main two styles? If you don’t know yet, that’s fine &ndash; but it’s very important to think about it and get them down to two (no more than three), and possibly another one that clashes with them. Like most things, this certainly isn’t a rule, just a pattern. Things don’t have to be rigid, but too many styles will inevitably result in a messy end product, leaving your audience not knowing who you are.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Assuming you don’t only have one style (which is very unlikely), when it comes to styles, comedians fit into one of three categories:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">A:</b>  Their main styles work well together</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">B:</b>  They’re using too many styles</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">C:</b>  Their main styles don’t work well together</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Have a think about which of these apply to you. If it’s ‘B’, we definitely need to address this by culling at least one style. Write your styles down if you can, and work out what could be dropped. You probably don’t want to have a show crammed with a mix of these styles:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Observational</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Satire</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Surrealism</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Puns</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Although that list may look like a complete mess, the reason I said that you <i class="calibre3">‘probably’</i> don’t want to have a show crammed with a mix of these styles is because rules are made to be broken, and I certainly don’t want to discourage you from successfully doing that. As I mentioned, things don’t have to be rigid, but if your list looks like the one above and you haven’t thought about why, it’s very possible that it isn’t going to work out. Just like with popping balloons mid-sentence, you need to know exactly why you’re doing it. I’m just offering a guideline that might be very useful. The reason I’m pointing out that many good comedians have two main styles and a third one that clashes with their main two is to help you tweak things if what you’re doing isn’t quite working for you. I’m certainly not telling you what you have to do.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">As for ‘C’ (styles that don’t work well together), unless you’re aiming for a constant juxtaposition of the two which can work, but will put you at great risk of becoming predictable, your main two styles need to complement each other in some way. Otherwise, you’ll risk coming out of character without realising because, very often, one style can be damaging to the other. Light and shade is fine, provided that contrast doesn’t make anything you’ve previously said (or are about to say) seem wrong coming from you.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Imagine watching a comedian talking about their views on the Prime Minister’s recent decision on something, and immediately follow it up by telling a story about the time their head fell off. You can of course do whatever you want, but if you go for extremes such as that example, you really need to be fully aware of this and be on top of those shifts.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">An example of a comedian who skilfully broke this ‘rule’ was Sean Lock. He would manage to go from doing a routine that’s based on a genuine opinion to gradually telling a fantastical story that was inspired by his original train of thought. He built what I call ‘reality bridges’ &ndash; a gradual change from being in a believable place and then merging into fantasy without there being a noticeable join. His audiences didn’t notice the change in worlds because it happened gradually while they were being hypnotised by beautiful stories, mental images and inventive ideas. He certainly wouldn’t have started a routine based on an opinion he had about a social issue and then have his head fall off thirty seconds into the routine, because his audience would notice the shift.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Having two main styles that don’t complement each other is like playing roulette and spending the entire evening betting on red and black at the same time &ndash; nothing good will come of it. It would make so much more sense for that comedian to replace their secondary style with one that complements their first style, and then explore the harmony between the two. By playing around with mixing styles that suit you, you might even find something that no one has ever done before. I’ve seen dozens of combinations of styles work, and many fail.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Observational and clowning is a classic successful mix because a comedian can make an observation about everyday life and then apply clowning as they act out that observation. Maybe you’ll create a mix of styles that shouldn’t work but does, and as a result, your comedy will feel unique to anyone watching you. This can, and has, been done. Character comedian Neil Hamburger is a prime example of someone who’s achieved this. We’ll look at exactly how in a few minutes.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There are combinations of styles that I don’t believe I’ve ever seen a comedian focus on. For example, a mix of shock comedy (Jim Jefferies) and clowning (Lee Evans) appears to clash as a comedian’s main two styles, but that’s what’s potentially so exciting about that thought because it’s there for someone to make work for them.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although I’m not mad on comedians constantly juxtaposing one style with another throughout their entire gig (e.g. flipping from crude to heartfelt and back again), there are bound to be exceptions, and I have seen it done with panache.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I once saw a new comedian doing really well-written, well-performed, upbeat comedy songs and then halfway through her set she paused for quite a few seconds, forcing suspense to hang in the air, and then told a gentle story about her pet cat dying. The energy shift was clearly deliberate, and she played with it beautifully, forcing the audience’s mood to change. The story was touching, memorable and, as soon as she finished it, she paused for a few seconds and then created a huge laugh by abruptly starting another upbeat song. So, there were two sudden gear changes: one when she began the sad story, and another one when she went back to singing another upbeat song. It was beautiful because she conducted the energy so well and we had no choice but to go from happy to sad and back to happy again. The story was out of character and everyone could see the formula, but we loved it. My conclusion is that doing something simple brilliantly still makes it brilliant, just make sure that the content and performance are more memorable than the obvious formula involved.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Neil Hamburger is one of my favourite comedians ever and is the creation of Gregg Turkington. He plays a bitter lounge comedian with greasy hair, dressed in a tuxedo. He combines traditional <i class="calibre3">‘What do you get when you cross…?’ </i>type set-ups with contemporary subject matter, very often resulting in shocking or controversial punchlines. This specific juxtaposition of traditional set-ups with crass or shocking punchlines is something that I’ve only ever seen him create, and it works beautifully. In fact, it’s so effective that he manages to keep his audiences guessing, despite predominantly only having one main style, and I’d say he’s the exception that proves the rule when it comes to doing that and managing to make it work. Tim Vine may be known for relentless puns, but if you watch him closely, you’ll notice that he also does a lot of jokes that aren’t puns (the ‘nuisance phone call’ joke for example). Plus, he occasionally performs songs to break up the relentlessness of short jokes. However, he’s always playful and innocent.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I want you to fully think about which are your main two styles and think for a few minutes about if they complement each other. Also ask yourself if they work for you with regard to how your audiences perceive you. Even talk to a friend who’s seen you perform stand-up (if you have done) and ask them how they’d describe your persona. If these things seem to work in harmony, that’s wonderful. However, if they don’t, you might have found a problem. This is easy to solve if you’re prepared to work on it. I suggest focusing on a new second style, coming up with one or two lines in that style and testing the two out together to see if they complement each other. I know it’s brutal, but if you want to improve as a comedian you can’t keep doing the same thing wrong and expect to grow.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you’ve been doing stand-up for a while, a good method is to commit a five-minute section of one gig to not using any material that’s in your second style, and see if things feel more natural without it. That could give you a very good idea if things need changing without having to first write loads of new material. Finding my voice was without a doubt the most exciting stage of my first few years as a comedian. So, if you’re in this situation, embrace it rather than see it as a problem.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Whenever I come up with a line that really isn’t in my voice, it’s so tempting to try it onstage to see if it still works, but it’s important to remember that a joke working for two seconds doesn’t mean you’re benefitting from it for the rest of your gig. Basically, you can win the battle, but not the war. I’ll often try to make a line work for me by taking the seed of the idea and bouncing it around for a bit in the hope that a slightly different version appears that feels right. I’ll even completely rewrite a line to adjust my status. We’ll look closely at my method for doing this in the chapter on status. If it still feels that a bit of material is out of character, then I’ll offer it to a comedian friend whose persona it suits.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I remember seeing Bill Hicks doing a pun about pigeons. It worked purely because it was out of character in a show that was fuelled by his passionate opinions on life. However, he certainly didn’t do more puns in that show as that would have given his audience the wrong message as to what his main styles were.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although there are dozens of types of laughs, all laughter can actually be put into two main groups: <i class="calibre3">recognition</i> and <i class="calibre3">surprise</i>:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">Recognition - “I relate to that”.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">Surprise - “I didn’t see that coming”.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although we still experience surprise when we hear an observation because we didn’t know what the comedian was going to say, the laugh is still one of recognition. This may seem like one of those theories that isn’t really of any use, but I’m mentioning it because it’s good to know which you prefer to lean towards. Despite all laughter fitting into one of those two main groups, there are of course infinite ways to create laughter using them. Let’s look at what I consider to be the main styles of comedy:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Anecdotal</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Clowning</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Edgy</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Fantastical</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Heartfelt</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Observational</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Opinionated</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Playful</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Puns</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Philosophical</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Sarcasm</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Satire</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Self-deprecation</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Shock</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Superiority</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Surrealism</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Tragedy</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Wordplay</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Before you look at that list to make sure you know what your main styles are and that you’re not using too many of them, I want to clarify three things:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">An anecdotal comedian almost only tells stories. If you tend to focus on jokes or routines, telling the occasional story doesn’t make your style anecdotal</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The difference between a pun and wordplay<i class="calibre3"> </i>is that a pun is a word that means two things, whereas wordplay is using a collection of words that sound like other words</li>
        <li class="calibre6">An example of superiority is the joke about Johnny Smells, because the audience is laughing at someone else’s expense, which momentarily makes them feel superior to that person. This also creates a bond between the comedian and their audience</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Since that list could be endless, I’ve kept it to eighteen. Don’t worry if how you’d describe one or more of your styles isn’t on that list. All that matters is that you know what your main styles are (and possibly a third one), and that you don’t have too many of them.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I want you to make a note of your styles and add any that you feel I’ve missed out. I should add that they might change as your comedy evolves. Did any of those styles instantly remind you of what you do? If they did, I suggest veering towards the main two, so they become your recognisable styles &ndash; your ‘handwriting’. You <span class="underline">can</span> only go for one type of laugh, but be aware that you’ll be at risk of starting to become predictable. To reiterate, if you’re using lots of styles, I’d say you almost certainly have a problem, and simply culling one or more styles will solve it. All you have to do is decide which are your main ones, which shouldn’t be hard to spot.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Knowing your style of comedy is so important. Tim Vine never risks offending, and Mitch Hedberg would never make his audience feel embarrassed for him. They avoid these things because they clash heavily with their handwriting.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The moment I spend more than a few seconds being observational, and therefore too relatable, I start to feel like I’m becoming an everyman and that’s precious time I could spend filling my audience’s heads with quirky ideas that not only keep my style consistent, but also work in harmony with my persona. Make the most of your time onstage because it’s wasted whenever you give your audience the wrong impression of who you are. Don’t be a jack of all trades. At best, you’ll fade into the background.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Just like displaying a lack of originality can make a comedian forgettable, having multiple styles can also cause audiences to forget them. If you don’t know who you are, how is anyone else going to? I’ve lost count of the amount of times I’ve politely told a comedian friend that I feel a new joke of theirs is out of character, and they’ve replied, <i class="calibre3">‘I know, but it works’.</i> I always think, <i class="calibre3">‘Is that the only question you ask yourself? “Did people laugh?”’</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Imagine if they’d had that approach when it came to furnishing their home. They bought wallpaper, rugs, lamps, paintings, carpets and a sofa, solely because whichever friend they happened to be with when they saw each of those items said that they liked them. Imagine what a sight their living-room would be. They’ll hear guests say things like, <i class="calibre3">‘Nice sofa’ </i>or<i class="calibre3"> ‘Nice lamp’</i>, but they probably won’t ever hear someone say, <i class="calibre3">‘Nice home’.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Without there being harmony between your persona and your style of material, you’re just a person saying words in the hope that some of them will make people laugh. The good news is that, once you find that harmony, you’re pretty much set for life. This is your foundation, and it’s imperative that you build it &ndash; if you haven’t done that already. Your style and persona can evolve with age or just you having an urge to change things, but that foundation will always be there for you to fall back on.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Once you get used to successfully communicating who you are, you’ll not only pick up a specific vibe to match the energy you’re giving off, you’ll also recognise a very strong pattern in people’s facial expressions. For me, there’s a moment one to two minutes into my show when it occurs to my audience<i class="calibre3"> </i>that this intense, overconfident person standing in front of them is actually vulnerable and childlike. That’s the moment their guard goes down, and that’s why it’s imperative for me not to be too harsh on anyone before it happens (creating a ‘no turning back’ moment).</p>
      <p class="subsq1">In fact, a nice way of making sure that the right ‘you’ has come across is to learn to recognise the facial expressions you expect to see in your audience and then look out for them, because seeing them is a sign that your audience have clicked with who you are. This can obviously only come with experience, but I can tell when I haven’t got my persona across by the average facial expression in the front row. If more than thirty percent of the people in my front row look guarded, I know my intensity has overridden my childlike energy and it’s time to reel the intensity in. If my audience doesn’t perceive me how I want them to, suddenly my playful material doesn’t seem so playful because I’m not selling it the right way.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Let’s say, as an extreme example, you’re telling spiteful jokes with unjustified victims; it might explain why your audiences aren’t responding to the ‘love me’ vibes you’re giving off. I said <i class="calibre3">‘might’</i> because there will always be exceptions, and the one exception I can think of is Jim Jefferies because, despite having controversial opinions, he still gives off a childlike and damaged vulnerability. This is a rare harmony, but it can exist.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">If you haven’t already done it, find what harmony works for you &ndash; although you don’t have to understand exactly why that harmony works, you do have to find it. So, enjoy experimenting, just make sure you don’t settle for a lack of harmony, because it’s a major part of what makes a good comedian. Material that’s in conflict with a comedian’s energy can sometimes serve to mask any vibes that they’re trying to give off. If you sense that’s happening to you yet, I strongly suggest that you experiment with finding the harmony between your persona and style of material. This isn’t a topic I’ve ever heard discussed, and that’s probably because comedians find that harmony organically, and therefore without consciously thinking about it. I’d say it evolves as a result of a bit of give and take over time, until the two eventually go hand in hand. However, this process is worth pointing out in case you feel there isn’t a harmony between your material and persona. That way, you can consider what tweaks you can make to help create it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I certainly don’t believe that this is a science. There’s logic involved, but it’s far more about feelings. Most of us found that harmony the way a pebble on a beach finds its shape. If you haven’t found yours yet, that’s only a bad thing if you can’t be bothered to look for it. So, see it as a positive and start exploring. In a way I envy you, because who knows what you’ll find? Since most stand-up only involves words, unless you’re going to spend a fortune on outfits or props, money can’t get in the way of solving any problems, only a lack of commitment.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look at having a third style. This can hugely help to add light and shade to your comedy. When used well it’s extremely effective, and I can’t imagine not having that extra gear. The danger for me personally is that there’s often a clunk in the room if I suddenly go from ending a playful story or routine to starting a heartfelt one, especially if there’s tragedy involved. I’m at great risk of my audience thinking <i class="calibre3">‘Aw! We preferred you when you were playful’.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">It used to happen to me quite often. The result of a sudden mood change between topics isn’t remotely similar to telling a playful story that ends with an edgy twist, because a mood change happening on a punchline is a huge part of why it lands well. It’s all over in a second, and that sudden shift adds to the surprise, just like Chappelle going from philosophical to crude. Having a complete subject change from playful to anything involving tragedy needs care and attention.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Eventually, I decided that rather than audiences having to sit it out until they recovered from a sudden shift in mood as well as shift in their perception of my world, I had to do something about it. If you haven’t experienced it, that shift can feel like a car that’s driving at 50 mph going from fifth gear straight down to first. The puzzle to solve is, how can you change the mood from happy to sad without there being a noticeable clunk?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Earlier, I mentioned reality bridges. This problem can be solved with a different type of bridge: an emotional bridge. They prevent me from causing some very clunky moments onstage. If I want to change topics from one of my main styles to a third conflicting one and this specific gear change feels unnatural, I build a tiny bridge between them using as little as a few words to allow the mood in the room to adjust unnoticed. This change can take as little as ten seconds.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Do you remember my joke about feeling suicidal? This is a perfect example of me needing to create a bridge between styles. It simply wouldn’t work for me to go from bouncing around the stage being playful to suddenly telling my audience that I had felt suicidal. Although this is an example of my own work, I must stress that this method can be applied to anyone’s comedy when that comedian needs to change the mood without there being a clunk in the room.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Let’s say I’ve been relentlessly excitable for five minutes and want to talk about feeling suicidal. So, I’m suddenly changing everything from being fun to tragic. When I first tried the bit onstage, the moment I stopped being playful to tell my audience that I was going through a divorce, people’s faces would noticeably sink. Women, in particular, suddenly looked heartbroken. All of a sudden, this playful, childlike person had adult problems. It must have felt like watching a clown juggling three bowling balls and suddenly dropping one, leaving a permanent dent in the floor. I knew I had to do something, because it just felt unfair on everyone.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">After several clunky performances, this is how I eventually tackled it:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Single ladies, make some noise’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">LADIES CHEER.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘You know I said I was married? Guess what? I’m going through a divorce’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">HIGH-FIVES SINGLE LADY IN FRONT ROW.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘You’re back in the game!’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The laugh on ‘<i class="calibre3">You’re back in the game!’</i> is simple and unsophisticated. However, since I’m quite odd-looking, it’s an ironic celebration of single women in the audience finding out that I’m available, so is actually self-deprecating. More importantly, the high-five is playful. So, what I’ve actually achieved is brought up my sad news in the form of a positive (that I’m single) and that’s the bridge between <i class="calibre3">playful</i> and <i class="calibre3">heartfelt.</i> I then move straight on to talking about not living with my children and then feeling suicidal as a result and the dramatic emotional change goes unnoticed.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I can’t stress enough how effective this is and I really hope that it helps you, as it’s a method I wish I’d discovered years ago. I believe it can be done with any two situations if you search hard enough. I want you to fully take onboard the idea of bridging a change in style or mood, because there’s nothing worse than feeling that clunk in a room. Rather than accepting those moments and causing your audience to sit through them whenever they happen, be that conductor who’s going to take your orchestra exactly where you want, when you want. Whenever you fail to achieve that &ndash; and I’ve failed hundreds of times &ndash; see it as you dropping your baton and the entire orchestra having to stop playing whilst you awkwardly bend down to pick it up and carry on. I say this because that’s exactly what it feels like to an audience, and it shouldn’t be acceptable to allow this to regularly happen, especially since it can be avoided.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">As I mentioned, I didn’t invent mood bridges, I’m just very aware of when one’s needed. Whenever I watch a comedian masterfully adding one, I get as much joy from having spotted the bridge as I do from the two routines either side of it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Let’s imagine your two main styles are comedy songs and magic, and you occasionally do one-liners as your third style, and bridging may not seem relevant to you. However, one day you might face an aggressive heckler who ends up being dragged out by security and, if that happens, you’ll eventually have to go back to your set. Doing that requires a bridge and, assuming you haven’t been in that exact situation before, it’ll mean working out how to build a bridge on the spot.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you already know what your two main styles are, do they work in harmony with each other and your persona? If you have a third style (it’s fine if you <span class="underline">don’t</span> have one), does it complement them? Personally, my main two styles are <i class="calibre3">playful </i>and<i class="calibre3"> edgy,</i> and my third style is <i class="calibre3">heartfelt</i>. Heartfelt creates a nice contrast to my main two styles.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I want to tell you about a time I failed to get my styles across to an audience. I was recently the comedian guest on a mock version of the TV show <i class="calibre3">Countdown</i> for a group of lawyers, who were competing with each other in a small theatre. It was a lot of fun. I had to do four separate five-minute monologues throughout the evening, seated with my hosts.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">As I was preparing for the show, the only thought I had was to make my first set as relevant to the theme of the show as possible. What I’d completely overlooked was how I’d come across in that five minutes. I did a very edgy line early on that made the audience conclude that I was a controversial comedian, and then did my one and only pun a minute later because it was a story about punctuation and therefore relevant to the show. This story usually works well because the pun comes out of nowhere twenty to twenty-five minutes into a show that, up until that moment, has no puns. Suddenly I was perceived as an edgy comedian who did puns. By the time I was being playful, they’d already decided I was cruel and suddenly being playful didn’t seem authentic. So, my audience had no idea who I was because I’d created a Frankenstein’s monster of a persona. I was experiencing not taking my own advice first hand, but the huge difference was that I knew exactly how my audience’s energy towards me was supposed to feel and it certainly wasn’t going to plan this time. Luckily, since it was a game with twenty-minute sections between each of my monologues, I was given three more chances over the course of the evening to readjust my audience’s impression of who I was. Plus, the first twenty-minute section of the game was enough of a distraction to inadvertently cause my audience to reset their brains, allowing me to rebuild their impression of me by showing a consistency to my style. In stand-up you get one chance. Don’t become a Frankenstein’s monster.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Once your material works in harmony with your persona, you’ll start to <span class="underline">only</span> create material that keeps those two things aligned and I believe that is as important as anything you can achieve as a comedian. I know I’ve already brushed upon this, but that’s what being a comedian is pretty much about. When I watch a comedian who hasn’t found that harmony, I feel they’ll be limited until they find it. In fact, people do stand-up for over twenty years without that happening and, as a result, something’s missing that they can’t put their finger on, yet they don’t change what they do. So, understanding this is imperative.</p>

        <li class="calibre6">The type of clothes you wear</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The car you drive</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The way you talk about yourself and other people</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">With the exception of the car you drive, all of these things apply to a comedian when they’re onstage. For now, let’s focus on one, <i class="calibre3">‘The way you talk about yourself and other people’.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">When it comes to status, this is more important than all the other things on that list put together, and here’s why. If you humbly walk onstage looking scruffy in cheap-looking clothes but end up being the winner of most of your stories, you’re high status &ndash; regardless of how your audience first perceived you when you walked onstage. This is extremely important to understand, because status has far more to do with what happens to you in your jokes or stories than how you look or move. This is why it’s so important to understand who the victim of a joke is.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you want to be seen as high status, it’s certainly effective to follow the general patterns that people react to when it comes to someone instantly suggesting that they’re high status, such as wearing smart clothes, having confident body language etc. However, you don’t <span class="underline">have</span> to do any of those things. Just make sure that you’ve thought it through and have worked out exactly why you’re not doing some of the things that scream out ‘high status’.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Just like a scruffy comedian isn’t necessarily low status, wearing a smart suit doesn’t always mean a comedian is high status. Lee Evans always wears a smart suit and yet is extremely low status because his physical comedy is largely built around him failing. His audiences are definitely laughing <span class="underline">at</span> him. He sometimes buttons up his suit on the wrong buttonhole, creating the appearance of someone who’s tried to look smart, but is so clumsy that they’ve failed. Even when his suit is buttoned up correctly, he still gives us the impression that he’s made an effort to dress up (as opposed to someone who’s used to wearing a suit) and that in itself is low status.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Let’s look at three examples of appearance and status:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6"><b class="calibre4">Lee Evans &ndash; </b>Wears a smart suit, but loses &ndash; <b class="calibre4">Low status</b></li>
        <li class="calibre6"><b class="calibre4">Steven Wright &ndash; </b>Often has messy hair and is unshaven, but wins &ndash; <b class="calibre4">High status</b></li>
        <li class="calibre6"><b class="calibre4">Joan Rivers &ndash; </b>Dresses glamorously and generally wins &ndash; <b class="calibre4">High status</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Of these three comedians, Joan Rivers is the only one whose outfit noticeably matches their status the moment they start talking. She struts up and down the stage, dressed glamorously, often shocking her audience by pushing taste boundaries and making incredibly cruel jokes about celebrities. This is all very high status, yet she’ll later do an entire section on being unloved, which is very low status. This is perfect because her third style, <i class="calibre3">tragedy</i>, adds depth to her persona. To me, it not only gives a back-story that explains why she’s being so cruel, it also means that she’s giving us some light and shade by turning the laughs on herself. This is a perfect example of how flashing a comedian’s third style can be extremely effective when it works in harmony with their main two styles, despite appearing to clash with them.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There clearly aren’t rules when it comes to finding the harmony between status and outfit. However, given how quickly we judge someone by their appearance, the good comedians who don’t follow the obvious patterns that society suggests they should are still able to get their status across very quickly, as well as why they dress the way they do. This is because they know exactly what they’re doing as a result of experimenting and thinking it through.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Finding that harmony is a bit like colour coordinating two items of clothing or furniture; they just feel right next to each other, and that comes from trying different combinations to see which ones go well together. There are so many different things that can happen within a minute of you being onstage, and a world-class comedian uses several of them to make it known that they’re brilliant very quickly and it’s a truly beautiful thing to behold, especially when you have no expectations of that comedian.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you haven’t been onstage yet, no one is expecting you to look experienced or to have found the harmony between your persona and stage outfit. So, don’t worry too much about that for now, and focus on embracing the wonderful and fun journey that you’re about to go on. However, regardless of your experience, I want you to be fully aware that every single moment onstage can potentially work in your favour, and one of my goals is for you to work towards maximising those moments. There are so many different aspects of this art form to think about, and your job over the next few months is to apply every one of my methods and theories that you feel is something you should be doing more of, and eventually become the best comedian you can be. That thought genuinely excites me.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Someone who doesn’t understand why a comedian’s status is far more about their material and attitude than their clothes might look at Steven Wright and assume that, since he looks slightly scruffy, he’s low status. He may be weird and seems confused by the world around him, but he is very happy to constantly share brilliant thoughts that we, the audience, couldn’t have. You might occasionally see Steven Wright in a smart outfit, but he’ll be unshaven with messy hair. I once saw him clean-shaven in a suit, but he also wore a hat, keeping his look unconventional. I’ve seen very early footage of him where he was clean-shaven with groomed hair and wore an ironed shirt. Why? Simply because he hadn’t yet found the harmony between his persona and image. Even the most talented comedians need to experiment before they get it right, but they all get it right in the end.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you haven’t found your look yet, embrace that fact and experiment with different looks. It’s never too late to tweak details about your persona, style or look. Creating brilliant, new material is a never-ending job and a beautiful way to live your life. However, finding a look that works in harmony with everything else you’re doing might only take a few weeks. Not only that, if your persona doesn’t need to change, neither does your look.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">As I’ve mentioned, this is part of the most exciting stage of your journey. Just like a teenager experimenting with how they want their friends and society to perceive them, do the same with your outfits and your audience. So, enjoy the ride and that ride can only happen if you climb onboard whatever thing suits this particular metaphor. If you’re the type of comedian who feels that they’re completely themselves onstage and therefore you wear the clothes you wear in your everyday life rather than having a consistent look, you should still avoid certain outfits from your wardrobe because some of them might do damage to your audience’s impression of you. Basically, if you think stage outfits are contrived and your agenda is to look like you haven’t thought it through and have a different look every time you go onstage, meet me halfway and still think it through. No one’s going to know, so it’ll still look natural.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">As a new comedian I used to watch Hattie Hayridge in awe, having already seen her stand-up on TV and as Holly in <i class="calibre3">Red Dwarf</i>. She’d stand motionless in a stripy party dress, delivering killer lines in a deadpan style, and she never smiled. The dress juxtaposed her style beautifully. Who goes to a party and doesn’t so much as smile? So, her outfit complements her persona by clashing with it, and therefore highlights the fact that her comedy is deadpan. So that’s one approach.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you don’t use your appearance to your advantage with regard to your persona and material you must think about how to change that, because it’s a significant part of being a good comedian. My look is simple; I always wear a colourful T-shirt and plain trousers, and I never wear black. The reason I always wear a colourful T-shirt is because it makes me look like a children’s TV presenter. This disarming look works in harmony with the fact that I’m playful and yet, in the same way that Hattie Hayridge’s dresses contrast her persona, colourful clothes create a contrast to my edgy material.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Not only would I never wear black, I wouldn’t wear a suit, because it makes me look too high status. Any passionate opinions I have suddenly seem like they’re coming from a politician rather than a thoughtful clown. If I wore a black suit, my comedy would still work in the same way that popping a balloon several syllables before the final word of a punchline doesn’t mean that punchline will fail. It just wouldn’t be as effective. This is just one of the many small things that contribute to making a huge difference if you’re doing several of them. So, as simple as my look may be, I’ve thought it through even though it took a while to come to that conclusion.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I once asked the brilliantly brutal comedian Mandy Knight why she wore a cheongsam-style suit onstage and she explained that, since her comedy involves being brutal to the people in the front row of her audience, she wants to make it clear from the start that she doesn’t take herself seriously. By doing that, her audiences are far more likely to accept her being brutal. Her style evolved over time, and her outfit came soon after.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Some comedians have a look that’s as good as a uniform (Harry Hill, early Russell Brand), some comedians vary their outfits, but are extremely consistent in their choice of outfits (Katherine Ryan, Sarah Millican) and some comedians wear whatever they felt like putting on that day to suit the weather or their mood. I can’t think of an example of one of those comedians because, as brilliant as some of them are, there are so many of them that no one sprung to mind, and that’s exactly why I feel that having a look can really help people to remember you. I’ve been guilty of getting ready for a gig when I’ve been slightly behind on my laundry and realised that there isn’t a combination of T-shirt and trousers that both fit my onstage look. If this happens to you, do what I did and buy more clothes. What I’ve occasionally resorted to wearing didn’t ever clash with my persona &ndash; it just didn’t enhance it, and that’s not ideal.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Going back to status in a comedian’s material, although Mitch Hedberg would appear to be slightly lost or stoned, he was almost never the victim of his jokes. In fact, I can only think of one example of him putting himself down, but it was a throwaway line and it’s no surprise that, when I saw him perform it live, a part of me instinctively felt that it was out of character for him to say. Although the way he carried himself made him appear to be low status, his jokes ended with him either winning or showing his audience that he’s very clever, proving that he was actually far from lost, and that’s high status. He was ultimately sharing a brilliant mind that looked at everything around him in a unique way, resulting in his audience celebrating that mind, and I feel extremely privileged to have both met him briefly and seen him perform live twice.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">High status comedians win by either showing you they’ve worked out why other people are wrong, not as bright as they are, or simply by presenting several brilliant ideas that clearly give across the message that they’re proud of themselves for having had those ideas. Personally, I go in, seemingly low status, and build rapidly up to high status.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">By being playful and childlike (my natural characteristics as a person), it prevents me from seeming too high status, even though I am. So, I appear to be low status early on to prove that I don’t take myself too seriously. That way, I can share original thoughts and ideas without being in danger of my audience thinking <i class="calibre3">‘Who does he think he is?’</i> Once I’m fully established as high status I’ll occasionally come out looking bad, but I generally win and the audience celebrates those wins because they’ve warmed to me.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s a very British thing for an audience to need to warm to a comedian before they want to see them win. American audiences are more than happy to watch someone win from the start. We’ll look at this huge cultural difference a lot more in a few minutes.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s absolutely nothing wrong with starting high status and staying there the entire time you’re onstage &ndash; just make sure that you’re aware of that, and have such a strong persona that your audiences get onboard with the idea that you’re that high status. If your funniness is a result of you being bulletproof then that needs to be very clear, and that requires a combination of conviction and fully understanding your status.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I want you to mentally go over all your favourite material and ask who, if anyone, loses in each situation you describe. If you haven’t done your first gig yet, now is a good time to think about it, even though you’re probably already dizzy from jumping ahead a bit. This is easier to do with a story because, very often, the comedian will either embarrass themselves, outwit someone, or give a baddie their comeuppance. This is harder to do with short jokes, especially since often the comedian doesn’t win or lose.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">What if you’re the kind of comedian who tells stories about things that you witness, as opposed to things that happen to you, and therefore you neither win or lose? No matter how much effort you make to not give off high or low status vibes, there will still be flashes here and there within your punchlines that show your status, and therefore that should also have some consistency.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Sometimes a comedian will talk about the time they said something very witty. Even if no one comes out looking bad, if they’re being seen as witty, that’s still high status. The truth is that stand-up comedy is a person standing onstage sharing a collection of thoughts that they’re proud of, but there are ways of hiding that to prevent you from appearing boastful. If it suits your persona not to boast, it’s important to acknowledge that whenever you write any material that involves you winning. Idiot savants hide it as much as the entire time.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When a traditional stand-up comedian shares a clever thing they once said, there are ways of softening that boast. For example, telling us about a moment in your life when you were witty that starts with:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘and then I said…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">…puts you at very high risk of seeming boastful. If it suits your persona to do that, that’s fine, but you really must consider how you’ll come across in those moments, especially if there are several of them within one show. Your status can be slightly lowered by doing one simple thing. Instead of telling your audience what you said, simply change it to:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘and I <span class="underline">thought</span>…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This may seem the same as saying ‘<i class="calibre3">and then I said…’</i> but it’s very different, because you’re not so much winning as sharing with your new friends (the audience) a funny thought you once had. After all, keeping a thought to yourself is humble. Sharing that thought with a roomful of strangers at a social gathering would certainly risk sounding boastful, but the reason it can still be done with humility in a comedy show is because your audience has paid to hear you being funny, which certainly makes it acceptable.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">You might be thinking <i class="calibre3">‘What if the other person responds to what I said to them in the story?’</i> In that case, you obviously need to say, <i class="calibre3">‘and then I said…’</i> Just make sure the other person <span class="underline">deserves</span> to hear your response.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">A good method for seeming less boastful when it comes to outsmarting people is to make the person you’re about to outsmart as dislikeable as possible, causing your audience to feel that the person deserved to be outsmarted. That way, you’re not so much boasting as giving a bully their comeuppance. If done well, your audience will be dying for that to happen, adding far more emotion to the story. This can be achieved by simply reverse engineering a comment or action by that person earlier in the story, which instantly makes the audience dislike them even more. I say <i class="calibre3">‘even more’</i> because, if you’re outsmarting them, I assume they’ve at least done something wrong. Outsmarting someone who hasn’t done anything wrong is a dangerous thing to do &ndash; almost like punching a passerby in the street.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s very easy to make the other person in a story more dislikeable by exaggerating what’s already wrong about what they’ve said or done. Ultimately, making them more dislikeable should fit within the story and this doesn’t have to involve you lying if you don’t want it to, just changing a word or two or exaggerating their tone of voice. However, if that’s difficult to do (which is very unlikely), it can be achieved within a brief tangent from the story about that person. A story can backfire on a comedian if the person they outsmart hasn’t done anything wrong. You don’t want to ever find your audience siding with the other person in an argument that ends with you asking for their support when you win it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Unless you want to be seen to shamelessly boast, which is fine if that suits your persona, try to occasionally hide your boasts or you’ll risk appearing smug, and that can take away from your likeability. Some comedians are likeable because they’re unapologetically charmless and, as a result, their charm comes from not caring what their audiences think about them. Other comedians just come across as boastful without having any redeeming qualities, and that’s the type of comedian I really don’t want you to become. This difference is because of two vital things:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Having a very definable persona</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Understanding your charisma and using it to your advantage</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Charisma goes a long way, and we all have to experiment with what our individual charisma can achieve. This is a fascinating journey, and I urge you to experiment with what makes you likeable to audiences.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Some comedians ooze warmth, and therefore gravitate towards that when they realise audiences love them for that warmth. Other comedians have so little warmth that they eventually gravitate towards a style that their natural energy suits, and their material gradually shifts to fit that style. I’ve seen comedians try to be edgy and it not seem believable coming from them. Some comedians who know how little charisma they’ve got have found a way of being funny by celebrating their lack of charisma. Some comedians are brilliant thinkers, but not very charismatic, and those comedians sometimes decide to create an alter ego or become a character comedian. Often, their creation is very charismatic, despite them not being very charismatic themselves. That’s not to say I don’t believe that any character comedians are also charismatic offstage; there are quite a few of them. I’ve certainly noticed that people without little quirks often create characters with big quirks. I’ve also seen some comedians try to be charming and fail, but don’t change their approach because they don’t realise that they lack charm. These are the comedians who get stuck in a rut because they haven’t found what works for them. Here’s the interesting part; no matter how much of an artist you are and no matter how much you refuse to compromise artistically, your audiences will still influence gradual changes in your persona by causing you to lean towards what makes you funny. So, audiences are like a giant magnet that pulls you towards your uniqueness, and I believe this happens without you realising. This is not the same as pandering, it’s about finding your inner clown.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Empathy comes in many forms, but it has to exist for an audience to buy into what you do. They can empathise that you have very little empathy for the world around you (for example, Frankie Boyle). However, watching a charmless comedian boasting can come across as vulgar. When this happens, it’s down to that comedian not being aware of their specific charisma (if they have any) or not having a persona that suits them being very high status. This can be avoided by thinking your status through, and asking if it suits your persona.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">As organic as that journey may seem, this chapter is here to help you check that you’re on track. You know the cliché that magicians aren’t likeable? This generally happens as a result of their main agenda being to prove that they’re clever, rather than to entertain.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">It can be very similar when a comedian starts to seem like they’re only onstage to be the hero of their stories, get their fix and go home.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look at two very different situations and exactly why they both work:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">A &ndash; </b> (in response to someone being very rude)</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘and then I said…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">B &ndash; </b> (in response to someone <span class="underline">not</span> being rude)</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘and I thought…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">‘A’ works because the comment is justified and ‘B’ works because, since it’s only a thought, it isn’t a boast. Now let’s look at one more:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">C &ndash; </b> (in response to someone <span class="underline">not</span> being rude)</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘and then I said…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’m not a fan of ‘C’ because the comedian is not only boasting &ndash; the boast isn’t justified. This is a classic case of <i class="calibre3">‘and then I said’</i>  looking like the comedian is patting themselves on the back. However, if you’re going to regularly do exactly that, you’d better have a very definable, high status persona and be as charismatic as you are high status. It can certainly work, it’s just not for everyone.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look at a low status comedian winning. If you’re low status, I strongly suggest that, if you are going to win in a story, either do it towards the end or at the very end of your show. This not only prevents your audience from getting confused as to who you are, when you finally flip things around and become the winner, it can create an extremely powerful moment for your audience.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Tommy Cooper was a giant of a man with a face that made him look clueless, and he maximised that with his comical stage outfit, facial expressions and material. He also did magic tricks that would go horribly wrong. However, every now and again, he’d get one right. This is why Tommy Cooper and Emo Philips have one subtle thing in common, that’s important to fully understand if you’re either very low status or playing an idiot savant, and that’s that they both occasionally win. A comedian finally winning, having lost several times, creates a very pleasant moment for an audience because of the build-up of empathy throughout that comedian’s show.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Emo goes through life making huge mistakes and getting into trouble, but will occasionally outsmart someone. This is not only powerful, it’s potentially dangerous to only watch someone fail, as their audiences might start to feel too sorry for them, especially in Emo’s case because there’s tragedy in his stories. A loser occasionally winning is also effective because it keeps their audiences guessing. This is not to be confused with constantly flipping back and forth from high to low status because that can have little to no impact and, as I’ve mentioned, can also confuse your audience as to who you are. Although Emo occasionally flips things by winning and outsmarting someone, his weird perspective on the world around him means that he often says insightful things without appearing to realise that he’s just been clever. This is <span class="underline">not</span> the same as outsmarting someone, because it’s his weirdness that led him to having those thoughts. So, an idiot savant tends to say brilliant things without knowing why they’re brilliant.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">An idiot savant finally winning might look something like this:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Loses</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Loses</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Says something brilliant without realising why</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Loses</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Says something brilliant without realising why</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Loses</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Finally wins by outsmarting someone</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s this simple; if an audience has empathy for someone when they lose, losing several times and finally winning creates a very emotional moment for that audience. It’s important to understand that, no matter how ingenious the thinking is when a comedian loses, they’re still low status. No matter how ingenious the thinking is behind them saying something brilliant without knowing why, they’re not boasting. So, when Emo finally fights back and wins, his audience is delighted for him.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">As simple as this pattern is, it can only be achieved by understanding who the victim of a joke is, and being aware of what your audience is feeling. Watching a comedian losing several times and then winning is an extreme version of ‘A’ (saying <i class="calibre3">‘and then I said…’</i>  in response to someone being very rude).</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Look at the impact winning can have when structure is involved, and how profoundly different the outcome is compared to when a comedian who lacks a strong persona and doesn’t have the type of charisma that suits boasting ends yet another story by telling their audience that they once outsmarted someone. These two punchlines aren’t even in the same world as each other, and that’s because one comedian understands the emotional build-up to them winning and the other one just thinks that sharing all the funny things they’ve ever said offstage makes for good comedy. It’s certainly an achievement if their audiences laugh &ndash; but imagine the difference from an audience’s perspective.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you put yourself in the mind of your audience, imagine how this might feel watching a low status comedian:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">A:</b></p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Loses</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Loses</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Loses</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Loses</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Wins</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">When you look at things this way, why would a low status comedian choose to do this?</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">B:</b></p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Loses</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Wins</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Loses</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Loses</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Loses</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Again, there are no rules. So, just like popping balloons mid-sentence, if you’re going to apply ‘B’, you’d better know exactly why you’re doing it. However, if you’re low status and are applying ‘B’ to a set containing lots of stories, there’s a very good chance that you’re not getting anywhere near the reactions you could be getting when you win.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">In some cases, understanding exactly where a certain bit of material goes in your show can be just as important as coming up with the bit itself and making that decision. Provided your gig is going to plan, you can have an A-to-Z set that meticulously controls your audience’s empathy for you throughout, and then strike at the right moment with an extreme status shift. When it comes to finally winning in that story, don’t forget to make the other person dislikeable (if they aren’t already).</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I want you to carefully consider every situation that can change your audience’s perception of you. Unintentional leaks of sending out the wrong message might be very subtle, and you’ll get away with the occasional one but they will add up. Even though I pluck material out of the air depending on the energy in the room, when it comes to sudden shifts in my status, I am conscious not to win very early on, because it doesn’t suit my persona to start high status.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Some comedians are so high status that they’ll never be seen losing, and some comedians are so low status that they’ll never be seen winning, but the occasional momentary shift in status can be very effective when done skilfully, but must not be confused with flipping back and forth, leaving your audience confused as to who you are.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Look at this list and ask yourself if you do any of these things:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Start high status and stay high</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Start low status and stay low</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Start low status and build to high</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Start high status and drop to low</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Constantly flip between high and low status</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Although I don’t think I’ve ever seen a comedian start high status and drop to low, that doesn’t mean you can’t make it work for you, just make sure you understand why you’re doing it. If you don’t identify with any of the things on that list, mentally go over quite a lot of your own material and ask yourself if you come out looking good or bad most of the time. Remember, proudly pointing out things that people haven’t noticed counts as winning, even if no one loses. Once you’ve done that, lean towards what you do most if you feel it suits your persona. If you only relate to the last one on that list, then we definitely have a problem that needs solving, and that can be done by doing a combination of these things:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Making your status lower by softening boasts / losing</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Making your status higher by adding boasts / winning</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Rearranging your status</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Dropping material that doesn’t suit your persona</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Let’s look at rearranging your status. This is an extremely handy skill and is definitely worth applying before dropping any material that doesn’t suit your voice.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Do you remember Tim Vine’s nuisance phone call joke? What would’ve happened if Mitch Hedberg had had the exact same idea? I’m going to rewrite Tim’s joke in Mitch’s style purely to demonstrate rearranging a joke from low to high status:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I used to work for this telephone company and there was this one dude who’d ring up and complain about different stuff…every damn day. One time, he said, “I’d like to report a nuisance phone call”. I said…“Not you again”’. (2 / 4)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although it’s the same idea with the same last four words in the punchline, it has a completely different outcome because we’re now laughing <span class="underline">with</span> Mitch by celebrating the fact that he outsmarted the other person. It’s a short seesaw because Mitch has a unique and consistent flow and I’ve emulated that.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Once you fully understand status, you’ll not only be aware of where you stand in a joke, you’ll often be able to juggle a new idea around until it suits your voice.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Do you remember this joke?</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘You know when you go through airport security; they make everyone take their belts off, and there’s an area where you put them back on? I always stand next to a beautiful woman. That way…it looks like we’ve just done it’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is actually an unusual joke because, although I have a mini-victory (high status), it reveals a flaw in<i class="calibre3"> </i>me, the lengths I’m prepared to go to if I want to get an idea of how it would feel to be in that situation in real life (low status). So, it’s low status as well as high status. This kind of joke suits my voice because it’s inventive without being smug. By showing vulnerability, it softens the element of winning.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Once you fully understand status and can apply it to your material, you can fine-tune things to find the perfect harmony between your style and persona. Do not overlook this detail. What’s so exciting about this is that (assuming you’re not doing it already), once you’ve fully absorbed all the information from the previous chapter, this chapter and the following chapter, your comedy can move up to the next level.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is why I deliberately put these three topics back-to-back:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Finding Your Style of Comedy</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Status</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Persona</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">A consistency in status plays just as important a role as a consistency in style of material. If Bill Hicks is showing us that he’s worked out how we should all be living our lives, he can’t end half of his stories with him failing to keep his dignity. This generally applies to all ‘preachy’ comedy. An exception would be Jim Jefferies (again) who, despite showing his audience that he’s thought through a lot of social situations and exposes flaws in people’s mentality towards things such as US gun laws, he does it from an everyman’s perspective. This not only makes it endearing as he’s not coming across as boastful, he can also tell a story about being lactose intolerant, eating cheese in a smart restaurant, getting delayed on the way home and not making it to the bathroom in time. He can do this because he’s presented himself as no more intelligent &ndash; arguably even less intelligent &ndash; than his audience. This is a very rare mix of high and low status, and is proof that there are no strict rules. Watching a low status comedian sharing some of the answers to life (which is not the same as watching an idiot savant) can be very endearing because they’re not putting themselves above their audience. This subtle detail causes audiences to will that comedian to succeed.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Personally, I like to occasionally top up what I call my ‘humility credit’ by telling a story where I lose. I do this because I don’t want to come across as a show-off by relentlessly presenting well-thought-out ideas. However, I’m no less playful when I lose than when I win, which still shows a consistency in style. So, I’m not saying that every single line of yours must have the same message, but look at the bigger picture and be aware of why any bit of your material benefits or doesn’t benefit you in the long-run, because there’s no point aimlessly flipping between styles and statuses. Only when you find the harmony between your style, status and persona can you be a truly brilliant comedian.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Do you win or lose most of the time; does it suit your persona to win or lose most of the time? As I mentioned, Tommy Cooper and Emo Philips very occasionally flip their status and win, and they know exactly when to do it (and that’s not two jokes into a show). Comedians who don’t understand status often unintentionally leak signs of not quite having the status they claim to have.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s an example of a subtle, yet relevant unintentional leak. I once saw an extremely high status comedian at The Comedy Store in London, as good a venue globally as I’ve ever performed at. As a new comedian, my mission was to one day regularly perform there. The standard of comedians booked to play at this venue is extremely high. However, this was a newer comedian doing a ten-minute open spot (an unpaid gig when you’re starting out). He was in a slick suit and instantly gave off alpha-male vibes. This was his opening line:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Hello, Comedy Store. How the f#@k are you?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Believe it or not, he’d already made two mistakes. For now, let’s just look at the first one, the subtle one. This amazing, purpose-built venue is in London’s West End and attracts audiences from all over Britain as well as tourists from several other countries (something he’d have been aware of) and yet this very high status comedian greeted 400 people, almost none of whom, if any, were from Central London with <i class="calibre3">‘Hello, Comedy Store’.</i> These people had all just paid to be at one of the most famous comedy venues in Europe, many of them for the first time, and were all very excited to be there. If you’re high status, then you walk onstage to own that room, and the audience members are your guests. So, they’re not ‘The Comedy Store’ &ndash; you are.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you had a party in your actual home, you wouldn’t welcome your guests with <i class="calibre3">‘Hello, Queen’s Road’</i> and if you did, it would certainly feel very strange for everyone else present. However, if you’re a comedian who’s clearly from another town, city or country to the majority of your audience, then that’s different. Then you’re the outsider and can celebrate being a guest in the audience’s home (their city), and can then own the stage, like a pleasant invasion.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s a huge difference between a comedian performing at an art centre in a small town and a venue that’s in the heart of a major city. Since that venue isn’t anyone’s home, claim it as yours. However, if you’re very low status, then that changes things. Play it in a way that suits your status and persona. By all means call the audience by the venue name to show that you’re not at home, and then go on to own the room in a way that suits your persona, having just set up that your status is low. Either way, think it through, because this is the perfect chance to make a subtle first impression. So many of the little things we do can be beneficial to how we’re perceived by an audience, and we should make all those things work in our favour.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Once I was talking to the incredibly original comedian, Paul Foot, about not wanting my audience to ever see me with a coat on inside a venue before going onstage. He nodded and replied, <i class="calibre3">‘The show starts the second you arrive at the venue’.</i> This was a very interesting approach. You could even say that the show starts as soon as you arrive in the vicinity of the venue.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Imagine being in a TV studio watching Graham Norton oozing charm and warmth whilst interviewing a celebrity, having just seen him screaming abuse at a traffic warden (something he wouldn’t do because he’s an adorable human being). However, imagine that happened in front of some of his audience as they were queueing outside the TV studio.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">A more realistic example of my point is to not stand in full view of your audience before you go onstage, pacing up and down or staring at a sheet of paper covered in notes. This is something that I witness on a semi-regular basis. If your agenda is to be seen being relaxed and effortlessly funny, surely you don’t want anyone in your audience to perceive you as someone who’s just been nervously reciting. The good thing about having your notes on your phone is that anyone who sees you looking at them before you go onstage can’t possibly know what you’re looking at. Just remember not to be seen pacing.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s something very common that newer comedians often do. They’ll begin a routine with <i class="calibre3">‘I still have a day job’</i> and then do some material about what it’s like doing what they do for a living. To me this is very similar to a boom mic moment as, until that moment the audience assumed they were watching a full-time comedian. You don’t want your audience wondering why if 200 people have just paid £25, why are they watching a part-time comedian? At very least, that’s distracting. Yes, it’s honest to admit your situation and, if your comedy is based on your real-life experiences, honesty is important. However, what if you’re very high status? That creates a major shift in how the audience will view you, having just paid good money to hear your thoughts on life from a superior perspective.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">How can you get around this problem without dropping your material about having a day job? If it’s important to you to keep your comedy based in truth, it’s sometimes possible to compromise with a white lie. In this case, starting a routine with <i class="calibre3">‘I used to be a teacher’.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’d say the exception would be if you want to talk about how strenuous your current situation is. Then, it would be forgivable to admit that you’ve still got a day job because the emotions you’re sharing are about your current daily struggle. However, if you’re very high status, it had better be a strong routine that justifies this status drop, and hopefully one that doesn’t result in you being humiliated by one of your pupils. That’s not a humility credit moment as it’s a double drop in status, and will make it hard for you to go back to being very high status. Even if your day job story is high status, you’re still at risk of permanently lowering your status. So, be aware of what happens the moment you mention not being a full-time comedian. Regardless of whether you’re high or low status, I strongly suggest that you never start your show by mentioning that you have a day job. Always establish yourself as a good comedian before mentioning being a part-time one, so that you fully gain your audience’s trust.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you were eating in a restaurant and it was the chef’s first day, wouldn’t you rather hear that when you were on your dessert than when you walked in the door? No restaurant has a sign outside saying <i class="calibre3">‘Chef’s First Day’</i> (unless the previous chef was notoriously awful, and that situation doesn’t apply to this analogy).</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although I’m obviously not mad on comedians telling their audience that they’ve got a day job, if you’re low status it can actually add to you being an underdog, even though everything else you do should be able to get that message across on its own. The danger with being low status and telling your audiences that you’ve still got a day job is that you might start to get used to the extra empathy and use it as a crutch and, before you know it, you’re a full-time comedian who’s pretending they’ve still got a day job. If you’re high status playing a high-profile venue, you really should consider what’s happening to your audience’s perception of you if you refer to yourself as not being a ‘proper comedian’, having spent the last five minutes pacing up and down the stage, telling your audience how to live their lives. However, if twenty people have paid £5 to watch you at an open mic night in the backroom of a tiny pub, that’s very different because the setting suggests that you’re a newish comedian, plus the other comedians will no doubt also have day jobs. In fact, pretending that you’re a full-time comedian in that environment would be a stupid thing to do, and actually work against you because your audience would expect more from you than the other comedians on the same bill. If you’re a new comedian and aren’t comfortable telling a white lie about not having a day job any more, which I completely respect, meet me halfway and fully establish yourself before telling your audience that you’re not full-time.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Sometimes low status jokes fail miserably because they’re not believable coming from that comedian. I once saw a very handsome, 25-year-old man in a smart suit, talking about how he hadn’t had sex for years and you could almost hear people thinking<i class="calibre3"> ‘How is that even possible?’</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I was doing a writing job with someone who’s globally well-known and, while bouncing an idea back and forth, I made a joke about shoplifting and they loved it and said they wanted to use the line. I had to politely point out that, unless their persona was unhinged (which it wasn’t), audiences simply weren’t going to believe that someone worth millions of pounds would ever go shoplifting.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">A good example of a comedian keeping their status believable is Lee Evans. He somehow manages to talk about the agony of flying economy and a packed stadium of people don’t even question that that’s not how he lives now, because they’re mesmerised by his phenomenal performance. I realise that he still would have experienced an economy fight at some point in his life, but either way, his audience isn’t thinking about how wealthy he is because they’re swept up by his comedy, which is a credit to his persona. I didn’t see the entire show, but I’d bet he didn’t do a routine about having a second home (assuming he has one) because he knows that would completely ruin everyone’s low status impression of him.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Often, I’ll watch a new comedian walk onstage in old jeans, a faded T-shirt and dirty trainers because that’s what they usually wear offstage, and deliver some lovely lines that, for various reasons, should be coming from someone with a very different look. They might have seen Steven Wright doing the same thing and decided that makes it okay, because he’s an incredible comedian. It simply doesn’t. Steven Wright has messy hair and stubble and sounds like he’s stoned or in a slight daze.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Chris Rock has always worn very expensive, slick-looking suits because he’s on top of life, telling us how it is. However, in his Netflix special <i class="calibre3">Tamborine</i> he talked about his marriage failing and his life not being so good. What did he wear? A black T-shirt, jeans and trainers. His hair was even slightly messy. He also sits on the stage for some of the show, showing vulnerability. He clearly decided to not wear a suit as a way of lowering his status. Imagine Chris Rock sitting on a stage in a shiny suit, talking about failing in life. It simply wouldn’t look right.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">I’m not saying that your outfit must match the impression your material is getting across, but I am saying that you should think it through. If Tommy Cooper looked completely slick, as opposed to looking silly in a fez that’s juxtaposed with a dinner suit, it would fail to highlight the fact that his persona and presence both suggest that he’s a clumsy fool and therefore wouldn’t be as believable. These two comedians are applying different methods to highlight their personas, but what they clearly have in common is that they’ve thought it through and found out what works for them. I’d say that eighty percent of the comedians I work with who are either new or semi-established appear to have just thrown on whatever clothes suit their mood that day. No matter how brilliant they are, I believe that they’re missing out on quite a big part of what makes a first impression.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">In extreme cases, such as Emo Philips, we get a good idea of who he is the moment he walks onstage. This is different to more traditional stand-up as his persona is so otherworldly that he can make a bigger instant impression than a traditional comedian can, because of the way he moves and the ridiculous outfits he wears. That doesn’t justify traditional comedians hugely varying their onstage image depending on their mood or the weather that day. If your mood varies considerably whenever you get dressed to do a gig, but your material stays the same, you’re obviously at risk of getting something wrong. Can you imagine seeing Katherine Ryan or Jack Dee onstage at an outdoor theatre in August, wearing shorts and flip-flops?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Often, as a comedian’s style evolves, so does their look. If your material starts to change, it’s a good idea to at least consider changing your appearance too (no matter how subtle). What does your look tell your audience about you? Does it complement your persona? Does it clash with it in a way that makes it funnier, or does it clash in a way that takes something away from it? Is there a chance for that outfit to make your material work even better for you? Will you just throw on anything, the way we all get dressed on a normal day? Who exactly are you, and what message can you instantly get across to express that before you’ve even opened your mouth? Just because doing this is much easier for otherworldly comedians, small details can still add up to work for or against you.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, think about those details because your audience will be staring at you for a lot longer than you ever will be. If you’re not taking advantage of that you’d better smell funny, because that’s a hell of a waste of one of their senses. You might be thinking <i class="calibre3">‘Jerry Seinfeld walks onstage in a suit, takes the mic out of the stand and just starts talking. So, why should I bother doing anything different?’</i> You<i class="calibre3"> </i>don’t<i class="calibre3"> </i>have to. However, Seinfeld acknowledges that comedians should strive to find the harmony between their material, personality, face, body and movement. So, don’t focus on any thoughts that seem to suggest that a point might not be valid; focus on the idea that you could possibly be doing more to give your audience a stronger first impression.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">What’s believable and not believable for you to talk about doing? Tommy Cooper looks like he’s clumsy, so it’s believable when he is. When I mention having OCD that leads to me counting things, I can see my audience thinking <i class="calibre3">‘Yeah, I can picture that’.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Maybe you don’t appear to have any flaws, but little quirks can enhance the flaws that your material suggests you have. This doesn’t have to mean shifting to the acting side of comedy and becoming a character comedian. It can involve slightly exaggerating your quirks by adjusting the graphic equaliser to your own personality. No matter how much a comedian appears to be being themselves onstage, they’re still playing the part of a comedian.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">As I brushed on earlier, there’s a definite trend in comedians from the US being high status and British comedians being far more likely to be low status. I believe this is because we’re all influenced by the cultures that we live in and Americans tend to love winners, while Brits tend to prefer an underdog.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">In 2021 I wrote an article for the comedy website Chortle.co.uk about the major cultural difference between Britain and the US, and how those cultures affect their respective comedians and sitcoms:</p>
      <p class="implicit-break1"></p>
      <p class="first1 pcalibre"><span class="first-phrase">Status Symbolism</span></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Adam Bloom on how the Americans love a winner, and Brits love a loser</p>
      <p class="subsq1">A few years ago, I was backstage at the Comedy Store in London. A visiting full-time American comedian was doing a guest spot. He handed a small piece of card to the MC with some writing on it and said, <i class="calibre3">‘Do you get any of these shows over here?’</i> he was basically asking her to big him up in his intro. She shook her head and said, <i class="calibre3">‘We don’t do that over here’</i>. What the visiting comedian didn’t realise was that she was doing him a favour.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">British comedians don’t ask MCs to list all their TV credits before bringing them to the stage because it actually works against them. American audiences like to be told they’re being given a winner and, even if they haven’t seen any of the TV appearances mentioned, they are excited to find out just how good that comedian is, whereas we Brits like to think that &ndash; if we haven’t already heard of someone &ndash; they’re an uncredited talent and that we’ve just discovered them. That hugely significant cultural difference is something that anyone who’s performed in both countries will know. I’ve experienced the results of this rule being broken from both sides of the stage in England. Very occasionally, a younger MC who grew up watching the stand-up shows I did in the Nineties will excitedly mention one or two of my TV credits whilst introducing me, and the audience inevitably give me a smaller round of applause than the previous comedians that night and I’ve learned that I have to open by undermining my apparent fame to undo the damage that the MC has just done. When I first went to see live comedy as an audience member four years before I ever did stand-up, the brilliant Tony Allen was introduced as ‘a comedy legend’. I can clearly remember feeling contempt for him, thinking ‘Well, I certainly haven’t heard of you’. This simply does not happen with US audiences because they inherently like winners and &ndash; unlike British audiences &ndash; therefore tend to gravitate towards high status comedians. It got me thinking about status in US comedians and our cultural differences.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Dave Chappelle is about as successful as you can be as a stand-up and is clearly very high status because, just like Chris Rock, he tells you the answers to life. They may both be asking for our empathy when revealing vulnerable truths about their pasts, but they are almost never the victim of their stories (apart from in Chris Rock’s Netflix special <i class="calibre3">‘Tamborine’</i>, of course, which was a complete style and status change). They may both mention having grown up poor, but they make it very clear that they are rich now, making them winners. Chappelle’s ‘<i class="calibre3">So, I kicked her in the…</i>’ routine is crammed with asking for our empathy for him as a child, but starts and ends with ludicrously high status claims with him talking about just how easy comedy is for him, and explaining why he <i class="calibre3">‘earns the big bucks’. </i>No low status comedian would ever say either of those things, and coming from humble beginnings certainly doesn’t override that behaviour. It may make it easier for some people to accept it, but given that Chappelle also talks about specifically not being from the ‘hood, he clearly doesn’t go out of his way to get our sympathy. Chappelle even managed to be high status when opening a Netflix special with a story about being booed by his audience, arrogantly correcting the press who said he was booed off, stating that he ‘<i class="calibre3">was booed, but did not leave</i>’. So, even when explaining that an audience turned on him, he still manages not to be the victim. He even once smoked onstage at a Golden Globes ceremony and pointed out to an audience of celebrities that he couldn’t be ejected from the theatre because of how important he was to the evening. This remark shows zero humility and as a joke is purely about his extremely high status.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The Blue Collar Comedy Tour of Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Ron White and Larry The Cable Guy may seem like a bill of very low status comedians. However, they famously perform to an audience of rednecks. So, their audiences are actually laughing at themselves and not the comedian, which is very different to the way British audiences laugh at a low status comedian such as Lee Evans. On top of that, the stadium-filling multi-millionaires onstage clearly don’t live like rednecks any more.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The late comic genius Mitch Hedberg may have seemed weird or stoned, giving him a lower status than the average, confident, suit-wearing American comedian. However, when you study his jokes, he was still a winner. He made sure he was almost never the victim of his jokes, unlike Milton Jones who asks us to laugh at his mistakes even though, deep-down, we know he’s being clever. Milton is an idiot savant, something British audiences love because he turns his cleverness on himself, asking the audience to laugh at him rather than with him when he frequently gets life wrong. Mitch gets it right, albeit from a strange perspective.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Bill Burr is arguably as high status a comedian as anyone. He not only wins nearly every time, he often even starts routines by telling you how clever he is just before he goes on to prove it in depth. No British comedian does this because it would lack humility and vulnerability, causing their public to be at least slightly put off by them.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Jerry Seinfeld is unapologetically high status. He looks slick and stands above us all as he tells us how it is. Michael McIntyre is the closest we have to Seinfeld with regard to success, style and status. However, there’s a subtle yet profound difference. McIntyre’s act-outs generally involve him failing to cope with everyday life to bring himself down a peg or two.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">It often used to puzzle me how someone so self-assured could become so loved by the British public because I’m aware how important vulnerability is to UK audiences. Then it suddenly occurred to me that his vulnerability is in his material, not his persona. He’s a slick, super-confident, posh bloke&nbsp;who is failing to cope with daily life. Bingo. Jimmy Carr may well be permanently high status, but he actually became famous as a TV panel show host, which is a very high status role.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There are obviously exceptions to every rule, but the only two hugely successful low status American comedians I can think of are Woody Allen and Amy Schumer. Allen’s stand-up career was over sixty years ago, and Schumer being the only female comedian on this list makes me wonder if Americans embrace a woman struggling with daily life easier than they would a man. This pattern also applies to sitcoms. Seinfeld is the US’ richest comedian as a result of his self-titled sitcom, whereas Britain’s richest comedian is Rowan Atkinson because of Mr Bean. The two exceptions that spring to mind are <i class="calibre3">Sanford and Son</i> and the US version of <i class="calibre3">The Office</i>, which are both remakes of British TV shows. It’s safe to say that Del Boy, Alan Partridge, Edina Monsoon and David Brent are all adored by the British public and are all complete failures. Now picture them replacing any four of the cast members in the opening title sequence to the sitcom ‘Friends’. It’s not possible, is it?</p>

      <p class="first1">The perfect punchline can only exist if it’s coming from the right persona, and I believe that is the single most important thing a comedian needs to know. Woody Allen managed to sum this up in one sentence:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">“A comedian is a funny person doing material, and not a person doing funny material”.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Of course you ultimately want both, and it’s certainly worth crafting material to perfection because that’s a huge part of the art form, but the real comedy comes from within you. Despite my lifelong obsession with jokes and their structure and flow, a comedian’s material still only serves to enhance the magic that comes from within them. As much as it may seem that your material makes you funny, <span class="underline">you</span> actually make your material funny. The perfect joke is semi-redundant if it doesn’t suit your persona. In some cases, it can even be damaging.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I see jokes as leaves growing out of a tree. That tree is your persona and the leaves are your material. This is why the tree should ultimately exist first, as it’s the foundation for your material. It is possible for a comedian to build a persona around their material once they start to see a pattern forming in the attitude within that material, but doing it that way round ultimately means they’ve been performing without a persona for a while. That’s okay as a way to grow, as long as the persona is eventually found. I honestly believe that an average joke that’s in character for a comedian to say is far better than an outstanding joke that’s out of character, especially if it contradicts who their audience have decided they are.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, what about a great joke that’s neither in character nor damaging to your style? Often a comedian will try a line out in a dressing-room or car journey to or from a gig, and someone will nod and say, ‘<i class="calibre3">That</i>’<i class="calibre3">s a great joke</i>’. However, very often that’s all it is, and yet no one flags that up because they’re not imagining that comedian saying it onstage.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Remember, no matter how great a joke, routine or story is &ndash; if it’s not you, it’s not great. Yes, audiences will laugh, but it’s just another two-dimensional moment onstage that lacks layers. You want to get to a point where someone will be able to recognise your material when they hear it quoted by someone else or, even better, it only works when you deliver it. I say this because a very quotable joke is a credit to a comedian’s writing, but a joke that only they can sell is a credit to the harmony between their writing and persona; a funny person doing unique material. We’ll look a lot more at the harmony between material and persona later on.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">We’ve all experienced a friend quoting a line from a comedian they recently saw and, when no one laughs, someone will say <i class="calibre3">‘Yeah, it’s all in the delivery’.</i> Delivery obviously plays a huge part, but even if they’d delivered it with impeccable timing, what would still be missing is that comedian’s persona. The reason pub jokes work is because they’re told in the third person, which is why the personality of the person telling it isn’t relevant. You might tell a stranger a joke that starts with <i class="calibre3">‘A crab walks into a barber shop…’.</i> So, it’s about the crab and not you. If the joke was about you and was funny because of how <span class="underline">you</span> reacted in a specific situation, then the person you’re telling it to would need to know something about you first. This is exactly why pub jokes work and quoting a comedian often doesn’t.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Everyone understands what a film plot involves, which is why they’ll set up an entire scene before quoting a line from that film. Since persona is a far more subtle thing than a scene in a film, a comedian’s persona is very often overlooked when people quote them.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here comes my point. Sometimes, watching a comedian who doesn’t have a definable persona doing good material is tantamount to turning on your TV halfway through a film, because that comedian has no persona (their back-story). No matter how subtle a comedian’s persona is, it’s their back-story. So, when a comedian without a definable persona spends several hours a day searching for that ‘special’ joke that they believe is going to make them funnier, they’re simply searching in the wrong place.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">During my first month or so as a comedian I was pretending to be Ben Elton because I’d overdosed on him as a teenager, and was therefore heavily influenced by his comedy. Luckily I soon shed my skin and, if you’re emulating someone else, you must start to do the same. Sometimes it can be glaringly obvious who someone’s favourite comedian is from watching them onstage and, at worst, it’s painful to watch. I do, however, believe that it’s forgivable to emulate your heroes when you’re very new, if it gives you the confidence to stand onstage the first ten to twenty times. Although it’s certainly not ideal, it’s at least a start. All I’d say is make sure that 100% of the material is your own, and that you soon experiment with finding your own voice.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When I was starting out, of the 100-150 new comedians I worked with, very few appeared with fully formed personas. Peter Kay, Ed Byrne and Sarah Millican are the three names that spring to mind. The rest of us found our personas gradually over time, going through as many as three stages until we got there. The funny thing is that I eventually ended up being pretty much how I was at nineteen years old, joking with my friends down the pub. It just took a while to find the confidence to be myself onstage.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Looking back at those times, there were a few dozen new comedians who didn’t develop a persona, and almost all of them eventually gave up. Some of them went on to become successful comedy actors, writers and directors, which is wonderful as they found their place in comedy, having decided that stand-up wasn’t for them. Sadly, many talented people stayed with their day jobs. Some of the ones who left comedy had loads of brilliant, quotable material. I’d love to mention them because of their uncredited talent, but that might come across as insulting. Some of their material was so good that it still occasionally pops into my head today and is being quoted backstage by comedians almost thirty years later. However, they were people doing funny material.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">One of my favourite comedians is Ninia Benjamin. I must have worked with her at least twenty-five times. She makes me howl every time, and yet I can only quote two or three lines of hers. Whenever I watch Ninia, I’m laughing at the way she sees life and at her relationship with any audience. She’s a force of nature, and therefore any material she does (which is also brilliant) is a bonus. Some of the talented comedians whom I started out with and still quote today who didn’t have definable personas would rarely make audiences more than chuckle. I used to watch them and think, <i class="calibre3">‘That’s an incredible joke’.</i> No matter how many people are watching a comedian and thinking that a line is incredible, you can’t hear those thoughts and it breaks my heart to think that many of those comedians aren’t using their talents to make a living.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">My favourite comedian is Sean Lock, who sadly died of cancer in 2021. He always had the most incredibly inventive ideas while often managing to make intelligent social commentary at the same time. However, I saw him doing stand-up when he was very ill and, although the material was uniquely brilliant as always, something was missing. Then it hit me; since he wasn’t at all well, that murderous glint in his eye wasn’t there any more. It may seem like a tiny detail, yet that missing glint made him seem far more vulnerable, which didn’t suit his material.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, how can you tell if your persona is defined? I’ve come up with a simple test that you can do on yourself right now. I’ve always believed that whenever you think of a comedian, you should be able to describe their persona in three words. This is not to be confused with three styles of material. Here are some examples to give you an idea of what I mean:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6"><b class="calibre4">Lee Evans &ndash; </b>Manic, clumsy, childlike</li>
        <li class="calibre6"><b class="calibre4">Steven Wright &ndash; </b>Lethargic, pensive, otherworldly</li>
        <li class="calibre6"><b class="calibre4">Joan Rivers &ndash; </b>Acerbic, confrontational, volatile</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">You might want to replace one of those words with a word that you feel is more suitable for how you perceive any of those comedians; all I care is that you understand my point. I want you to try to do that with yourself now. Take your time, though. Hopefully it’ll come to you within a few minutes.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you could instantly make a list of three words that describe your persona and you feel they’re accurate, that’s wonderful news. If not, don’t worry, it might take a while to pinpoint the right words and, once you do, you will be able to grow by leaning towards these characteristics onstage. If you can’t, at least you’re now aware of this and can put some thought into it soon.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Let’s double check that we’re talking about persona and not style of material<i class="calibre3">.</i> The reason I emphasised this is because so many comedians confuse the two. So, to get those three words, you must focus on defining your persona in its purest form. Only then can you decide what leaves to hang on your tree, occasionally slipping into a third style to add depth to your persona.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">A good example of the difference between style and persona is that I would never describe a comedian’s persona as <i class="calibre3">‘self-deprecating’,</i> and neither should you. Someone who <span class="underline">doesn’t</span> understand the difference between style and persona might make this list to describe someone’s persona:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Self-deprecating, quiet, observational</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s important to understand why this is wrong. A comedian whose persona suggests low self-esteem might quietly deliver self-deprecating observations which reaffirm that character trait. Once you fully understand the difference between style and persona, you can focus on fine-tuning your persona until it’s fully ready to hang the perfect material on it, taking your comedy to the next level.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Despite how it may seem, <b class="calibre4">material does <span class="underline">not</span> define your persona, it reaffirms it</b>. Persona is primarily in your energy, attitude, movement, facial expressions, the look in your eye and, in some cases, the way you hold the microphone. This is why I mentioned searching in the wrong place for that ‘special’ joke.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is how I look at the harmony between a comedian’s material and their persona. Imagine someone standing in a pitch-black room, holding a flashing torch that’s pointing away from their body. That person is your persona. You can’t see that person at all, just the flashing light from the torch. If they start waving the torch around and randomly pointing it at different parts of their body, anyone watching will eventually get an exact image in their mind’s eye of what that person looks like, despite only seeing them one section of a body part at a time. If the torch is waved around long enough, they’ll soon be able to see the entire person, even though you haven’t once seen them with the light on.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Yes, the flashes are that comedian’s material. A<i class="calibre3"> </i>comedian who knows exactly who they are (and understands the value of that) never wastes time pointing the torch away from their body. When you look at it this way, why would they? Every single flash either tells us or reconfirms something about that comedian’s persona, no matter how subtle. A torch shining away from your body for too long means that everyone watching you will start to lose sight of the image they were building up in their minds.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is why, whenever I come up with a new bit of material, it has to pass what I call the ‘torch test’, and for your material to consistently pass that test, you not only need to have a persona, you need to understand it. The ‘Greats’ in comedy have such ridiculously defined personas that they’ve reached the stage where not only does every single thing they say shine a torch on their bodies, every single movement they make does too. This, of course, develops over time, but they all got there and that can only happen by thinking about detail.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’ve seen early footage of many world class comedians where they’ve done material that showed a slightly different side to them to the one we’re used to seeing today. That’s because they’ve since refined their persona again and again until they reached something that’s a truly beautiful thing to behold. It’s all about tweaking, and if you don’t tweak, nothing will change &ndash; and that change simply cannot happen with an <i class="calibre3">‘I know, but it works’</i> attitude.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now you know how I view what material does for persona, imagine what goes through my mind when I watch a comedian whose set is peppered with stories about funny things other people have said. I once watched a comedian quote their funny dad so many times that, at one point, I wondered if I could buy a ticket to see their dad instead. We’ll talk about ideas for when it comes to quoting other people later on.</p>

      <p class="subsq1">What if your persona is based in the real world and from a ‘normal’ person’s perspective, but you want to share obscure thoughts and ideas without building reality bridges? To recap, that’s merging reality with fantasy. You can achieve this with one simple thing, a hypothesis. I have created hundreds of obscure premises that would be damaging to my persona if I’d claimed they had actually happened. So, I put all my obscure premises within hypothetical situations by simply starting routines with phrases like:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Do you know what I’d do if I had enough time and money?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">or:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I was thinking, what if that </i>hadn’t<i class="calibre3"> happened…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">or:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘It’s as if that person was thinking…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The key word is <i class="calibre3">‘if’</i> &ndash; or any phrase that suggests that you’re not claiming something happened. That way, your comedy can still be based in reality, and yet you’re free to present any obscure ideas you want because you’re only asking your audience to imagine how those situations would look, or feel as if they happened.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s a third category which is a hybrid of reality and fantasy, and that’s to only come out of reality on a punchline. This is a method I use all the time. For example, we know that I would never say ‘<i class="calibre3">The other day my head fell off</i>’. However, I can tell a true story that ends on a punchline involving misdirection that ends with an obscure mental image of something the audience know I’d never do, such as wrapping my cat in Sellotape. Since it happens on the twist, the fact that it’s clearly not true adds to the impact of the punchline. The audience know they’ve just been slapped. So, as unrealistic as that new mental image is, it happened in a flash and the joke is over. In this case, since it’s advice on what to do with your cat, I’m not claiming to have actually done anything.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">However, let’s say I <span class="underline">had</span> claimed to have actually wrapped my cat in Sellotape; I wouldn’t ever continue with:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Then, I picked my cat up and unwrapped it…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is because, since my comedy is based in reality, the joke has to end the moment I’ve slapped the audience with something unrealistic. Many comedians’ comedy is so strongly based in reality that they wouldn’t even say something unrealistic on a punchline. They’d only talk about their thoughts on the world around them, things that happened, and present ‘what if…?’ hypothetical situations. So, nothing they ever claim to have happened isn’t feasible.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Words like <i class="calibre3">‘if’</i> and ‘<i class="calibre3">I was thinking’</i> are also bridges, but they’re bridges between your world and where you want to hypothetically take your audience, and they’re very easy to build.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Which of these do you do?</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Real world and stays there</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Real world with hypothetical situations</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Real world with hypothetical situations and unrealistic punchlines</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Real world that merges into fantasy world</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Fantasy world</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">You need to make the choice and stick to it once you’ve decided what works for you. I don’t mean stick to it forever &ndash; feel free to change styles as you find your voice.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">You might be thinking <i class="calibre3">‘But, if I tell a story involving my head falling off, surely the audience will know it’s not true’.</i> Yes, they will, but you’re asking them to suspend their disbelief that it happened, so are dragging them into a fantasy world, which is absolutely fine as long as you’re happy to be perceived as someone in a fantasy world. Reality bridges merge truth with fantasy if the joins are seamless, but if you follow a story about the time your head fell off by saying <i class="calibre3">‘I got mugged the other day’</i>,<i class="calibre3"> </i>don’t be surprised if you don’t get the appropriate empathy.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Dressing weirdly strongly suggests that you’re about to take us somewhere weird. I watched the incredibly gifted comedian Milton Jones transform from being a normal person in the real world to a very weird person in the real world, presenting the audience with absurd hypothesis and occasionally sliding into a complete fantasy world which worked beautifully for him, because we’d already suspended our disbelief that he was weird enough to have ludicrous things actually happen to him. Milton’s change in persona happened close to overnight. However, his change in style of material was gradual. Here’s the fascinating part; he still told many of the jokes that he’d used before his change in persona, but as soon as he messed up his hair, wore crazy jumpers and had that otherworldly look in his eye, those same jokes were catapulted into a far more exciting place. This is the best example I can possibly give of the harmony between material and persona. Milton soon went on to write more material that suited his new persona (leaves from a tree) and his career also catapulted.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s a thought on how powerful subtle changes can be. Although Milton’s hairstyle and outfits did wonders for his image, if you take that otherworldly expression away, the moment he walks onstage (before he speaks) his audience would see a normal bloke dressed badly. However, if you stick him in a normal outfit, but he has that otherworldly look in his eyes, the audience would instantly perceive him as weird. All three of those things obviously work to complement each other and, together with his outstandingly well-written and otherworldly material, the result is a true comedian. I don’t know anyone who made quite as big a shift as Milton did. However, that shift can be subtle. For me, it was going from wearing all black and not smiling to wearing colourful clothes and smiling a lot. Suddenly, the playful side that already existed in my material became far more apparent because my outfit and energy were matching it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Are you one shift away from putting a new spin on everything you do? Would doing slightly more of some of the things that you already do or say take your comedy to the next level? It’s exciting to think about it, and doesn’t have to involve messing up your hair. One different item of clothing and a slight change in your stance can make a big difference if they both work in harmony with your persona. Hold a magnifying glass over the things that make you, ‘you’. In a way, that’s what being a stand-up comedian is &ndash; finding your uniqueness and zooming in on it.</p>

      <p class="first1">There are so many things that a comedian can do before they speak into a microphone, and yet the vast majority of them simply walk up to it, take it out of the stand and put the stand aside.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I remember the first time I watched Denis Leary’s show, <i class="calibre3">No Cure for Cancer</i>; although he opened with a song, the very first thing he did at the start of the stand-up part of the show was walk to the front of the stage, dragging the mic stand on the floor behind him. He did it like a child dragging their school bag home, showing no respect for the bag or pavement that it’s scraping against. It was a brilliantly subtle glimpse into his attitude towards life that he was about to reveal.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Dylan Moran gently shakes the microphone, giving the impression that he’s slightly drunk. Gavin Webster occasionally holds the microphone side-on and taps it hard twice, giving the impression that he’s not used to being onstage, momentarily behaving more like an electrician than a comedian. All these things are brilliant details that reaffirm their personas. To me, detail is everything and the best comedians have peppered their shows with it from start to finish, having thought it through. Assuming you know of their work, can you imagine Lee Evans dragging a mic stand across a stage, or Bob Monkhouse tapping a microphone to check that it’s on?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I once saw a new comedian who had a defined, grumpy persona. After her first two lines which set up that she didn’t like being onstage, she subtly looked at her watch. This was so beautiful because it confirmed the idea that she didn’t want to be there. No one checks their watch thirty seconds into a gig, because they clearly know how long they’ve been onstage. On that subject, it’s a very bad habit to be seen looking at your watch. I’ve been guilty of it, and it really gives the impression that you’ve got other places you need to be. It can be effective if it’s followed by an enthusiastic <i class="calibre3">‘I haven’t got much time left’</i> because that can add to the audience’s excitement, causing them to want to make the most of their time with you. However, if an audience is having fun, time doesn’t exist until you draw their attention to it. So, unless you’ve got a reason to be seen looking at your watch as a result of thinking it through, allow your audience to get lost in the moment. Purpose-built comedy clubs tend to have a light somewhere in the room that only the person onstage can see, and the sound technician will be happy to give you a light a few minutes before the end of your set or show. If not, you can ask someone to flash the torch on their phone at you two to three minutes before the end of your gig.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Do you just walk to the mic, take it out of the stand, put the stand to one side and then start your set? If you do, that’s fine, but what else could you do to subtly get your persona across? Here’s a list of different things for you to consider applying your uniqueness to before you even speak:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">The way you address the mic or mic stand</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The way you greet the MC</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The way you acknowledge your audience</li>
        <li class="calibre6">A specific introduction for the MC to give you</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Specific walk-on music</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The way you walk or move as you approach the mic</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">The last one might look like I’m suggesting some form of clowning and that’s certainly an option if it suits you, but the way you walk or move can also be extremely subtle. It can be a downward glance, or a scratch of an ear. Your opening line that follows will then work in harmony with those quirks. Isn’t it a lovely thought that you can walk into a room of complete strangers and choose exactly how they’ll perceive you within a few seconds?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I often watch a comedian take up to three minutes to do and say enough to get their persona across. Ultimately, every single line you say should either add something to or reaffirm an audience’s impression of who you are. So, wouldn’t it be wonderful if your opening lines did, too?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here are two classic examples:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">Jack Dee (grumpy, cynical, superior)</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">(In response to huge applause) ‘Thanks for that. You weren’t to know I’ve got a headache’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">Emo Philips (idiot savant, misfit, otherworldly)</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">(At his debut performance in London) ‘Aah. It’s great to be in…doors’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look closer at these lines to see if they work in harmony with both comedians’ personas and styles (persona in bold, style underlined):</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">The way Jack Dee points out that he’s got a headache sets up that he’s <b class="calibre4">grumpy</b>. Plus, the words ‘<i class="calibre3">Thanks for that’</i> soon reveal that he’s being <span class="underline">sarcastic</span></li>
        <li class="calibre6">Emo Philips sets up that he’s a <b class="calibre4">misfit</b> by <span class="underline">misdirecting</span> his audience and revealing that he’s just spent the entire day wandering the streets</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Emo Philips is known for incredibly inventive lines that create strong mental images. So, you might feel that I didn’t choose the best example. The reason I chose that line was because of its brevity. In case it doesn’t come across in print, his audience assumed he was going to say:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘It’s great to be in…London’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is a ridiculously economical joke. The twist after the misdirection (the balloon pop) happens on the final syllable of the final word. I could quote far stronger material by both of these comedians, but these are perfect opening lines. Once they’re delivered, the real magic starts to happen. Notice that Jack Dee’s opening line is about what happened seconds before he started speaking, adding an air of spontaneity to the line. Emo’s opening line is slightly different as he obviously didn’t arrive in the country that minute. However, he’s still acknowledging his current situation &ndash; that he’s an American visiting London. These comedians obviously have an advantage over most comedians because their audiences already know who they are. However, that doesn’t mean that these opening lines would fail to an audience who don’t know who they were. Emo Philips wore an outfit that worked in perfect harmony with his opening line (Google Image him if you don’t know what he looks like). Although you can’t possibly tell from a smart suit that Jack Dee is grumpy, the expression on his face certainly lets you know. Plus, his smart suit and the way he walks onstage both set up that he’s high status.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">An opening line can achieve more than just set up your persona, it can also challenge what an audience might be thinking. At a late show at The London Comedy Store during the early 2000s (when female comedians were still a small minority), I saw brilliant Australian comedian Kitty Flanagan walk onstage as the only female comedian on the bill. She took the mic out of the stand, looked down at the floor and cynically mimicked the audience by saying:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Oh, great. A chick. This better be good’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">It was masterful. She’d instantly challenged the audience by impersonating anyone who had prejudices against female comedians. It completely disarmed those people and, as a result, they instantly loved her.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If your style is conversational, badly chosen opening lines can feel like a ‘needle hitting the record’ moment. I believe that a conversational comedian’s aim should be that it isn’t noticeable that their opening is actually a joke. Here are some methods for achieving that:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Write a bespoke opening line about what’s just happened in the room</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Request a specific introduction and then make a comment about the way you’ve been introduced</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Make a spontaneous comment about the way you’ve been introduced</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s also a very nice technique to walk onstage without any agenda as you approach the mic. If your mind is completely clear, it’s free to think of something in the moment. So, rather than walking onstage focused on exactly what you’re planning to say, if your head’s completely clear, it’s much easier to say the first thought to enter it. This comment could be about the room, how you’re feeling or, assuming you’re being introduced, what the MC said when they introduced you. Admittedly, this takes extreme confidence, but that can only exist by doing it. The good news is that, if you have a strong opening line to follow it, that line acts as your safety net. An audience will always allow a comedian at least two punchlines before deciding that they’re possibly not funny. So, one ad lib at the start isn’t going to blow it for you.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">A skilful MC will often start a show without seeming to be doing anything. They’ll walk onstage and genuinely say the first few thoughts to come into their head, and eventually slide into material completely unnoticed. This is a skill that very few comedians have, and why those people tend to gravitate towards MCing. No matter how little you plan to improvise during your career and no matter how conversational your material may sound, I strongly recommend that you still MC a few gigs early on in your career to at least give yourself the confidence to react naturally when something happens that’s out of your control. That way, when it does happen, such as someone dropping a tray of drinks, you’ll be far less likely to return to your set with the words <i class="calibre3">‘Anyway, back to my set’.</i> That’s a major boom mic moment. Think it, but don’t say it. Train yourself to use words like <i class="calibre3">‘anyway’</i> or <i class="calibre3">‘so’</i> and then carry on with your set. We’ll look at this moment closer in the chapter on improvising. Basically, anything is better than bridging improv and material with a sentence that includes the words <i class="calibre3">‘material’</i> or <i class="calibre3">‘my set’.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Opening a set or show with a joke is fine, just be aware that you’ve as good as just told your audience that you’ll be telling jokes. The only exception I can think of is the supremely gifted Doug Stanhope, who’ll sometimes open an hour show with a two-line joke and then go on to do an hour of opinionated, thought-provoking and dark comedy. However, that opening line will still set up that his comedy is going to be dark. You might be thinking <i class="calibre3">‘Why didn</i>’<i class="calibre3">t you quote one of your own opening lines?’ </i>This is simply because I can’t compete with the ones we looked at. My ‘cat and Sellotape’ line is playful and sets up that I’ll be using misdirection. Plus, it sort of refers to what’s just happened (me getting dressed for the gig). So, it’s pretty good, but I don’t think I can compete with the examples I’ve used. However, with regard to first impressions, the moment my name is announced, I march quickly to the stage with both arms in the air, cheering like an excited child, dressed in colourful clothes. I’ve already given two strong impressions before I’ve started talking: I’m very excitable, and I’ve got so much to say that I don’t want to waste a second.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">I want you to consider these things to potentially achieve within your first thirty seconds onstage:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Your outfit can set up your persona</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The way you approach the mic (no matter how subtle) can set up your persona</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Your opening line can set up your persona</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Your opening line can set up your style of comedy</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">You don’t <span class="underline">have</span> to do all of these things, but it’s no coincidence that almost all of the ‘Greats’ do. So, it’s just a case of knowing where the bar is, and either trying to reach it or not bothering and risking making a mediocre first impression.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now it’s time for you to think about your first impression. Don’t worry if you can’t achieve all four things straight away, it’s just something to aim for. Having seen a breakdown of just how much these giants of stand-up can achieve within a few seconds of being onstage, I’ve hopefully inspired you to possibly write a brand-new, bespoke, much stronger opening line. No, it’s not easy, but being restricted will help. Have you already thought about who you are and what your main two styles are? Either way, sit down and go over your existing material (that includes material for your first ever gig) to see if anything works as a perfect opening line. If not, write something brand-new. Necessity will make this easier, since you’ll be restricted to getting both your style and persona across at the same time. That list of four things is the goal, but two or three of them will still be very effective. Do it now.</p>

      <p class="first1">A lot of material I listen to is well-written and funny, but feels like I’ve heard it before. Many comedians don’t worry about this, because all they care is that their material works. This is a very slippery slope.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The difference between good and great isn’t just down to attention to detail, it’s about the originality of the thought that sparked that material. Many comedians justify derivative material with the age-old answer <i class="calibre3">‘Yeah, but there are only seven jokes in the world’.</i> There are only twenty-six letters in the alphabet, but the range of books written using those letters is pretty wide. So, it’s probably fair to say that anyone who believes there are only seven jokes in the world hasn’t written eight. When a comedian comes up with an idea and chooses to overlook the fact that it’s derivative, they’re allowing their quality bar to slip. Although audiences aren’t anywhere near as aware of derivative material as most comedians are, they can certainly sense when they’re watching an original comedian. For the word <i class="calibre3">‘original’</i> to come out of your audience’s mouths when they talk about you, your material and persona cannot be derivative. So, just because the vast majority of people who pay to watch live comedy aren’t comedians, it doesn’t mean that originality goes unnoticed.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">In fact, one of the things I love about my industry is that live stand-up comedy (not to be confused with comedy on TV) is as close to a meritocracy as you can get within the arts. Look at the music industry; there are tens of thousands of struggling musicians and singers in this country who are far more talented than half the ones we’ve all heard of. Luckily, my dad made a living, but it used to break my heart whenever he’d tell me that someone he’d just worked with was one of the best musicians he’d seen in fifty years and, on one occasion, the best. Yet these people were barely making a living. I can’t think of one highly respected comedian who makes less than an okay living.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When it comes to staying original, here are the three questions that always go through my mind whenever I have a new idea:</p>
      <ol class="calibre7">
        <li value="1" class="calibre6">Does it fit my voice?</li>
        <li value="2" class="calibre6">Could anyone have thought of it?</li>
        <li value="3" class="calibre6">Does it remind me of something I’ve heard before?</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="subsq1">The first is obviously the most important, but if it’s the only question you ask yourself when you come up with a new bit of material, you’re in danger of becoming bland.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I believe that Steven Wright is the greatest joke-writer alive and ninety-nine percent of what I’ve heard him say onstage doesn’t sound remotely like anything I’ve ever heard another comedian say. His persona is unique too. Despite his ability, he’s still capable of having an unoriginal thought. So, those three questions have to go through his mind, to make sure that his ridiculously high bar stays that high.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">You might be thinking <i class="calibre3">‘I do observational comedy, isn’t that different?’</i> Not really, because that just means your observations need to be that more astute than most people’s (ultimately more astute than anyone else’s) and the same applies to your act-outs.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Soon after mobile phones went hands-free, I saw three different comedians make the exact same observation about them. Not only that, all three routines twisted in exactly the same direction<i class="calibre3">.</i> So, they clearly didn’t ask themselves the ‘three questions’. They might not have even asked themselves any of them, just a question on a list of one:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">“Does it work?”</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">A very common technique used by comedians is to make a point funny by ending it with an analogy. This is obviously fine if the outcome is a killer punchline, but I believe that the reason so many comedians use analogies is because they’re a technique that we’ve all applied in conversation for most of our lives. Here are my thoughts on analogies, metaphors and similes in comedy:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">A:</b>  In their most basic form they’re very easy to create</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">B:</b>  They’re done to death</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">C:</b>  When used well, they can be an effective way to make a point</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Since they can be a very effective way to illustrate a point, I often use them to explain my methods and theories, and I hope you’ve found them helpful. ‘A’ &amp; ‘B’ are why I tend to avoid them in my comedy.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Don’t get me wrong, I’ve seen many brilliant comedians use them so well that they’ve not only made me howl with laughter, they’ve even occasionally changed my opinion on the serious topic that they’re addressing. What I want you to take from this is to only use analogies, metaphors or similes if they either have some texture to them (rather than being a simplistic parallel) or they allow you to absolutely nail a point. Some comedians get away with simplistic similes to illustrate bland observations that don’t reinforce anything about their personas or styles and that’s route one comedy. I’d also suggest using them sparingly. Watching a comedian use three analogies within ten minutes starts to feel like I’m not even watching a comedian, more someone holding a pencil and a protractor.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The year that comedian Rich Hall moved to London from the US, I remember being in awe of him during a routine he did that described what it was like being a comedian once the gig is over and he returns to his normal life. There was a huge surprise when Rich revealed the end of the simile because, even though he’d started by telling us that he was about to explain what it was like being a comedian offstage, the simile was so descriptive that, by the time he’d got to the end of it, we’d forgotten that it was one. The audience loved it because it was articulate, intelligent and gave them a peek into his life, and he certainly didn’t achieve that by making a bland observation and then following it up with a simple analogy.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Becoming more original isn’t about smuggling words to create seesaws, it’s about being brutal with what material you keep or get rid of. So, I want you to not only ask yourself those three questions whenever a new idea comes to you, I also want you to ask them about your existing material. I’m not suggesting that you instantly drop half of your material because you’ve decided that anyone could have thought of it, or it reminds you of something you’ve heard before. However, if you ask yourself the question <i class="calibre3">‘Does it fit my voice?’</i> and the answer is <i class="calibre3">‘No’</i>, I am suggesting that you either tweak it (e.g. adjust your status) or drop it. That way, there’ll at least be a consistency to your comedy. Consider all the methods I’ve talked about when you next go over the list of new ideas you haven’t done onstage yet. Imagine creating something brand-new that’s succinct, crammed with detail and suddenly feels like your best line?</p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container2">
          <img alt="" width="600" src="images/000023.jpeg" height="457" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">If you combine all of my methods and theories with your natural talent, there’s absolutely nothing to stop you from rapidly improving &ndash; apart from laziness. If you don’t have a deadline, give yourself a fake deadline and promise yourself that you’ll stick to it. That way, you’ll be forced to avoid letting yourself down.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">My conclusion is to be brave enough to try anything onstage that you feel has potential because, even if it doesn’t work, new ideas provoke new ideas. This is a very important part of my creative process and should not be overlooked. So, whenever you try out new material, record your gig and, if you’re happy with at least some of it, go straight home whilst you’re still buzzing, type it all out and then apply all the techniques we’ve just gone through. Soon you’ll be dropping obvious stuff and anything that doesn’t fit your voice and replacing it with material that does.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">True originality within the comedy industry very rarely goes unnoticed, and there’s no comedy equivalent of a boy band because in comedy, having a good look and a powerful agent will only get you so far before lack of talent gets in the way. No matter how many writers a comedian employs and no matter how advanced artificial intelligence gets (something I wouldn’t touch), there’s no ‘funny bones’ equivalent of Auto-Tune because you still have to stand onstage and be funny.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Another thing I love about stand-up is that it only requires words and an audience. Think of the screenwriter’s journey that involves waiting years to see the final product and, even then, knowing there’s a huge chance that their film won’t ever get made. For us, an entire hour of material doesn’t involve a budget. You can talk about dinosaurs for an hour and it won’t cost you a penny more than a one-liner about a peanut. Doesn’t that make you wanna sing?</p>

          </div>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="title-page-contributor-primary-block" id="calibre_link-120">
      <p class="first1">Virtual comedy is the antithesis of originality because, rather than there being an original joke, there often isn’t one.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">A comedian friend of mine, Rob Heeney, is also a tennis coach. One afternoon, after he’d taught a class of young children, they were all sitting around telling jokes. One of them said:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">“What’s a frog’s favourite game? Leapfrog”.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The children all rolled around laughing. Rob almost had a fit. The comedian in him burst out because he couldn’t cope with the fact that they were laughing at a joke that wasn’t a joke. He passionately explained that the name <i class="calibre3">‘leapfrog’</i> comes from people pretending to be frogs, and the children, who all adored Rob, found his lecture just as funny as the joke because of how emotional he became. Sadly, this situation often happens with stand-up comedy and yet it involves professional comedians telling jokes to adults.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There are three ways to trick an audience into thinking that you’ve created a joke when you haven’t. Making an audience laugh at how witty you are without actually being witty is my least favourite type of comedy, because it arguably isn’t comedy.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’m going to create my own examples for obvious reasons. Before I do, here are the three types of virtual comedy:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">A:</b>  Making a joke about something that’s already a joke</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">B:</b>  Appearing to find a logical flaw in something without 	 understanding why it exists</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">C:</b>  Making an audience laugh by reminding them of something 	 they’ve already laughed at</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although comedy is subjective, once you fully understand what virtual comedy is, in some cases it isn’t even debatable as to whether or not it’s comedy. Here’s an example of ‘A’:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I bought a bottle of shower gel the other day and it said that “7,927 tingling real mint leaves” were packed into it and I thought, wouldn’t it save a lot of time counting them if it just said “Approximately 8,000?”’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I use this brand of shower gel, and when I first saw that label I smiled to myself. It’s a fun and novel idea, and therefore mocking it would be a case of the comedian not getting the joke. So, if this were a genuine example, instead of me making a joke, I’ve failed to get one. When you compare this kind of comedy to the comedians’ lines I’ve quoted and will be quoting, they don’t even exist in the same stratosphere and yet I see comedians getting away with it on the same bill as comedians who come up with genuinely original ideas. On a good night, virtual comedy will work because the audience is in a good mood, have paid to laugh, and it has most of the ingredients of a joke. ‘A’ often happens in the form of the comedian taking a simile literally (‘leapfrog’ is a variation of this). This is at its worst when that simile is already supposed to be funny. When this happens, it feels like the comedian has held a mirror next to a painting and convinced their audience that they’re an artist.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look at a bespoke example of ‘B’:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I saw a sign outside a shop saying, “No dogs, apart from guide dogs” and I thought, what’s the point of that? It’s not like the owner’s going to be reading it’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">It sounds like a joke because it’s about something that’s relatable and, if it’s being presented by someone standing onstage with confidence, boldly claiming that they’ve spotted a flaw in the world around them, the sad thing is that it will work. However, it’s a classic case of finding a flaw in something without understanding why it exists, because those signs are clearly aimed at sighted people with dogs, and possibly sighted people who are accompanying a blind person. If you delivered this line without conviction, your audience would see through it. You might find this a bit harsh of me, and that’s your right. However, it’s a very slippery slope to attempt to find faults in things around you without thinking them through. I’m sure you at least agree that the shower gel joke isn’t witty, and yet I’m confident that the right comedian could make it work for them.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">What ‘A’ &amp; ‘B’ have in common is that they both involve the comedian acting superior to something they don’t understand. Whenever I see this happen, I forgive the audience for laughing because they don’t have time to think about what’s just happened, but I don’t forgive the comedian because they’ve had ages to think about that joke. That may seem equally harsh, but if a joke exists purely because a comedian is proudly pointing out a flaw in something (B), it’s clearly not ideal if it’s actually them who doesn’t ‘get it’. When I compare this type of material to highly astute comedy that causes me to question an element of human behaviour, the comparison makes me even more aware of how much virtual comedy is ripping audiences off.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look at ‘C’ &ndash; making an audience laugh by reminding them of something they’ve already laughed at. This must not be confused with observational comedy, which is a completely different thing because that’s making an audience laugh at something they do or see all the time, but hadn’t thought about until that comedian drew their attention to it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Of the three types of virtual comedy, ‘C’ has the potential to be the only forgivable one, and we’ll look at why in a minute.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">A good example of ‘C’ would be to say something like:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Have you seen The Jerry Springer Show? You get some </i>crazy<i class="calibre3"> people on there’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’ve seen this type of thing done dozens of times, and audiences generally laugh at it. The only joke so far with this example is the audience laughing because they’re remembering laughing at the show itself. So, that’s virtual comedy. If that kind of line springboards onto the comedian doing some creative material, that’s obviously different, but since the show itself is so absurd, that kind of situation allows comedians to coast on that absurdity for laughs and, very often, they haven’t added any artistic input of their own. They just continually remind their audience of funny things they’ve seen. It wouldn’t be fair to label all material that’s about things that are already funny as virtual comedy because there are comedians who add their own spin on the subject.</p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container2">
          <img alt="" width="600" src="images/000024.jpeg" height="338" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">You might be thinking <i class="calibre3">‘What if it’s well-performed?’ </i>That’s also different. However, that performance had better be outstanding, especially if the comedian hasn’t added any content of their own. Otherwise, they’re barely doing anything other than provoking a funny memory. So, a performance in the form of an elaborate act-out of something that’s already funny certainly doesn’t deserve to be compared to ‘A’ or ‘B’, which tend to be two-line jokes that don’t involve any performance and certainly don’t involve any actual wit. A mixture of adding your own spin on something and a brilliant act-out means that there’s more comedy than virtual comedy and that’s obviously fine with me. All I care is that you create <span class="underline">something</span>.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I accept that not all comedy has to be inventive. I know some incredible performers, huge personalities and even a handful of genuine eccentrics who are funny by just existing. However, on its own, virtual comedy gets forgotten because it only causes a knee-jerk reaction. So, again, don’t underestimate an audience’s ability to process comedy and, as a result, forget certain comedians within seconds of them leaving the stage.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When I see a comedian who’s sharing brilliant ideas, astute observations or beautifully crafted stories on the same bill as another one doing ‘A’ or ‘B’, it feels like the first is feeding their audience a nutritious meal and the other is feeding them cardboard. In fact, we could apply ‘A’ to that last sentence:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘The other day, I heard this bloke saying that some comedy is like feeding your audience cardboard. Has anyone here ever eaten cardboard? I don’t know about you, but I’d at least want some ketchup on it. Thank you, enjoy the rest of the show’.</i></b></p>

      <p class="first1">There’s nothing harder than staring at a blank screen and thinking <i class="calibre3">‘What can I think of that’s funny?’</i>, and my goal here is to make those moments considerably easier for you. Each of my BBC Radio 4 series involved me spending nine months of the year regularly sitting at a laptop, working hard at creating brand-new content, which gave me an immense amount of pleasure. However, the hardest part was coming up with the first sentence of each episode.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When it comes to generating new material, I tend to come up with my ideas walking down the street, in conversation with friends, or improvising onstage. However, I’ll sit down at a desk to ghostwrite for another comedian (and even non-comedian), something I’ve spent thousands of hours doing. When it comes to staring at a blank screen, what can you do to get the ball rolling?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Imagine, just for now, that you want to write a simple poem. First of all, you need a topic. That could be literally anything, so where do you start? Okay, you’ve got the topic: buses. What’s the first line? This is the hard part. However, let’s say you start off with:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">I hate waiting for a bus in the pouring rain,</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">You’ve now gone from any topic in the universe to a line about that topic to having to rhyme the next line with <i class="calibre3">‘rain’</i>. This is so much easier than the previous stage, because that restriction leaves you with considerably fewer choices. So, here goes:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">I hate waiting for a bus in the pouring rain,</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">I often wish I’d got the train,</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Thanks to being so restricted, there’s not only a second line, I’m now expressing an emotion: regret. I use exactly the same technique when I sit down to write a brand-new joke. I might look at a topic that I’ve already covered and want to expand on it, or take something that’s relatively new to our lives. By being new, it’ll be slightly easier to have a new thought about it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">For example, nearly every comedian who becomes a parent instantly has material about their baby, because new thoughts pour into their mind overnight. This is why I believe that topical comedians have a slightly easier job than it appears. As impressive as it is when something happens in the news and a comedian has a great routine about it the same day, the truth is that a brand-new situation will spark brand-new thoughts. If that same comedian has the exact same daily routine for a year and suddenly manages to think of a brand-new routine about something they see or do every day, it means they’ve somehow managed to look at that thing differently and, to me, that’s harder to achieve since the only thing that changed was their thought process at that moment.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’m going to demonstrate one of my writing methods now, and I hope it also works for you. Someone I’m writing for has asked me to come up with some material for them about smoking and vaping. Since vaping is newer than smoking, it’s more likely to spark off a newer thought in my head when I think about it (in the same way that nicotine patches did when they came out). So, I’m going to write down a list of the first thoughts that come into my head about vaping.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">By doing this step-by-step you’ll see every thought I have, and the idea is for you to soon use this method yourself. I believe this is a very effective exercise in writing brand-new material from scratch. If what I come up with isn’t good enough, I’ll just keep going. I won’t delete anything, so you’ll see my entire thought process, hopefully from embryo to final product.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, here are the first thoughts to come into my head about vaping:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">There are no lighters or matches involved</li>
        <li class="calibre6">They smell much nicer than cigarettes</li>
        <li class="calibre6">They last much longer than cigarettes</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Smokers say that, if you light a cigarette at a bus stop, a bus always comes</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Vaping in a bar or pub is at the discretion of the owner, as opposed to smoking cigarettes which is illegal</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">The last one sparked a memory. I was in a pub with a friend when vaping was very new, and she asked one of the bartenders if she could vape. He replied, <i class="calibre3">‘I’m not sure, I’ll check with the manager’.</i> She politely waited and, five minutes later, he came back and said <i class="calibre3">‘Yes, it’s fine’.</i> I remember thinking that, since it’s not illegal, she should have just vaped and hope that no one asked her not to. This attitude to rules could be the premise of a joke. Let’s try it now:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Given that vaping isn’t illegal in pubs, why do people ask permission to do it? When I put a song on the jukebox, I don’t go around checking to see if anyone doesn’t like it’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although this will probably work onstage, I find the analogy simplistic. So, it’s a pretty lazy joke. It doesn’t come remotely close to passing the <i class="calibre3">‘Could anyone have thought of it?’</i> test. So many comedians use ‘route one’ analogies to make an audience laugh and, when I see that happening, it’s clear that they’ve taken the <i class="calibre3">‘But, it works’</i> approach.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, back to the weak analogy that I just wrote. Although I clearly don’t like it, I do like the idea of walking around a pub checking to see if anyone doesn’t like the band playing on the jukebox. Not as an analogy, but as a premise. This will, of course, mean that it’s no longer a joke about vaping, but it’ll still be brand-new material, so let’s see where it ends up and chop off the first part:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I’m so neurotic that, before I put a song on a jukebox, I walk around the pub checking to see if anyone doesn’t like it’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Does it suit her voice? No, but since I was supposed to be writing about smoking and vaping, let’s forget that job and carry on with this as an experiment in writing. This line would have to follow a joke, routine or story that involves that comedian displaying signs of being neurotic or panicky, and now is a good time to point out that, if a line is out of character for a comedian to say, it doesn’t necessarily mean they shouldn’t use it. In this situation, you can tangent during a routine or story that momentarily displays a different side to your character. So, rather than bringing it up out of nowhere and risking coming out of character, it’s about only doing that kind of thing once, otherwise you’re at risk of confusing the audience’s general impression of who you are.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Let’s say your comedy is brutal, but you really like a line that you wrote that shows a softer side to your persona. Find a moment within a routine that allows you to momentarily tangent from it to show more empathy than usual by saying something like:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Yeah, I’m not </i>always<i class="calibre3"> this heartless. In fact, the other day…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is not the same as having a third style that complements your main two, it’s about momentarily coming out of character to allow one bit of material to work. So, since you’re briefly painting a different image of yourself, this should only happen once in any given set or show. If a brutal comedian repeatedly tells us how compassionate they are, their brutal material is at risk of no longer seeming believable, and the same applies to a compassionate comedian repeatedly being brutal.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s go back to the jukebox joke and expand on it (new line underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I’m so neurotic that, before I put a song on a jukebox, I walk around the pub checking to see if anyone doesn’t like it. <span class="underline">On my wedding day, when the priest asked if anyone knew of a reason why we shouldn’t get married, I asked the congregation one by one</span>’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The second line could have been used as an analogy. However, now it’s being presented as a fact that’s a continuation of the same character trait, which is a nice way to hide what could have otherwise been an analogy. So, we’ve gone from a list of reasons vaping is different to smoking, and ended up with a brand-new joke about jukeboxes and weddings. The original premise I wrote about doesn’t exist any more, and what’s left is a completely new idea.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Very often, I’ll try an idea onstage that only half-works, but provokes another thought that’s better than the idea I set out to make work. Eventually, the original idea gets dropped and the new idea goes on to become a successful bit of material. I call this method ‘birthing’ because it’s the creative equivalent to two people making a baby, that baby growing into an adult, the two people eventually growing old and dying, leaving an adult behind.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The powerful thing about birthing that must not be overlooked is that it often results in a premise you probably wouldn’t have come up with independently and, since audiences can’t possibly know how that bit of material started its journey, all they see is an original idea. Although most of my birthing happens when I’m improvising around a brand-new bit onstage, the latest jukebox / wedding routine is classic birthing. I wouldn’t usually have a problem with that, as long as it suited that person’s persona. However, since I’d been asked to write material about smoking or vaping, it’s obviously not ideal.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Let’s keep going, purely as an exercise in writing (new line underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I’m so neurotic that, before I put a song on a jukebox, I walk around the pub checking to see if anyone doesn’t like it. On my wedding day, when the priest asked if anyone knew of a reason why we shouldn’t get married, I asked the congregation one by one. <span class="underline">Then it took another hour for everyone to agree on what to play for the first dance</span>’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The topper here is a mini-callback, because it’s referring to something that happened earlier (checking that no one objects to hearing a certain tune) so there’s quite a lot going on, and the actual writing process took less than ten minutes from embryo to final product. Although it would work as a tangent for this comedian, I don’t feel their persona would fully do it justice. I’m not excited about this bit of material, but my objective is solely for you to find the process useful.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Let’s look at the final version purely from the perspective of persona. Could you imagine yourself saying it onstage? If you can, work out exactly why. If you can’t, work out exactly why. This is a great exercise in understanding your own persona. I personally couldn’t use it because the beginning of the punchline (as opposed to a twist at the end) is an unrealistic situation that I’m claiming to have happened. Plus, it’s an unrealistic situation that isn’t being presented as a hypothetical situation, so definitely isn’t right for me.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now read it again, but imagine Woody Allen saying it (unlucky, nervous, neurotic). I’ve tweaked it slightly to suit his persona:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘My therapist says I worry too much about what other people think. Last week, I was at a diner and I put a tune on the jukebox</i>, panicked<i class="calibre3"> and then walked around checking to see if anyone didn’t like it. On my wedding day, when the priest asked if anyone knew of a reason why we shouldn’t get married, I asked the congregation one by one. Then it took another hour for everyone to agree on what to play for the first dance’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">You can hopefully see that the routine suddenly comes to life. This is a perfect example of material working in harmony with persona. Bringing his therapist into it adds a back-story, plus the word <i class="calibre3">‘panicked’</i> makes it even more in his voice, because his persona suggests that he easily gets into a panic. We can picture him in that situation, and that routine coming to life is a perfect example of why having a defined persona is so important.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Just like a character in a sitcom saying something funny because it shows their unique perspective on a certain situation, a comedian’s material is only truly funny coming from the right person. Most people understand that when it comes to sitcoms and yet so many comedians fail to see its importance in stand-up. If you think of your favourite scene in any sitcom and swap the main characters’ lines with each other’s, the comedy not only becomes weaker, it can often fail to exist.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Look how this routine started off:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Given that vaping isn’t illegal in pubs, why do people ask permission to do it?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is classic birthing, and the entire process only took around fifteen minutes. If you do this kind of thing for two hours a day, you’ll not only find material that does suit your persona, you’ll start to fully understand your persona. Those are two hugely beneficial things that will happen at the same time, and they won’t happen if you just absorb this chapter; you have to do it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’m not finished with the bus stop joke. I’m going to go back over that list again and try to write a joke about smoking that suits the persona of the comedian I set out to write for.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I quite like the idea of elaborating on this observation:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Smokers say that, if you light a cigarette at a bus stop, a bus always comes’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">How about:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘The other day, I was waiting ages for a bus. You know how smokers say that if you light a cigarette at a bus stop, a bus will turn up? I started wondering if the same applies to vaping. Anyway, it turns out that it doesn’t…and now I’m addicted to nicotine’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I just tried it out on my brother-in-law and he laughed at the end, but didn’t so much as smile in response to the line <i class="calibre3">‘it turns out that it doesn’t’</i> and, looking back, it wasn’t that funny. However, he did suspend his disbelief that you could become addicted to nicotine having only vaped for a few minutes. Since the only part of the joke that was relevant to vaping didn’t work, I’m going to replace the word <i class="calibre3">‘vaping’</i> with <i class="calibre3">‘smoking’</i> and try to expand on it (new line underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘The other day, I was waiting ages for a bus. You know how smokers say that if you light up a cigarette at a bus stop, a bus will always turn up? Well, I tried it, and it turns out it doesn’t…not even the </i>twentieth<i class="calibre3"> time. And now I’m addicted to nicotine. <span class="underline">Plus, when I popped to the shop to buy them, I missed the bus</span>’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now we’re getting somewhere. Since the comedian is supposed to have just taken up smoking, it has to be a full pack of cigarettes that she runs out of, which is why I chose twenty. So, what’s improved?</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Smoking twenty cigarettes in a row is a funnier image than vaping non-stop</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Smoking twenty cigarettes in a row makes it even easier for an audience to suspend their disbelief that someone could get addicted to nicotine doing it</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">The next stage is to delete any redundant words. Although, in this situation, the word <i class="calibre3">‘bus’</i> is impossible to avoid saying more than once, I can get rid of one of them by trimming down the set-up (deleted words underlined and in brackets)<i class="calibre3">:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">C &ndash;  ‘The other day, I was waiting ages for a bus. You know (<span class="underline">how</span>) smokers say (<span class="underline">that</span>) if you light up a cigarette (<span class="underline">at a bus stop</span>), a bus will (<span class="underline">always</span>) turn up? Well, I tried it, and it turns out it doesn’t…not even the </i>twentieth<i class="calibre3"> time. And now I’m addicted to nicotine. Plus, when I popped to the shop to buy them, I missed the bus’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Three of these four changes are probably obvious, but failing to take out the words <i class="calibre3">‘at a bus stop’</i> is a very common mistake when it comes to getting rid of redundant words. Since the joke appears to rely on the phrase<i class="calibre3"> ‘light up a cigarette at a bus stop’</i>, it’s natural to assume that those exact words need to be said. However, they don’t, because bus stops have already been alluded to with the words <i class="calibre3">‘waiting ages for a bus’</i>. So, any audience hearing ‘C’ will have all the necessary information to understand what the comedian is talking about.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I suggest you look over some of your material to see if you fail to do this, because redundant words waste time (time you could use to be funny or more descriptive). Not only that, you don’t want your audience thinking <i class="calibre3">‘Yeah, we get the point’</i> during a long set-up.</p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container2">
          <img alt="" width="600" src="images/000025.jpeg" height="305" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">So, between ‘A’ &amp; ‘C’, I’ve added a topper and deleted eight words, making this short routine noticeably denser. There’s one more method I can use to tweak this bit and I call it ‘cramming’, which is my word for adding detail to a punchline without using many extra words. Cramming is different to double punches because it involves adding a second joke, whereas a double punch is two things happening in an audience’s minds about one joke. Given that it’s funny that a non-smoker would decide to smoke an entire packet of cigarettes to make a bus come and then misses that bus as a result, let’s cram more bad luck into the line (cramming underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Plus, when I popped back to the shop to buy <span class="underline">some more</span>, I missed the bus’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">By changing the word <i class="calibre3">‘them’</i> to <i class="calibre3">‘some more’</i> the ending is even more frustrating, because a bus came when she went to the shop for the second time. This is a very relatable situation, because we’ve all taken the same risk twice having got away with something the first time, and end up kicking ourselves that we pushed our luck. Plus, not stopping at twenty cigarettes makes the situation even more absurd. So, one extra syllable has added quite a lot to the joke. This isn’t actually a great example of cramming (remember, I’m writing this chapter and the joke concurrently) because it doesn’t add an entirely new joke to the punchline, just more detail. We’ll look at the full impact of cramming shortly.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s the final version of the brand-new bit about smoking:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">D &ndash;  ‘The other day, I was waiting ages for a bus. You know smokers say if you light up a cigarette, a bus will turn up? Well, I tried it, and it turns out it doesn’t...not even the </i>twentieth<i class="calibre3"> time. And now I’m addicted to nicotine. Plus, when I popped to the shop to buy some more, I missed the bus’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">It starts with a very relatable problem (waiting ages for a bus), gets absurd very quickly which creates a nice mental image, and the final punchline has a topper that adds to the chaos.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The next stage &ndash; and don’t ever miss this out &ndash; is to do the three-question test:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">1. Does it fit their voice?</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Yes. Taking up smoking to make a bus come is silly, plus missing that bus is low status.</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">2. Could anyone have thought of it?</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Definitely the first part, but since it twists a few times, I’d say no.</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">3. Does it remind me of something I’ve heard before?</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">A bit. The idea of challenging a superstition to provoke a reaction feels slightly derivative.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, that’s two out of three, but only because I was being hard on myself with ‘3’. This routine took fifteen minutes to write. I could have done this twenty times until I had a great routine, but I had no ego as I wrote it and that’s why I’m showing you the first thing I did from start to finish, because all that matters to me is that you take something from it. I want you to study the entire thought process from embryo to final product. If it helps, then that makes me very happy. There’s only one downside to all of this; now that the smoking routine has ended up here, the comedian I’m writing for won’t be able to use it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">As a new comedian, I’d often marvel at experienced comedians when one of their punchlines had a detail that somehow elevated the joke to being five times as strong. To me, it just meant that they were funnier than anyone else. However, soon after I eventually started adding an extra level of detail to punchlines, it hit me that the real difference was that they were cramming jokes into other jokes. When done well, it’s often the difference between good and great.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Before we look at a specific example of how powerful cramming can be, I need to mention a very basic formula used by comedians that I call ‘confirming’. It can be very effective if used well, but since it’s extremely easy to apply, many comedians manage to get away with doing it badly. Confirming always involves two lines back-to-back:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">Line 1:  </b>The comedian tells their audience something negative about themselves</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">Line 2</b>:  The comedian immediately confirms it to be true</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When done well and succinctly this can be very effective, provided it works in harmony with the comedian’s persona.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s an example of confirming done well by comedian Jim Tavaré. His persona is dopey, he looks permanently confused, and he gets simple things wrong:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I’ve got very bad grammar…isn’t it?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s beautiful when he delivers it &ndash; a seven-word joke that perfectly suits Jim’s persona. He tells us that he has bad grammar and then immediately confirms that. In this case, Jim is aware of his flaw. However, in the majority of cases, the comedian will inadvertently confirm the flaw, having just told us that someone else criticised them for having it. In its most basic form, this method can be tedious to watch. Since the formula is easy to apply, many comedians create contrived versions of it that also fail to work in harmony with their personas.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now we’re ready to look at this formula applied to two different jokes. ‘A’ will be done badly and ‘B’ will be done beautifully, because of the cramming adding an extra layer to it. Here’s the bad version:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘My partner says I never listen to them. Well, I </i>think<i class="calibre3"> that’s what they said’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, the negative is that the comedian never listens, and the confirmation is that they inadvertently give away that they weren’t listening. You can’t deny that it’s a joke, but it’s as basic as they come. Assuming this line is said by a comedian who hasn’t displayed anything in their persona to suggest that the line is believable coming from them (such as being selfish or vague), this is the epitome of formulaic, two-dimensional comedy because it’s a very basic use of confirming that doesn’t shine a torch anywhere near the comedian’s body.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">With that formula in mind, it’s time to look at a great example of cramming to show its full impact. This was during a scene in a TV show I saw years ago. A scruffy, lazy-looking man is sitting on a sofa, watching TV. His wife is in the kitchen and is halfway through telling him about something she’s clearly very worried about:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">WIFE: You’re not listening.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">THE HUSBAND DOESN’T EVEN LOOK AWAY FROM THE TV.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">HUSBAND (REASSURING TONE): Yes, they </i>will.</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This six word ‘joke’ is a perfect example of the incredible impact cramming can have because, in its basic form, ‘B’ is the same as ‘A’. The negative is that the wife accuses her husband of not listening and he immediately and inadvertently confirms that to be true. Both lines are classic examples of basic confirming, but there are two very significant reasons why ‘B’ is far stronger than ‘A’:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">It’s been crammed with an observation</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It suits the husband’s character to say it</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s the observation in its basic form:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">C &ndash;  ‘Have you noticed that, whenever someone tells us that they’re worried about something, we always reassure them in an insincere way?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">On its own, ‘C’ isn’t a great observation and that’s <span class="underline">exactly</span> why cramming is so powerful. The writers took a very basic confirming joke and merged it with a very basic observation to create a beautiful joke. This overloads the viewers’ brains by hitting them twice at the same time. Neither punch is that strong, but combined, they’re extremely powerful.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now imagine that, rather than the husband’s response existing, he’d gone to work the next day and said to a colleague:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">D &ndash;  ‘My wife told me I never listen to her. Well, I </i>think<i class="calibre3"> that’s what she said’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Look how ‘D’ isn’t even remotely close to being as strong as ‘B’. Even with the bonus of it suiting the husband’s character, it’s still weak because it no longer reveals ‘C’, which is what I call an ‘observation in disguise’. Hiding an observation inside another joke is infinitely more satisfying for audiences than simply making the observation, and once you start to harness cramming, you can give simple jokes a boost and make observations so much more exciting. Observations in disguise work even if your comedy isn’t observational. In fact, it adds a lovely extra texture to it, arguably making it at its strongest within a set or show that’s all about punchlines that rely on surprise.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Since that example was from a TV show, I’ll give you an example of cramming used in stand-up. One year at the Edinburgh Festival, the Pleasance (one of the major venues) had several new theatre spaces, some of which were dotted around near to their main building. These venues had various names, such as ‘Pleasance Over the Road’. I watched the brilliant comedian Bill Bailey’s show, and at one point he said, in his beautifully understated way:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘There are so many new venues this year, aren’t there? There’s Pleasance Above, Pleasance Below, Pleasance…Up to the lights and ask’. (2 / 6)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The words <i class="calibre3">‘up to the lights and ask’</i> were delivered in that helpful tone people use when they’re giving someone directions. The audience roared with laughter, as did I. By simply sticking the observation inside the name of a made-up venue, he’d created a double punch, a funny name for a venue and an observation about giving tricky directions. So, cramming is a double punch, just with two different jokes at the same time. Now let’s look at the observation on its own:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Have you noticed that, whenever you give someone tricky directions, it ends with you telling them to ask someone else for directions?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s certainly not a bad observation on its own. However, look how much more effective it is when hidden inside another joke. This is partly because comedy is far more rewarding when we have to do some of the work ourselves, and partly because being given two simple tasks at once is enough to cause a brain overload, and that’s exciting. If you can make an observation in disguise every five minutes, having shaved off a few words from every other line and are conducting tension before adding misdirection to create a double punch, it’ll feel like your wings have got wings.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">In a few minutes, I want you to make a list of things that spring to mind when you think of a topic. If that list doesn’t provoke a thought, make another list. If that doesn’t work, change the topic and start again. From my perspective, the ultimate end product is you are eventually applying my methods without having to consciously think about them. I want you to soon find yourself shuffling sentences as instinctively as putting the clutch down in a manual car. Apologies if you can only drive an automatic.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s time for you to go away and type out and then tweak a brand-new bit of material. Remember to start with a list. If it works first time, that’s amazing. If not, start again and either add to that list or change the topic and write a new list. If you don’t do it now, make a note to do it soon.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">We’re all different, but when I’ve seen this method work for other people, it has helped them as much as double their turnover. I want you to pick a topic and make a list of things that spring to mind, and write about the ones that inspire you. If this method works well for you, you might have found a new superpower. At very least, when you do the three-question test, you’ll be reminding yourself what material suits or doesn’t suit your persona, and that in itself is a vital exercise in growth. If someone who hasn’t yet got a defined persona approaches me to tweak their existing material, I always make an excuse not to work with them in a tactful way that doesn’t involve hurting their feelings. This is simply because, if there’s no tree, I can’t create any leaves. Creating a persona requires a whole new skillset, and generally involves that comedian doing a lot of gigging and tweaking.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I want you to promise yourself that you’ll write out that list of thoughts on a topic within twenty-four hours, and apply some or all of the methods we’ve discussed. I know we didn’t ‘discuss’ anything, but I’m picturing you reading my thoughts as I write them down. Plus, I’ve spent a lot of time listening to what you might be thinking. Don’t make excuses such as you work long hours, or it isn’t a real deadline. Do it just before you go to bed or during your breaks at work. It’s your responsibility to find the time. Once you’ve trained your brain to apply these methods, it will start to write jokes, or structure existing routines or stories, without you even trying to do it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Imagine having a machine on you at all times that can create a punchline whenever you want one. They won’t always be strong, and I’m more than happy to admit that I’ve proven that. However, I’ve trained my brain to be able to think like any comedian who has a definable persona and, after eight hours of hard work, I’ll have produced six to ten minutes of brand-new material that’s in their voice. Of that material, four to five minutes of it will get tried out onstage, and two to three minutes of it will end up as material.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’ve watched some of the best comedians in the world doing brand-new material to complete silence and thought <i class="calibre3">‘How did you ever think that bit was going to work?’</i> They’d taken a risk, and their audience told them that they’d failed. They’ll then either tweak that bit or drop it, and then keep writing. Being both original and successful is, in my opinion, the ultimate situation you can be in as a comedian (or any artist), and that has to involve taking risks. When it comes to generating new material, it’s as simple as trying it onstage and seeing what happens. Remember that, since birthing is often a result of trying new stuff onstage, it’s worth trying pretty much anything if you’re comfortable improvising around it. It’s certainly a lot easier than walking onstage with nothing, which is the live equivalent of staring at a blank screen.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Don’t forget to also write your stuff out once you’ve done it onstage a few times, and try to add toppers. These are all methods that work and, since everyone is different, it’s simply a case of finding out which ones work best for you.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now get to work, because not putting any of these methods to practice will mean that all you’ve done is as good as read half a dictionary.</p>

      <p class="first1">When I was around twelve years old, I saw a comedy sketch on TV about Vincent van Gogh being alive today, and the actor was made-up to look like he only had one ear. He held up a Sony Walkman and we could clearly see that the headphones had been snapped in half. He then said:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Do you like my new Walkman? I got it half price’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The studio audience howled with laughter (probably canned laughter), and I remember not laughing and instead thinking, <i class="calibre3">‘An entire Walkman wouldn’t be half price if you snapped the headphones in half. Plus, who’s going to buy the other half of a headphone?’</i> So, rather than it doing what some comedy does and overload my brain with thoughts that momentarily make me feel glad to be alive, all that happened was me thinking <i class="calibre3">‘Nah!’</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">However, thinking about it years later, it occurred to me that the writers might have meant that the Walkman was on sale because the headphones were already broken and, since Van Gogh only had one ear, he took full advantage of that situation. That would at least make more sense, and I’d have probably found it funny had I interpreted it that way. The key word is <i class="calibre3">‘interpreted’.</i> Assuming the writers had intended the audience to see it as Van Gogh taking advantage of the Walkman being on sale, any ambiguity could have been removed by simply saying (change underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Do you like my new Walkman? <span class="underline">It was on sale</span>…half price’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">That tiny change would have made the difference between the audience hearing a really weak joke and an okay one. It was never going to be great, but that’s not the point.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I often talk about the difference between good and great. Removing ambiguity from a joke can make the difference between bad and great. Although audiences often think as one emotionally, a cerebral joke creates a maze inside each of their minds, and that maze should only have one exit. An audience’s job is to intelligently race through that maze until they find their way out, but it’s your job to make sure there’s only one exit. If there are two exits in a maze and some of your audience come out of the wrong one, they haven’t failed, <span class="underline">you</span> have. This is a very important thing to understand. I’ve lost count of the amount of comedians who behave triumphantly when they announce that they’ve written a joke that can be misinterpreted, and that only the elite deserve to be rewarded for getting it. This is an awful attitude, and is very different to planting extra details for your audience to discover. There’s a huge difference between a joke with extra layers and an unclear joke. If audience members regularly find themselves leaving the wrong exit of a maze, it’s a badly designed maze.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">An ambiguous punchline is like that moment when a friend is telling you a story that involves two other people and, later on in the story, they refer to both people in that story as <i class="calibre3">‘she’.</i> Your friend will say something like <i class="calibre3">‘And then she said…’</i> and you instantly get confused. They know which <i class="calibre3">‘she’</i> they’re picturing in their mind’s eye at that moment, but you can’t possibly know. So, there’s a fifty percent chance that you’re not going to understand the story, and it certainly isn’t your fault if you get it wrong.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The most cerebral punchline that ever existed might take the most intelligent person in the world a full second to get, but it should still only have one exit. This not only makes the joke much easier to get, it also makes it harder to <span class="underline">not</span> get. So, don’t blame your audience for what might well be lazy writing. I haven’t ever heard a brilliant comedian talking about how several audiences didn’t get a new joke of theirs, because their outlook on the situation will always involve putting themselves in the minds of their audience and rewording that joke.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s an example of me failing to only have one exit in a maze. A few years ago, I came up with a routine about pornography. This is a topic that’s done to death, but I’ve always believed that a strong joke about a very common topic is far better than a weak joke about a topic that no one covers. This is another common misconception amongst comedians. It’s the originality of the thought behind a joke that makes a joke original, not the subject matter alone. There are clichéd perspectives, but a subject alone cannot be a cliché. You could even argue that finding an original joke about a common topic is even more of an achievement, since so many comedians have covered that topic and yet none of them had the specific idea that you came up with.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Anyway, here’s the opening line to the routine:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘I don’t watch pornography; I think it objectifies women. Then again, it also humanises objects’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s succinct, feels like an original perspective and the words <i class="calibre3">‘objectifies women’ </i>and<i class="calibre3"> ‘humanises objects’</i> bounce back and forth nicely (we’ll look closer at that detail later). There’s no pause, so it doesn’t need a seesaw. However, there was one big problem that I hadn’t spotted. Although the line sometimes really worked, it would often be greeted with a mixture of silence and the judgmental <i class="calibre3">‘Oohs!’</i> despite it actually starting with what was arguably a feminist statement. I could only put it down to word bingo because the words <i class="calibre3">‘objectifies women’</i> triggered some of my audience because the bingo word was in the set-up and not the punchline (I had no choice in this case).</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Anyway, here’s the problem. To me, the joke was that a computer is an object, but when you show an image of people on its screen, that screen becomes humanised. It’s cerebral, original and there doesn’t appear to be a victim. So, why wasn’t it working? One night, a friend mentioned liking my <i class="calibre3">‘joke about the cucumber’</i>. I had absolutely no idea what they were referring to. It turned out that their interpretation of the joke was that pornography humanised the objects being used in the films. I’d been doing that line for months before I realised it was ambiguous. The maze had two exits with two completely different outcomes and, when I wrote it, I had absolutely no idea that would be the case. So, I’d failed.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">This not only explained why it often received mixed reactions, it also explained why some audience members responded negatively to a line that didn’t reveal a single negative opinion. They’d got stuck in the maze, panicked and reacted with <i class="calibre3">‘Ooh!’</i> because, although they didn’t quite know what had happened, they did know that I’d just brushed upon a controversial topic, so they felt their best option was to take the moral high ground. Yes, I’m confident that that’s exactly what happened. It’s a defence mechanism. They’re basically applying the <i class="calibre3">‘shoot first, ask questions later’</i> approach.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Look at the mess that a two-line joke containing a combination of word bingo in the set-up and a double-exit maze in the punchline has the potential to create. I was spinning a wheel every time I performed that joke.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Given that I’m preaching seeing yourself as being like a sniper on a roof, I obviously can’t have a joke with two very different interpretations and a third option that results in confusion. That’s clearly not a good situation. So, to fix this joke, I had to close off one exit of the maze by removing one of the two interpretations. I thought I might as well do this with both versions one at a time. So, let’s start by tweaking the original version by closing off the wrong exit of the maze (new words underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘I don’t watch pornography; I think it objectifies women. Then again, <span class="underline">given that you start off with a blank screen</span>, it also humanises objects’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although the new detail removes any chance of people thinking about objects other than a screen, it’s a lot more wordy and still slightly unclear. So, I’m not feeling the joke at all.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s try to make the second interpretation clearer by instead closing off the <span class="underline">other</span> exit of the maze (change underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">C &ndash;  ‘I don’t watch pornography; I think it objectifies women. Then again, <span class="underline">when you watch it</span>, it also humanises objects’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is so much clearer than the original version because it forces the audience to imagine themselves watching a film as opposed to hearing me mentioning the topic. It’s got four extra syllables, but still flows nicely.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, I had three versions to choose from:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">A:</b>  A double-exit maze potentially ending in confusion</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">B:</b>  A wordy punchline with one slightly cryptic ending</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">C:</b>  A succinct punchline with one clear ending</p>
      <p class="subsq1">‘A’ obviously isn’t an option and ‘B’ was tempting since it’s what I set out to achieve. However, ‘C’ is easily my favourite of the three versions. It’s clearer, punchier and, although it creates a potentially crude mental image, no objects are ever mentioned. So, I’d rewritten a messy joke and, purely by fluke, ended up with a completely new one. That joke was a frog who’d finally been given the medicine it needed. Admittedly, it was the vet who’d made it sick in the first place.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I performed ‘C’ and the success rate immediately shot up and the problem was finally solved. This can only be achieved by putting yourself in the minds of your audience rather than blaming them.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Look at all the thoughts and choices that came from this one sentence. Had my friend not brought it up, I would’ve no doubt continued to make false assumptions as to why it wasn’t landing every time. I wonder how many hundreds of thousands of double-exit mazes have resulted in comedians blaming their audience whenever a punchline didn’t get the reaction they felt it deserved.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now I want you to go over some or even all of your cerebral and subtle material and look out for double-exit mazes. It’s unlikely that there won’t be a single one out there. Once you start to train your brain to look for them, you’ll have a much better chance of ending up with the clearest wording of a punchline the first time you perform it. Yes, I failed that time. However, I often find myself bouncing several versions of a double-exit maze around inside my head until there’s only one exit.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Often, I’ll watch a comedian hit a slightly ambiguous punchline and I’ll get the weaker ending first. By the time I’ve realised the funny idea they’d intended me to get, the moment has gone. This kind of thing is what causes comedians to come offstage and say something like <i class="calibre3">‘They didn’t get my new joke’. </i>It very rarely occurs to that comedian that the problem was their joke.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There are all sorts of reasons why a line doesn’t work on any given night that are out of our control. So, it’s very dangerous to blame an audience whenever something doesn’t work. I’ll occasionally hear a comedian say, <i class="calibre3">‘That audience wasn’t very intelligent’.</i> Although it’s possible to find yourself in front of audiences made up of slightly brighter people than certain other audiences due to the demographic, what the comedian is very often doing in this situation is protecting their ego.</p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container2">
          <img alt="" width="600" src="images/000026.jpeg" height="542" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">So, rather than wondering what they could’ve done differently to allow their material to connect with that audience, they go home convincing themselves that the reason they didn’t do well was because their material is too clever. This is very likely to be delusional on the comedian’s part.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Assuming your audience can hear you clearly and aren’t drunk or thinking in a second language, here are a few reasons why a punchline might not have gone down well that comedians should consider before putting the blame on their audience:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">A double-exit maze</li>
        <li class="calibre6">A punchline with too much information in it</li>
        <li class="calibre6">A word, phrase or cultural reference not known to the majority of that audience</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The audience didn’t commit to more cerebral jokes because they hadn’t warmed to the comedian</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">The last one on that list is often a self-fulfilling prophecy. If a comedian decides that their audience isn’t very intelligent before they’ve even got onstage, they’ll often give off an air of superiority from the moment they walk onstage. Then, when a cerebral line doesn’t work because the audience isn’t fully engaged, due to having not warmed to them, they’ll come off thinking <i class="calibre3">‘I knew my stuff was too clever for them’.</i> They might even go home feeling superior to the comedians who did well on the same bill. This is a potentially catastrophic approach.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Not everyone is intelligent, but what are the chances of 300 stupid people all choosing to part with money to be entertained in the same venue on the same evening and all happening to fail to get the same one joke? Also, wouldn’t it be quite a coincidence that the previous time that same punchline worked happened to be 300 intelligent people in the same room?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Do you remember this sentence?</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Just like a flock of birds flying in formation, if an audience is big enough and everyone is sitting close enough to each other, they start to think as one’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Why not see yourself as the bird at the front? Either way, I’d say that, when you look at that list of four things that could have caused material to fail, it’s very possible that the problem was something that the comedian did wrong. The most significant difference between demographics isn’t intelligence, it’s their opinions on a comedian’s opinions (e.g. politics). There are also audiences who are less ‘comedy literate’ than others, but that doesn’t mean that they won’t appreciate original comedy. They’ll just be more likely to <span class="underline">also</span> appreciate less original comedy. So, rather than sitting at the back of a room judging an audience for laughing at something you don’t find funny, focus on getting that audience into what you do. If they’ve paid to laugh and they’re laughing at someone they’ve just warmed to, who are we to decide what their average IQ is? Time spent judging audiences is time you could be spending closing off second exits to mazes.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">A few minutes ago, I mentioned an audience not getting a cultural reference. When I was very new to comedy and doing open mic spots, I watched a comedian do a five-minute gig to almost complete silence. They came off slightly shaken and said:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">“I don’t think that audience was very intelligent”.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I politely asked them why, and they explained that they didn’t feel that enough of the audience had read the novel they’d referred to in one of their routines. This is obviously another classic example of the ego protecting itself, but let’s look at the effects of cultural references in comedy. First of all, intelligence is the ability to think, and it’s ridiculous to judge the capacity of someone’s brain purely on the back of a cultural reference. Far more importantly, isn’t it a huge risk to rely on a roomful of people to have read one specific book for a routine to have any chance of working? If you’ve got a new bit about a major news story, classic film or major celebrity and it requires your audience to get the reference, then of course it’s okay to take the small risk that not every single person will understand the entire routine, but clearly not when it comes to a book that only serves to leave you feeling superior to ninety percent of the audience just because they haven’t read it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">However, if handled skilfully, taking a risk that only some of your audience will get a reference can create something very magical for the people who get it, as long as it doesn’t end up ruining the ending or even the entire routine for everyone else. This is a beautiful detail, but fiddly to explain, so please stay with me. Earlier, I wrote this sentence:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I grew up reading Dr. Seuss books and I’m here to keep his spirit alive, and that doesn’t mean running over a fox in socks’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s probably a twenty-five percent chance you knew exactly what I meant. If you didn’t, <i class="calibre3">Fox in Socks</i> is the title of a Dr. Seuss book. Now let’s imagine I said it as a throwaway line within a routine onstage, having previously explained who Dr. Seuss was. What would happen in my audience’s minds when I said the line about a fox in socks?</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Of the seventy-five percent of my audience who didn’t get the reference, it’s likely that they’ll be able to work out that ‘<i class="calibre3">fox in socks’</i> must be a reference to a Dr. Seuss quote (did that happen to you?). They won’t laugh, but they’ll at <span class="underline">least</span> have some idea what’s going on</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The twenty-five percent of my audience who <span class="underline">did</span> get the reference will get a cosy feeling knowing that I’ve reached out to them</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">By subtly referring to the title of a children’s book, I’ve as good as said to twenty-five percent of the room:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Did your parents read that book to you, too?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">When you’re in an audience and you get a reference like that, that moment can feel very magical (I did it earlier with the <i class="calibre3">‘big mistake’</i> line from the film <i class="calibre3">Pretty Woman</i>). When done well, it can even feel like that moment was created just for you. However, it’s very important to be aware of what goes on in the minds of the rest of your audience when that happens. Here are a few things to consider when making a reference that less than the majority of an audience will understand:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">A:</b>  It’s an extremely bad idea to make that reference on the final punchline of a routine</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">B:</b>  You won’t completely alienate anyone if there’s at least some information that everyone will understand (e.g. mentioning Dr. Seuss)</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">C:</b>  You allude to the reference with a wink, nod, raised eyebrow or subtle glance immediately after the punchline that contains the reference</p>
      <p class="subsq1">What’s very economical about ‘C’ is that it achieves two things. For the audience members who got the reference, it will make that cosy feeling even cosier and, for everyone else, it lets them know they haven’t just failed to get a joke, just that you’ve made a reference that’s not for everyone. It’s never ideal to not get a joke, but that ‘wink’ prevents the people who didn’t laugh from feeling completely excluded.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">None of this can be achieved if you ignore ‘A’ and make a cultural reference on the final punchline of a routine. Doing that is destined to alienate some of your audience in a way that gives them a bad experience, as well as take all the charm out of a potentially magical moment. I realise that explaining that method might’ve been slightly less clear than any of the previous things I’ve explained so far, and I’m sorry if that’s been the case.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">However, if any part of that last section didn’t make sense, I’d say there’s one book that you simply must read. It’s called <i class="calibre3">Finding Your Comic Genius</i>. Skip to Chapter 20.</p>

      <p class="first1">I’ve acknowledged that there are exceptions to every rule. However, I’m about to make a bold claim which won’t fully make sense, but I’ll explain myself soon:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">If two identical key words are in a punchline and one of them is the final word of that punchline, unless it’s bookended, it will <span class="underline">not</span> land well.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Before we look at bookending, let’s look at the effects of carelessly repeating key words at the end of a punchline. Since all punchlines create surprise in one form or another, that surprise simply isn’t effective if the final word has previously been said within a few seconds of you ending a punchline on it. Look at these two sentences from the chapter on creating new material:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I want you to soon find yourself shuffling sentences as instinctively as putting the clutch down in a manual car. Apologies if you can only drive an automatic’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The last sentence was tweaked because the first version I wrote sounded wrong. Here’s the original one <span class="underline">before</span> I tweaked it (repeated word underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I want you to soon find yourself shuffling sentences as instinctively as putting the clutch down in a <span class="underline">manual</span> car. Apologies if you can’t drive a <span class="underline">manual</span>’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Just after I wrote this, a voice in my head told me that something wasn’t right. So, I tweaked it. It was a classic case of avoiding repetition. As light a joke as it may be, it still deserves to not have repetition of the word ‘<i class="calibre3">manual</i>’ as the final word of the sentence, especially given how close it is to the previous time I say the same word. We’ll look at the importance of that in a minute. Also, <i class="calibre3">‘automatic’</i> is a much punchier word than <i class="calibre3">‘manual’ </i>to end a sentence on. However, the bigger problem of the two by far is the sloppy repetition of the word <i class="calibre3">‘manual’</i>.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s one very significant exception when it comes to saying a key word twice (and you might be ahead of me) and that’s a method that I call ‘bookending’. This happens when the repeated word is at either end of the second half of a punchline, and those two words are quite far apart. To demonstrate just how effective bookending can be, I’m going to write a deliberately weak joke that will still land well, purely because it’s perfectly bookended:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘Throughout my entire childhood, I wanted a pet. When I finally got a dog, there was only one thought that went through my mind and that’s…“I wish I hadn’t got a dog”’. </i>(13 / 8)</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Notice how the punchline lands even though I said the word <i class="calibre3">‘dog’ </i>twice in the same sentence. That’s bookending. Not only is it barely a joke, it doesn’t have a seesaw and yet, despite all of that, the fact that it’s bookended still manages to give it punch. Also notice that I said <i class="calibre3">‘pet’</i> in the set-up. This was so I wouldn’t say the word <i class="calibre3">‘dog’</i> more than twice.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I worked out that, for a punchline to be perfectly bookended, there are four things that need to happen:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">The repeated key words must be identical</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The second identical key word must be the final word of the punchline</li>
        <li class="calibre6">There must be several words between the identical key words</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The first of the two identical key words must happen <span class="underline">immediately</span> before a pause</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">The reason it’s important to have several words between the identical key words is to give your audience enough time to almost forget the word<i class="calibre3">.</i> So, when they hear it a second time, it’s like a mini-callback.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The best way to know if you’ve successfully bookended a punchline is to say it out loud to make sure it lands well. However, if it doesn’t, that check list should be very helpful. The first two things on that list are quite obvious to spot and possibly even the third, but discovering the fourth was a revelation.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Listen to what happens to this joke if I add three syllables between the repeated word and the pause (extra syllables underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘When I finally got a dog <span class="underline">for Christmas</span>, there was only </i>one<i class="calibre3"> thought that went through my mind and that’s…“I wish I hadn’t got a dog”’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Notice that this new rhythm completely fails. It would even fail if there was just one syllable between the first time I say <i class="calibre3">‘dog’</i> and the pause. Just like it did with seesaws, this felt like quite a discovery.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Very occasionally, I’ll see a comedian fail to create perfect bookending and the punchline will still sound pleasant. However, they certainly don’t land as well as they could have done.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">You might be thinking <i class="calibre3">‘Is comedy really all about maths?’</i> No. In this case it’s about music, and I’ve just worked out one of the chords. There are definitely elements of maths and science within comedy but actually <span class="underline">being</span> funny is a gift, and if comedy was only about maths and science all clever people would be able to do it, and they can’t.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I sometimes find myself watching a highly educated newer comedian attempting stand-up and failing to have good gigs. Sometimes, I even see them backstage with a look on their face that seems to say, <i class="calibre3">‘Law school was a doddle; why couldn’t I make these people laugh?’</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">One of my many goals is to show you that patterns do exist, and why it’s very useful to understand them.<b class="calibre4"> </b>What you do with those patterns is down to your talent and hard work.</p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container">
          <img alt="" width="450" src="images/000027.jpeg" height="355" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look at another, weaker version of the same punchline:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">C &ndash;  ‘When I finally got a dog…I wished I hadn’t got a dog’.</i></b> <b class="calibre4">(8 / 8)</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is an awful punchline. Not only is there a pause bang slap in the middle, the repeated words are very close together (they’re only separated by six words).</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Before we go back to talking about bookending, there’s another major difference between ‘A’ &amp; ‘C’: only ‘A’ has anticipation. Look what happens during the pause:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘When I finally got a dog, there was only </i>one<i class="calibre3"> thought that went through my mind, and that’s…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">That pause forces the audience to wonder what that <i class="calibre3">‘one thought’</i> was. Without that pause, the audience doesn’t have time to think anything. Now let’s look at ‘C’ again:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">C &ndash;  ‘When I finally got a dog…I wished I hadn’t got a dog’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Not only does the bookending completely fail because the repeated words are so close together, it creates zero anticipation. We’ll talk a lot more about anticipation later (yes, I’m going to make you wait). Now let’s look at the sentence from the previous chapter that I changed because it didn’t sound right. Can you see the two reasons why this fails as a bookended punchline?</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘…as instinctive as putting the clutch down in a manual car. Apologies if you can’t drive a manual’.</i></b></p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6"><i class="calibre3">‘Manual car’ </i>and <i class="calibre3">‘manual’</i> aren’t identical</li>
        <li class="calibre6">They’re too close together</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">So, no wonder an alarm bell went off in my head as soon as I wrote it. Even if I’d changed it to:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘…as instinctive as putting the clutch down in a <span class="underline">manual</span>. Apologies if you can’t drive a manual’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">…it still fails because the repeated words are only separated by six words, plus <i class="calibre3">‘manual’</i> isn’t a nice-sounding final word. I should remind you that you must always say a new line out loud to check that the rhythm works and that it lands nicely. When done properly and using a punchy final word, I’ve found that bookending is effective 100% of the time.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">You might be thinking <i class="calibre3">‘What if I create a bookended punchline and it doesn’t sound right?’ </i>If for some reason you create what looks like bookending, but it doesn't sound right, you’re probably missing out one of the four details. However, if you get stuck, simply change the first of the repeated words for another word that means the same thing. If you can’t do that, replace the second repeated word (the final word of the punchline) with an equally punchy word that means the same thing. The first of these two is easier to do, because there’s far more pressure for the final word to be punchy. Sloppy repetition of words will always result in a weak punchline. However, once you get used to bookending punchlines, you shouldn’t face this problem.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Instinctively making this kind of adjustment when I write for other people is strangely enjoyable. I’ll often open a document to see several opportunities to apply this method staring back at me. It feels like tidying up a messy bedroom.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Do you remember this deliberately messy sentence from the chapter on word smuggling?</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I believe that they will help you to improve many things and creating the perfect punchline will be one of those things’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">We already know that two things are wrong with this sentence:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">The alliteration (<i class="calibre3">‘perfect punchline’</i>) gets lost</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It ends on a weak-sounding word</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">However, can you see another thing that’s wrong with it? The final word is repeated and yet it’s not bookended, because there’s no pause after the first time I say <i class="calibre3">‘things’.</i> Instead, it happens mid-sentence and that’s another reason why it’s such an ugly sentence.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Finally, do you remember this line from earlier?</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Have you noticed that, whenever you give someone tricky directions, it ends with you telling them to ask someone else for directions?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is perfectly bookended, and I trust you can see exactly why. With all that in mind, here’s that bold claim from the beginning of this chapter that will now make perfect sense:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">If two identical key words are in a punchline and one of them is the final word of that punchline, unless it’s bookended, it will <span class="underline">not</span> land well.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I was instinctively avoiding sloppy repetition and successfully bookending punchlines for years before that list of four things occurred to me, and you might have already been doing the same. However, if you weren’t, you’ll now be able to work out why repetition on a punchline doesn’t feel right and instantly fix it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s a cousin of bookending that I  call ‘flipping’. It generally doesn’t create as hard a punch as bookending, but can be very poetic. To show you an example, I’m going to look at this punchline from the previous chapter. Look at the underlined words:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘I don’t watch pornography, I think it <span class="underline">objectifies women</span>. Then again, when you watch it, it also <span class="underline">humanises objects</span>’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although this ends on the repeated key word, it’s completely different to bookending because it’s purely about a repeated sound being either side of two short groups of words. It’s also different because it doesn’t have to be the entire word that’s repeated. In this case, we only need to repeat the hard sound <i class="calibre3">‘object’.</i> Flipping is far more gentle than bookending, but it’s rhythmic and why I often use it to make set-ups nicer, or boost a lull in a story. Let’s look at the groups of sounds:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Objectifies women…humanises objects’. (4 / 2) (4 / 2)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I got lucky this time because there is the exact same amount of syllables at both ends. Don’t worry; it doesn’t have to be that strict, I just wanted to draw your attention to the flow. However, the length of the string of words between the two groups of sounds shouldn’t be too long. Flipping is a perfect example of comedy being like music. So, what really matters is that you can hear that it works rhythmically when you say the line out loud.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">With the exception of flipping, I avoid semi-repetition on final words of set-ups and punchlines. Here’s a good example of why. Say this set-up out loud:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Someone I know spent three hours driving to their school reunion only to find out that they didn’t like anyone’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although there are no repeated words, <i class="calibre3">‘some<b class="calibre4">one</b>’ </i>and <i class="calibre3">‘any<b class="calibre4">one</b>’</i> both end in the same syllable and, since <i class="calibre3">‘anyone’</i> is the final word, it creates a problem. So, ending a sentence on a word with the same final syllable as another key word results in a weaker punch. Even though it’s not a punchline, it’s still a weak sentence and is very easy to fix. Say this new version out loud (change underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘<span class="underline">A friend of mine</span> spent three hours driving to their school reunion only to find out that they didn’t like anyone’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Notice that, by making sure that not even one syllable of the final word has been used before, it lands better. This may seem like a small detail, but ignoring it on a punchline is almost as damaging as repeating an entire word. So, unless a punchline is bookended, the entire final word of it should be a surprise.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">One thing I’ve noticed about semi-repetition is that, when it comes to two words that are back-to-back (in a set-up or punchline), similar-sounding final syllables tend to sound completely wrong:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘They’re usu<span class="underline">ally</span> extrem<span class="underline">ely</span> different’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This simply doesn’t flow well because the final syllables are too similar. I avoid this situation at all costs. However, if two identical final syllables are repeated back-to-back, a lovely thing often happens:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘They’re usu<span class="underline">ally</span> tot<span class="underline">ally</span> different’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">That subtle difference between the two is what makes ‘B’ flow beautifully.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s surprisingly easy to find the right words to make these moments happen. Checking for these kinds of moments doesn’t result in robotic delivery, it results in much smoother comedy. When a comedian clearly hasn’t considered flow in their set-ups, it’s a clear sign that they only see those words as ‘necessary information’, and that’s actually quite an insult to language. It’s pleasant when a set-up occasionally has moments like this:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">‘<i class="calibre3">Although things were the same as last year, they’re usually totally different’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">If a punchline is a snack, see moments like this as garnish. If your style is very conversational, just make sure that these moments aren’t too contrived, as you’ll risk your material coming across as too ‘written’, creating a potential boom mic moment. However, when well-placed, little bursts of pleasant sounds can spice up a lull or set-up and do wonders for a punchline.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Later on, there is an entire chapter dedicated to flow and it will hopefully prove how important and underrated nice-sounding words are.</p>

    <div class="title-page-contributor-primary-block" id="calibre_link-128">
      <p class="first1">One of the most jarring things a comedian can do is state an incorrect fact that forces some of their audience to think <i class="calibre3">‘That’s not right’.</i> It happens very often. and I’m sure that I’ve unknowingly been guilty of doing it many times. Do you remember my bit about smoking at a bus stop? There was a line I had to change. I <span class="underline">originally</span> wrote:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Well I tried it, and it turns out it doesn’t…not even the </i><span class="underline">tenth</span><i class="calibre3"> time’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">It then occurred to me that it’s been a very long time since I’ve seen someone pull out a packet of ten cigarettes. So, I Googled <i class="calibre3">‘Can you still buy packs of ten cigarettes in Britain?’ </i>and it turns out that you can’t<i class="calibre3">.</i> So, I simply changed it to <i class="calibre3">‘twentieth’. </i>Arguably that’s funnier, as it makes the joke more absurd. Either way, it can be very annoying when a comedian’s punchline is badly researched because it forces the audience out of the moment. However, what happens if you can’t adjust the flaw in a joke without ruining it? When this happens, it requires a method that I call ‘lemoning’. This involves making a second joke about the fact that there’s a flaw in the first joke. This ‘<i class="calibre3">when life gives you lemons, make lemonade’</i> approach results in expanding a routine, rather than dropping it or hoping that no one notices the flaw in it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s a huge difference between an audience suspending their disbelief when they listen to a fantastical story and them knowing that a fact is incorrect. I’ve had so many non-comedian friends turn to me on the way home from a gig and say something like:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘That first comedian’s joke about tenpin bowling doesn’t make sense because, when you get a strike, you don’t get a second shot’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">In this situation, a high percentage of the people in the audience will have that exact thought and, when that happens, it forces them out of the moment and you don’t want that to ever happen, especially during a story. Even if that game of tenpin bowling takes place on the Moon, people will still have that thought because it doesn’t matter how fantastical a story is, there’s a massive difference between an audience suspending their disbelief and them ignoring the rules of a game. They’re two completely different things.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">A good example of lemoning would be to tag the line that doesn’t make sense with:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘By the way, I </i>am<i class="calibre3"> aware that you’re not supposed to get a second shot after a strike, but just like when you’re playing pool, the rules to bowling vary slightly depending on where you are in the universe’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Lemoning is equivalent to an actor pushing the boom mic back off-camera and can be very charming as long as it suits your persona to do it, which is a question only you can answer. Asking yourself that question is a good exercise in getting to know your persona. Lemoning is also very similar to giving your audience a wink just after making an obscure cultural reference.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I once saw Rich Hall on <i class="calibre3">8 out of 10 Cats Does Countdown</i> (it’s on YouTube). He sang a song, and the premise was that he could tell that his partner was cheating on him because of the clues she kept giving him with the words she put down during a game of Scrabble. So, to write this song, he had to find anagrams of several romantic words. For example, instead of choosing ‘<i class="calibre3">heart’</i> she chose <i class="calibre3">‘hater’.</i> Every single word she put down was negative when they could have been loving. Later on, he sang:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘You could have spelled “love”, but you chose “E...V…O…L”,</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">Who the f#@k taught you to spell?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, rather than accepting that there was no negative word that was an anagram of <i class="calibre3">‘love’</i>, Rich found an imperfect spelling of <i class="calibre3">‘evil’</i> and then topped it with a killer line about his partner’s bad spelling. That’s classic lemoning. In fact, if you watch that clip, that line is also one of the best examples of a comedian only swearing once that I can possibly think of. We’ll talk about this subject a lot more in the chapter on swearing. I suggest that you not only watch that clip now, but also have it cued up to watch again later on.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">In the same way that you might be able to resurrect a few cubes because they just need to be hit by a ball, you might also have some other great lines in the bin that just need to be hit by a lemon.</p>

      <p class="first1">It’s time for you to take a break from reading (and please do this). If you’re prepared to fully commit to growing as a comedian it must involve throwing yourself into your work. I’d like you to live and breathe comedy. However, if that doesn’t suit your lifestyle or personality, at least give more of yourself than usual. I want you to go over every bit of material you have and apply the torch test. If you have hours of material, just choose the stuff you perform most often. If you truly believe that a line, routine or even entire story isn’t you, either fix it or drop it. Fixing a bit might involve changing your status or putting unrealistic situations into hypotheses. Either make your material work for your voice or drop it. Drop any lines that don’t say anything about who you are, and even do damage to your audience’s impression of you.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When I did my first solo show at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, I’d only been doing stand-up for two and a half years. During the run-up to that month I was doing preview shows in London, and was ten minutes short of having the full hour of material needed. It was a pressure I wasn’t used to experiencing, but I still dropped one of my longest and most original routines because I knew my style had changed since I wrote it and therefore it would subtly do more harm than good to an audience’s overall impression of me. It was painful to drop material at a time when I was desperate to come up with new material.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, if I can do that while feeling the weight of the world on my shoulders, you can certainly do it &ndash; if you’ve got enough back-up material that suits you to replace it with. If you don’t have any spare material, that’s fine. Just start writing new stuff in your voice and swap the old for the new, one line or routine at a time, over the next month or two until you eventually have a set that’s all ‘you’. If you continue to perform lots of material that doesn’t suit your persona purely because it works, you will fail to improve. It really is that simple, so see the bigger picture and make that leap.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, here’s your homework to do at the end of this chapter, and it will be extremely rewarding when you do it. I want you to type out lots (or at least some) of your existing material word-for-word, hopefully adding toppers as you go. I truly hope this works for you, because it turned out to be some of the easiest writing I’ve ever done. The economical thing about doing this is, if nothing happens, you’ve just written out what you need for your next stage of homework. Regardless of what happens when you type it all out, take a short break at the end to clear your mind, and then go back and apply all of the following methods that apply to your comedy:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">First apply the torch test and then tweak any necessary material (including rearranging your status)</li>
        <li class="calibre6">If a bit of material feels out of character no matter how much you tweak it, <span class="underline">drop</span> it</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Find an existing joke to use as an opening line that sums up your persona (tweak it if necessary)</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Smuggle some words to declutter punchlines</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Create some seesaws</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Allow punchlines to end on the key word (if it suits your style)</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Shave off unnecessary words</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Remove any repeated key words on punchlines <span class="underline">unless</span> they’re bookended</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Conduct any tension to create rolling energy / bigger balloon pops</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Remove any boom mic moments (if it suits your style)</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Look out for double-exit mazes and close off the appropriate exit</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s one more thing to do and it’s the only thing on this list that doesn’t involve writing:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Tweak your stage outfit (no matter how subtle) in a way that tells your audience something about your persona</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">I want you to pause to absorb all the things that can happen or not happen within a couple of minutes onstage. Although audiences aren’t aware that many of those things exist, they certainly know that they enjoyed the comedian who was applying them and that they didn’t enjoy the one who wasn’t. This is why I’ve not yet heard a great comedian say <i class="calibre3">‘Don</i>’<i class="calibre3">t think too much about comedy’</i> because they all have done. It’s glaringly obvious when you know what to look for.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When I watch an okay comedian I’ll often laugh, but I tend to get distracted by missing seesaws and early balloon pops. When I watch a world-class comedian, I’m just watching a comedian. It just takes a world-class comedian to fully turn me into an audience member. I recently watched Harry Hill do a two-hour show. There were no early balloon pops, no lazy final words on punchlines and, despite a lot of his material being cerebral, there wasn’t a double-exit maze in sight. As a result, I regressed to being five-year-old me hearing my first joke.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Going back to you focusing on all the things on that list before applying them to your material, I suggest taking a break every two hours, and even changing your scenery now and again. Sit and write in your favourite café or on a park bench for a few hours and then return home, take a break and then carry on working. I’ve found that changing your surroundings can stimulate your brain enough to kickstart its creative side. That’s a lot of tweaking, and there are still eight more chapters left.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Assuming you’re not already applying all of these methods, imagine the difference you could potentially make to your comedy if you just focused on a handful of them. I want my advice to be practical, and it certainly isn’t realistic for you to suddenly drop five bits of material and replace them with five brand-new bits; I just want you to fully realise that consistency and originality in your material are so much more important than just having stuff that works, but leaves the audience not remembering you the next day. With the right work ethic, what may seem like a few subtle changes can actually make a profound difference.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">Assuming you’re not doing it already, you’ll soon be applying all of the methods on that list that apply to your style of comedy and won’t be able to avoid spotting it when other comedians aren’t bothering to use them.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">To give you an idea of how that will feel, look how much you know about this punchline:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I thought, “Do you know the only time I don’t see colour? When an American person writes the word…</i>color”<i class="calibre3">’.</i></b> <b class="calibre4">(11 / 2)</b></p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">It’s a cube, so needs to follow rolling energy</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The words <i class="calibre3">‘I thought’ </i>prevent it from sounding boastful</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It has a seesaw (albeit a long one)</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The balloon pops on the final word</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It ends on a nice sound</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It’s bookended</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">With all that in mind, imagine a comedian saying this version during a lull in their gig:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I said to him, “Do you know the only time I don’t see colour? When an</i> American<i class="calibre3"> person writes the word color in a text message”’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now imagine that comedian coming backstage and saying that the audience wasn’t very intelligent.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now, get to work.</p>

    <div class="title-page-contributor-primary-block" id="calibre_link-132">
      <p class="first1">I’m so grateful to my mum for teaching me to read using Dr. Seuss books, because they taught me something that I believe, to a comedian, is as valuable as being able to structure a joke, and that’s that a collection of funny or nice-sounding words can be just as beautiful as the mental image they create. Although we’ve already brushed on flow quite a bit, it really is something that has the potential to be considered during every moment that a comedian is talking, and yet so many comedians overlook it as a major part of what makes a punchline perfect.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’m a huge fan of hip-hop, it’s been a passion of mine ever since I discovered Run DMC when I was thirteen years old. No matter how ingenious a rapper’s lyrics are, if you watch them being interviewed about their favourite rappers, they will inevitably mention flow. I believe that flow in comedy, especially on a punchline, is often as important as the joke itself. We’ve seen that comedy can be like music, and yet many full-time comedians seem to forget that flow even exists. You’ll hear them standing at the back of a venue whispering things like <i class="calibre3">‘Lovely line’</i>,<i class="calibre3"> ‘Great story’ </i>or<i class="calibre3"> ‘Beautiful act-out’</i> and yet I’ve only once heard a comedian say, <i class="calibre3">‘Nice flow’</i>. It’s no coincidence that that comedian was into hip-hop.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Since I speak very fast onstage, I often find myself having to reword jokes to make the sound where two words meet easier for me to say. However, even if a comedian speaks slowly, shouldn’t those words still sound pleasant? Putting any two words together gives you the opportunity to create a new sound, and your choice of those two exact words can add poetry and even comedy to your comedy.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Before we look at the beauty that flow can create, let’s briefly look at the damage that a lack of it can do. When I was seventeen years old, I was walking down King’s Road in Chelsea. There was heavy traffic and a car pulled out to turn around in the road and got stuck, blocking the entire road. A man in a white van rolled down his window, looked over at the driver who’d blocked the road and sarcastically shouted:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">“That was clever, wasn’t it? Doughnut head!”</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I chuckled to myself and haven’t ever forgotten it. I didn’t laugh because I imagined a human with a doughnut for a head. I laughed because the words he chose to express his utter contempt for that driver had such awful flow. I realise that those were just the words that popped into his head and, in his defence, he more than got his point across. Purely as an exercise in flow, let’s look at why the sounds <i class="calibre3">‘doughnut head’</i> jarred inside my head that day. Look at where these two words join (underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">Doughn<span class="underline">ut he</span>ad!</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The sound where <i class="calibre3">‘ut’ </i>and <i class="calibre3">‘he’</i> meet is what makes the two words difficult to say back-to-back. If only he’d said:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">“You doughnut!”</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">A more extreme example would be words back-to-back ending and beginning with <i class="calibre3">‘th’</i> because it’s a very difficult sound to make and there are a lot of them out there. Regardless of how slowly you talk, unless you want to accentuate a lisp, I would strongly suggest that you avoid saying something like:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I must tell you my ba<span class="underline">th th</span>eory’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although it’s the same sound repeated, it’s a long sound that ends differently to how it starts. So, <i class="calibre3">‘th’ </i>and<i class="calibre3"> ‘th’</i> really don’t join well. You can get around this by either changing one of the words, or changing the order of the words:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I must tell you my bathtub theory’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">or:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I’ve got a theory about my bath’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Not only should you be aware of any sounds that throw a spanner into the middle of a sentence, I strongly suggest focusing on where two words &ndash; especially on a punchline &ndash; are difficult to say back-to-back. My simple test for when a line doesn’t feel easy to deliver smoothly is to say the line out loud three times in a row, pausing at the end each time.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">What tends to flow well is when two identical short sounds are back-to-back:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I’m sick of that stup<span class="underline">id dru</span>m kit’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The first word flows into the second so nicely that it’s almost one word<i class="calibre3">.</i> These kind of joins are so easy to say that it’s even worth looking out for chances to slip them into set-ups and especially punchlines, as long as it doesn’t affect the content of that joke. If anything I’ve described so far is like waving a magic wand over a joke, it’s applying this method for removing any gabbled sounds that ruin the flow of a set-up or punchline. It’s important that words don’t clash where they join because they can make a sentence feel like a tongue-twister and, at worst, cause your audience to not hear what you’ve said (something I’ve been guilty of). Even if you speak slowly, some sounds can be jarring. So, don’t just focus on the punchlines &ndash; see every sound that’s created by a word or group of words as a potentially beautiful thing. Even if it turns out that they’re not beautiful, or you can’t replace them with beautiful-sounding words, you won’t know unless you look out for the opportunity to make words sound beautiful.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Comedian Arnold Brown and rapper Kool Keith (AKA Dr. Octagon) are two people whose work I’ve admired for longer than I’ve been a comedian. They might appear to do very different things, and they certainly have very different images and predominantly appeal to very different demographics. However, the one thing they have in common is that they both caress their words. They’ll magnify one or more syllables within a word or phrase, to allow their audience to join them in appreciating their love of that particular sound or group of sounds that possibly only they’d previously noticed. If it suits your persona to caress words, these moments can only start to happen once you see every group of words in your show as a potentially beautiful thing. There are trillions of combinations of three words. So, you can actually make a brand-new group of sounds for an audience’s ears just by caressing as few as two words in a row. Occasionally handpicking a group of funny or nice-sounding words is another of the many things that can happen when you appear to be doing something else.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Earlier, I mentioned that you can enjoy watching someone performing stand-up in a language you don’t understand because of the energy in the room. The same obviously applies to movement and facial expressions, but it can also apply to funny-sounding words.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I once had a friend arrive at my gig to collect me. They were early, so caught the last few minutes of my set. They were with a friend who was over from Spain. I saw them standing at the back of the room, and had no idea that their friend hardly spoke any English. Whenever I glanced over, the friend was staring blankly at me, which I found slightly off-putting as I assumed she wasn’t enjoying my gig. Suddenly she laughed at one punchline:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘It could be because he doesn’t brush, it could be ’cause he fights, or it could be ’cause he swapped it for a yo-yo’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">For the record, that punchline was a list of reasons why someone within a story might have lost a front tooth. However, when you read it, I wanted you to only be aware of the rhythm and sounds, because that’s all that the Spanish lady heard. There’s no seesaw, but there is a rule of three (a short list of three things where the punchline lands on the third one). This is what allows the punchline to land well. I apply the rule of three very sparingly because it’s so overused that a very high percentage of non-comedians are aware of it. So, be careful not to use it too often, because the mechanics can start to become obvious. However, that doesn’t mean that applying it skilfully can’t be effective. Anyway, can you guess which bit of the punchline the Spanish lady found funny?</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘…swapped it for a yo-yo’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although it was complete nonsense to her, the sounds those words created were funny enough to make her laugh. She heard:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Blah blah blah blah blah </i>swaptit for a yo-yo<i class="calibre3"> blah blah blah blah blah’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">She certainly wouldn’t have laughed if she’d heard me saying this (change underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘It could be because he doesn’t brush, it could be ’cause he fights, or it could be ’cause he <span class="underline">traded it for an Action Man</span>’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The rest of my audience might have still laughed, but it certainly wouldn’t have had the extra layer of nice-sounding words. I really hope this story shows the impact sounds can have on a punchline.</p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container">
          <img alt="" width="450" src="images/000030.jpeg" height="447" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">Given that it’s possible to make someone laugh at a punchline they don’t understand, assuming it suits your persona to do so, wouldn’t it be a great exercise to imagine someone who doesn’t speak English watching you next time you choose the wording of your next bit of new material? The fact that those people will probably only make up 0.1% of your collective audiences obviously isn’t the point. Think of the extra layer your comedy will have for the people who <span class="underline">do</span> understand it. The more you’re aware of funny-sounding words, the more likely you are to instinctively use them, even when improvising onstage. The entire line ending of <i class="calibre3">‘swapped it for a yo-yo’</i> was improvised onstage the first time I said it. Choosing the wording of that punchline onstage was instinctive, but I wasn’t doing that from day one. I was a funny child who eventually became a comedian and yet I was probably using funnier groups of words for punchlines in my classrooms than I was during my first gig. Why? Simply because writing funny material is harder than being a funny person. You being a funny person is very important, because that’s already within you; I’m just trying to push you towards merging your own instincts with my theories.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’m going to fully illustrate my point with an example of a joke from one of the best ever. I could quote Mitch Hedberg all day, but there’s one very short line of his that I’d like to share with you because of its use of funny-sounding words. Read it to yourself first, and then say it out loud:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I used to do drugs. I still </i>do<i class="calibre3"> drugs, but I used to,</i> too’.</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I wish you could hear Mitch saying this beautiful joke, because it truly is a perfect punchline. It’s clever, succinct, unique to his comic mind, unique to his flow, ends on alliteration with two identical-sounding words that mean two different things and he caresses the final of those two words (‘<i class="calibre3">to tooo’</i>). Wow.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Mitch sadly died in 2005 and is therefore the only comedian I couldn’t get permission from to quote here. I have tried and failed to contact his family, and only hope that, if they’re reading this, they understand my intentions and give me retrospective consent.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Look at how much happens within fourteen syllables. The punchline is so succinct that it doesn’t need a pause or a seesaw. Not only that, all fourteen words are monosyllabic which adds to the flow in this case. Even if you tell stories and not short jokes, this should still inspire you when it comes to using nice sounds. Comedians often quote this line, saying that its genius is in its brevity and the astute observation that, technically speaking, the words <i class="calibre3">‘used to do’</i> shouldn’t have to mean that you don’t do something any more. However, the flow and funny-sounding words are just as important. To prove that, say this new version out loud (change underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I used to do drugs. I still </i>do<i class="calibre3"> drugs, but I used to</i> <i class="calibre3"><span class="underline">as well</span></i>’.</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Not only is the flow off, half of the magic has disappeared from the punchline. The second version is the exact same idea and yet it’s half the joke. I’ve told a story about someone who didn’t speak English laughing at a turn of phrase and have pointed out that <i class="calibre3">‘stupid drum’ </i>is easier to say and a lot nicer to listen to than <i class="calibre3">‘bath theory’</i>. However, pointing out that Mitch Hedberg’s timeless classic wouldn’t be half as good if the final word was changed is hopefully more than enough to inspire you to do some tweaking to your own material, especially the punchlines. If creating funny or punchy sounds doesn’t come naturally to you, put the work in to coming up with some. Your audiences can’t possibly know if you created those sounds by staring at a screen for an hour or if they came to you onstage.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I just remembered something that happened to me recently. I was writing for a comedian who had a brand-new joke that ended on a celebrity’s name and it didn’t land well, especially since their style suited hard final syllables on punchlines. The problem was that the celebrity’s name was the key word of the punchline, and it ended on a soft sound. As you know, I can’t stand soft final syllables on a punchline or a leaking balloon as a result of a key word being halfway through one. To be clear, if I have a key word in the middle of a punchline I move it to the end, and if I have a soft sound at the end, I change it. Since you can’t change someone’s name, it created a paradox.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Earlier I said there wouldn’t be any more made-up punchlines. So, forgive me for this final one, because I wouldn’t ever quote someone having mentioned writing for them as I believe it’s ungracious. Anyway, let’s imagine the joke ends on:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘…and a lady resembling Dusty Springfield’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Not only does this punchline fail to land hard, nearly all of the syllables create soft sounds. In this particular case, I could simply change it to:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘…and a Dusty Springfield lookalike’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s only one word after the key word, plus <i class="calibre3">‘lookalike’</i> is a funny-sounding word. Unfortunately, that approach wasn’t an option with the <span class="underline">actual</span> problem I was faced with. So &ndash; and here’s the revelation &ndash; I eventually solved it by doing something unusual. I discovered that adding a short, punchy word early on in the punchline allowed it to land harder, even though it still ended on a soft final word (change underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">C &ndash;  ‘…and <span class="underline">one</span> lady resembling Dusty Springfield’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Say ‘A’ &amp; ‘C’ out loud back-to-back, heavily emphasising the word <i class="calibre3">‘one’ </i>in ‘C’. Hopefully you can hear that ‘C’ lands harder than ‘A’. Making this change was instinctive and it confused me when it worked because, logically, it shouldn’t make any difference &ndash; and yet it does. The reason ‘C’ works is because the word <i class="calibre3">‘one’ </i>acts as an anchor that holds down an otherwise light punchline.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is a perfect example of why I find language fascinating, and discovering this method that I now call ‘anchoring’ proved that I’m always learning. I hope that you find anchoring useful if you’re ever in a similar situation.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you train your brain to see all the words you say onstage as important and not just the final few words of a punchline, it’s impossible not to improve. Why not put as much effort into choosing groups of words that sound nice together as you put into thinking of original premises? Although it can be very effective to boost a lull within a story by creating tension or adding an extra punchline or two, I often boost a lull by replacing some of the words with nicer-sounding ones. This is surprisingly easy to do and adds texture to that lull, especially if you also take the time to caress those words.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’ve already mentioned that great rappers (and I’d include Dr. Seuss in that group) constantly talk about flow. The main difference between the lyrics of a rap or song and stand-up comedy is that audiences are fully aware that lyrics are written, whereas stand-up often creates an air of spontaneity. So, too many contrived-sounding groups of words can put a very conversational comedian at risk of creating a boom mic moment. However, the occasional tiny burst of lovely sounds certainly wouldn’t hurt.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I look at it this way, if a rapper can tell a four-minute funny story that rhymes intricately and has flow from start to finish, surely we can stick in at least some flow. I certainly don’t claim to be a poet or rapper, but I can still hear that <i class="calibre3">‘po<b class="calibre4"><span class="underline">et or</span></b> rapper’ </i>is easier for me to say than ‘<i class="calibre3">rapp<b class="calibre4"><span class="underline">er or</span></b> poet’.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now I want you to go over a few of your short jokes, or one routine or story, and replace some of the words with funnier or nicer-sounding ones that suit your style and flow. This is a fun exercise and a lot less taxing than closing off exits to mazes. Once you start to fully think about flow, you’ll soon be instinctively inserting it everywhere, while simultaneously adding the occasional funny or nice-sounding group of words and seesaws.</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">Before:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">I certainly don’t claim to be a poet or rapper, but I can still hear that ‘poet or rapper’ is easier for me to say than ‘rapper or poet’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">After:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">I don’t claim to be a rapper, but I know though,</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">That ‘poet or rapper’ has more flow, so</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">I swapped it for a yo-yo.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now, get to work.</p>

      <p class="first1">My mentor is comedians’ comedian Arnold Brown whom I cannot say enough good things about, both as a comedian and a human being. In fact, before I found out the gender of the first of my two daughters, Arnold was on my list of potential boys’ names (plus ‘Arnold Bloom’ is a seesaw). Anyway, here’s the most significant advice he ever gave me:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">“The difference between a performer and an artist is that a performer gives their audience what they think they want, and an artist gives them what they didn’t know they wanted”.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is a very useful quote to have pop into your head every few weeks, because I believe that pandering is the quickest route to mediocrity.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Around fifteen years ago, I was doing a midnight show with Milton Jones. The audience was quite rowdy and there were several large, all-male groups. The comedian onstage had a very laddish, ‘bloke down the pub’ persona and talked about sex, drugs and getting drunk. The audience, especially the large groups of men, loved him and he had a great gig. I should point out that this comedian didn’t adjust his persona to suit that audience, it had always been laddish. However, he clearly brought up all the topics within his arsenal he felt that particular audience would react well to, and he got it right. A few minutes later, Milton (whose persona couldn’t be less laddish) walked onstage with his hair messed up, wearing a multicoloured tank top, and with an otherworldly look in his eyes. His first words were:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">‘<i class="calibre3">Tricky isn’t it, if you’re both a moth and a sea captain? In charge of a ship, but up ahead you see a lighthouse…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The entire audience was instantly gripped. He’d mesmerised them with his weirdness and everyone wanted to know what happened to the moth. Having only been in their lives for a few seconds, he’d caused 400 people to replace all their problems with needing to hear the rest of the joke. Milton went on to have the best gig of the night. Everyone, including the large groups of men (who were quite drunk by this point), enjoyed hearing a laddish comedian being laddish, but they clearly preferred Milton and would have certainly gone home remembering him.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I always remind myself of moments like Milton following a comedian who appeared to perfectly fit their audience. Many of them possibly thought that comedy was about sex and getting drunk and therefore were getting what they thought they wanted. Milton gave them what they didn’t know they wanted. Don’t ever become the comedian who drops all of their cerebral material and even goes slightly out of character to pander to an audience. If you do, I suggest you leave the second you come offstage because, if you stay to watch the rest of the show, you’ll risk feeling pretty stupid if someone does the exact opposite and has a much better gig than you. Even when pandering does<i class="calibre3"> </i>wonders for your gig, that’s time you could have spent getting better at what you do.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’ve seen so many extremely original comedians go on to become very successful as a result of refusing to compromise. They eventually learned to force audiences into their world, and that skill did not come from meeting them halfway. A comedian forcing an audience to get onboard with their uniqueness is like giving a muscle a workout, and compromising will eventually weaken that muscle. You must not overlook this point, especially if you’re doing (or planning on doing) something noticeably different. Do your cerebral stuff at rowdy gigs &ndash; just wait until the right moment. We’ll look closer at this topic in a few minutes.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When it comes to writing material, focusing on being unique involves replacing the question:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">“Could anyone have thought of it?”</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">with:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">“Could another comedian have thought of it?”</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Don’t let this intimidate you; it’s just something for you to consider aiming for eventually. The ultimate goal when it comes to material is for a fan of your work to be able to recognise one of your jokes, routines or stories when someone else quotes it. I believe this has only been achieved by two percent of comedians. Assuming you aren’t already one of them, joining that elite group not only means never taking the ‘<i class="calibre3">I know, but it works’ </i>approach, it also means having a very defined persona and fully understanding the harmony between your persona and material. Although not pandering can sometimes lead to you feeling less confident performing for certain audiences, it does mean that every time you refuse to compromise, you’ll gradually build up more faith in your persona.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Force of conviction is a stunning thing to behold. When I started out, some very original comedians didn’t get past the first hurdle, and watching less original comedians than themselves constantly having better gigs than they had would have no doubt contributed to them losing faith in what they were doing.</p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container2">
          <img alt="" width="600" src="images/000031.jpeg" height="298" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">So, if you’re either a new comedian or at the pre-first gig stage, I not only want to remind you that there’s a potentially incredibly enjoyable career floating around in the ether, waiting to be discovered, I also want to point out two other extremely important things:</p>
      <p class="subsq1">•	Failing at first must <span class="underline">not</span> result in you giving up</p>
      <p class="subsq1">•	Doing something truly original can often make things harder 		at first</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although originality can lead to a very successful career, it often means that the comedian will take longer to get established. However, compromising is far more likely to result in a dead end. So, see the bigger picture. Although I can think of dozens of comedians who are far more original than I am, I still strive for originality and never pander to an audience.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Sometimes it seems like pandering is the only way to succeed onstage, but that’s a misconception. It’s more about connecting with your audience before going on to do your thing. I'll occasionally watch a comedian walk onstage and say or do something that instantly wins over an audience at what feels like a non-event, and then have a successful gig without compromising.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Around twenty years ago, I was part of a show in a marquee full of very old religious people, several of them in wheelchairs. No one was having a good gig and there was clearly a misunderstanding as to the kind of comedy they’d paid to watch. Having seen two comedians struggle badly without ever acknowledging that fact, comedian Bennett Arron walked onstage holding a bottle of beer. He put the beer on the stage, paused, took the mic out of the stand and opened with:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I don’t usually drink, I just thought </i>now<i class="calibre3"> would be a good time to start’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The audience roared with laughter and the gig instantly went from a 2/10 to a 10/10 and stayed there for the entire time Bennett was onstage. He’d addressed the elephant in the room and, as a result of that one line, he could do no wrong in the audience’s eyes. He had the best gig of the night and, although we can never know how his gig would’ve gone if he’d just walked onstage and done the exact set he’d planned on doing without acknowledging the situation, I do know that that line was a perfect example of someone instantly getting an audience onboard at a show that was going badly for everyone. He didn’t pander, he just did one bespoke line and went on to do the set he’d planned. He just popped a huge balloon that had been waiting for forty minutes to be popped.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Do you remember this reason for someone having a flat gig?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">•	The audience didn’t commit to more cerebral jokes because 		they hadn’t warmed to the comedian</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Bennett might have experienced exactly that, had he not said the ultimate opening line for his persona at that particular gig. That audience completely warmed to him as a result of that line, and therefore fully committed to his comedy. An elephant in the room is a massive balloon waiting to be popped. However, if it’s addressed without being funny, the comedian becomes the elephant. Saying something like <i class="calibre3">‘Well, this gig is a bit quiet’</i> instantly makes you the problem, and is a very common thing that newer comedians say at tough gigs. I’ll often turn around a tough gig by making a disclaimer, and I have a dozen of them in my arsenal if I can’t improvise one. However, if a comment about a tough gig isn’t funny, the gig inevitably becomes tougher. So, either be funny about it or ignore it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I grew up watching Barbara Woodhouse on TV. She was a very eccentric dog trainer who’d take people’s badly behaved pet dogs and, within minutes, train them to become well-behaved. It was a joy to watch. She said one thing that really stuck with me:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">“There are no bad dogs, only bad owners”.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Even though most comedians know what an unplayable room looks and feels like, if you treat audiences this way, you’ll not only focus on being original; you’ll also work harder at getting your audiences onboard, rather than talking yourself out of gigs before you’ve even gone onstage (another common self-fulfilling prophecy).</p>
      <p class="subsq1">No matter how dirty a tough gig has left me feeling, Barbara Woodhouse always pops into my head. I’ll ask myself what I could have done to get that audience onboard without compromising artistically. After all, whenever I’ve managed to come up with a bespoke opening line that makes my audience instantly decide that they’re watching a good comedian, I'll go home with a smile on my face, feeling proud that I took the time to come up with that line. So, surely when I leave <span class="underline">not</span> smiling, it’s only right that I ask myself what I could have done better. I have a mantra that I say to myself when I’m about to perform at a tough gig, and it’s a merge of two quotes that I’ve already mentioned:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">“There are no bad audiences. So, give them what they didn’t know they wanted”.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you make this your mantra, you’ll not only focus on being original, you’ll work harder at getting your audiences onboard - rather than predicting a bad gig and then making excuses the second you come offstage.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Some comedians are so proud of their art that they refuse to compromise in any way. I believe that there’s a huge difference between telling a ten-minute story when an audience isn’t fully focused on the stage, and choosing to interact for a few minutes to change the dynamic in the room before starting it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Comedians often see themselves as fitting into one of two groups:</p>
      <p class="subsq1">•	Artists</p>
      <p class="subsq1">•	Crowd-pleasers</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I strongly believe that there’s a third group:</p>
      <p class="subsq1">•	Artists who are prepared to work a room</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Working a room before doing something original is not the same as pandering. If you want to be a crowd-pleaser I obviously can’t stop you doing that, and it might lead to a successful and fun career. However, if you see yourself as an artist, it certainly doesn’t mean you become a crowd-pleaser the second you make an effort to get an audience onboard, before you then go on to do your thing.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I see the start of a gig as being like a boat trip, and my audience is a group of people standing on the shore. If no one gets onboard, there’s absolutely no point sailing off. So, you have to entice them onto the boat if they have chosen not to board it. Don’t confuse enticing with pandering. I would never change what I do to please an audience, but I’d certainly consider my initial approach before forcing an audience into my world. For example, telling a gentle story very early on in your set to an audience who are constantly heckling and trying to make the night about them can result in disaster. However, doing shorter bits at the start would mean that there is nowhere near the same risk of an interruption doing any real damage. Instead, get everyone onboard using material or techniques that suit your persona before moving on to doing your thing. With enough conviction you’ll be doing exactly what material you want to do, two to three minutes into your gig. You can do an A-to-Z set, but you have to accept the outcome if things don’t go to plan. I should point out that there’s a massive difference between adjusting your approach at the start of a gig and avoiding certain topics at a private event. They’re two completely different things.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Finally, I’d like to take a look at two creative industries: fine art and advertising. A client will tell an advertising agency exactly whom they want their product to appeal to, and therefore the image they want to get across. Despite necessity being the mother of invention, this situation is slightly different to when a comedian restricts themselves before writing new material, because in advertising, there are often so many restrictions that it can be very hard to be creative and still tick several boxes. The creatives then come up with several ideas and, regardless of which one they prefer, the advert that gets made is the one that the client is most happy with. An artist, however, is completely free to paint whatever they want and, when it’s finished, people either buy their painting or they don’t. Given that your client isn’t asking anything of you, of the two, shouldn’t you be the artist?</p>

    <div class="title-page-contributor-primary-block" id="calibre_link-136">
      <p class="first1">When I watch some of the masters of stand-up from long ago, I often notice that their timing can make the difference between a punchline knocking their audience off their feet and it not existing. It seems to me that timing is less prominent in modern comedy. This has possibly got something to do with today's audiences having shorter attention spans and, as a result, comedians often rush to get to their punchlines.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Before we look closely at timing, I’d like to acknowledge that some comedians’ styles are so conversational that too many unnatural pauses put them at risk of giving away that their thoughts and opinions are actually jokes and, to prevent that from happening, they make sure there aren’t too many (if any) noticeably long pauses. However, although constantly using noticeable comic timing doesn’t suit everyone’s style, timing still has to exist.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Possibly the most conversational comedian of all the ones I watched growing up is Jerry Seinfeld. The one time I saw him live I watched him carefully to see if he ever broke from what felt like someone just chatting. He didn’t, although there was one moment when he created a very long pause after a build-up of rolling energy that ended with him exposing a brutal truth about how little his audience’s wedding guests care about their weddings. The laugh was huge, and Seinfeld was in complete control of both our breathing and our emotions. My point is that, not only was that pause vital to create the build-up of energy needed for the huge balloon pop that followed it, it wasn’t a boom mic moment because, as noticeable as it was, it was a semi-natural thing for a funny person to do. So, if a comedian as conversational as Jerry Seinfeld can pause for almost an entire second before one punchline within a fifty-minute set, so can ninety-five percent of comedians. The five percent to whom this doesn’t apply are making a huge effort to just seem like they’re a person having a chat and, if that’s your agenda, I strongly suggest you avoid creating any boom mic moments because they’re infinitely more damaging than the occasional long pause.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Around once a week I’ll watch a comedian hit a really nice punchline and think, <i class="calibre3">‘There definitely should have been a pause there’.</i> Sometimes a short pause towards the end of a punchline is like the comedian taking a yellow highlighter pen and underlining when the funny moment is just about to happen. This might feel slightly contrived for some comedians’ styles, but you can get around this by making that pause shorter. Also, if that punchline follows tension or rolling energy, that pause will force the energy to momentarily hang in the air, building it up even more just before the punchline. Even if that pause is very short, it will still intensify the energy.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Another thing that can be achieved during that same pause is to allow an audience to fully absorb the previous information. If the final word of a punchline follows a lot of information, it can leave an audience not knowing what happened because their brains have been overloaded with information (and not in a good way). If you talk very quickly onstage, a tiny pause at the right moment can be very effective. If anything, it can be even more effective than usual because of the speed that you’re talking at. If there’s enough momentum before a long pause, you can literally prevent your audience from breathing out. The difference here is that there’s no missing laugh, and you only control their breath for a split second. When done well and with the right amount of rolling energy, it’s like the audience is swimming and then going underwater for a second. Here’s why:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">The set-up is the swimming</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The pause is when the audience go underwater</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The punchline is when you <span class="underline">allow</span> them to come up for air</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">This is energy conducting at its most powerful. If your audience doesn’t go underwater, they won’t experience that intense moment when they resurface. So, even a short pause can create suspense, and yet I must have seen a thousand good punchlines lack that moment. If there’s a pause where your audience is dying to know what happens next, make them wait. That pause rounds everyone up and then pushes them underwater. This might seem like the most obvious method I’ve described so far, but if I were to casually bring this up in a dressing-room, having seen a comedian fail to apply a much-needed pause as many as three times within a twenty-minute set, they’d no doubt nod in agreement like it’s something they’re not guilty of doing themselves.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The fact is that comedians are often so keen to reveal a punchline that they forget to add any suspense to the suspense they assume is already there. This is a big mistake, especially at the times when the set-up didn’t create any suspense whatsoever.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">During a TV drama, the first advert break often starts immediately after a tense moment in the plot. If their audience can wait three minutes to find out what happens next, yours can certainly commit to half a second. If a pause is missing and it’s followed by an ineffective final word, I often barely consider it to be a punchline. It’s tragic to watch a great premise result in a tepid reaction when all that’s needed to make it very strong is a short pause followed by a punchy word.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look at the reasons a missing pause can sabotage a punchline:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">There wasn’t enough suspense before the final word</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The audience couldn’t process the information leading up to the final word</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The comedian failed to misdirect the audience</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Misdirection relies solely on the audience thinking they’re ahead of you, and a pause is almost inevitably needed to make sure that happens. With my cat joke, if you take the pause out it doesn’t work:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Little tip. If you’ve got cats and you’re sick of being covered in cat hair, get some Sellotape and wrap it around your cat’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">In the original version, there’s a pause immediately after <i class="calibre3">‘get some Sellotape…’</i> which gives my audience enough time to assume I’m about to say:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘…and wrap it around your hand’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This may seem obvious to you, but here’s where it gets interesting. Very often, a comedian fails to add the relevant pause because they don’t know that misdirection can exist in the punchline. Basically, they’ve written a nice joke that works without a pause, but aren’t aware that a pause would add a whole new layer to that punchline. I’m sure I’ve been guilty of this several times, but the one time it was drawn to my attention was in 2002. I had a routine about stage-fright and explained that a firefighter once told me that he’d be terrified to go onstage. At the end of a passionate monologue about how ridiculous it was for someone who does that job to be scared of standing in front of an audience, on the back of lots of rolling energy, I added:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I’m thirty-one years old and I would </i>never<i class="calibre3"> risk my life running in to a burning building because some old person’s put a VHS tape into a…toaster’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I realise this doesn’t sell itself well in print because it’s emotional, but it was always greeted with a huge laugh. By the way, this isn’t a seesaw, it’s a long punchline (on the back of rolling energy) with a pause on the offbeat as I appear to be choosing the final word. At least that’s what I wanted it to look like was happening.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">One night, I forgot to add the pause. After my gig, comedian friend Ed Byrne came up to me and passionately said:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘You didn’t pause before the word “toaster”’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I remember thinking that he was right, but couldn’t see why it was a big deal to him. What he then said completely took me by surprise:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘You have to pause long enough for everyone to assume that you’re about to say “because some old person’s put a VHS tape into a Betamax machine”’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you’re under forty, you probably won’t know that Betamax is an obsolete type of video player. So, Ed had watched me perform that line a handful of times and was thinking something completely different happened during the pause. To me, the line was purely emotional, but Ed had perceived it as ending on misdirection. His interpretation was stronger than the one I’d intended because it was a double punch (misdirection and strong mental image). So, I’d inadvertently created a joke with misdirection.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">As long as there was a pause, my audience had a choice of two interpretations of what happened during that pause:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">I was deciding what the old person had put a VHS tape into</li>
        <li class="calibre6">I’d misdirected my audience into thinking I was about to say <i class="calibre3">‘Betamax machine’</i></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">However, both interpretations result in the same thing: a mental image of a toaster on fire with a VHS tape inside it. Does it bother me that, of the two interpretations, the second one has a slightly stronger punchline? It’s not ideal. However, both versions are very effective, they both end with the same mental image and, most importantly, no one gets confused.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s time for you to benefit from this story. Since I often watch comedians not realise that a pause before the final word of a punchline could have added misdirection that they didn’t know had the potential to be there, I want you to look at any lines that have surprise right at the end, especially ones that are getting inconsistent reactions, and ask yourself if a pause before the final word (or few words) could make them stronger. This is a great exercise because, even if you don’t find any reasons to pause, it gets you used to putting yourself in the minds of your audience. Only when you fully know why something is funny can you tweak it, and make it as clear and funny as it can possibly be. Learn how to dissect a frog because the benefits are endless.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s another lesson I’ve learned about pausing. Occasionally, when I’m doing a newish bit, I’ll happen to pause longer than normal at the end of a set-up and the audience will laugh for no apparent reason. What’s happened is beautiful because my audience have just given me a gift. They’ve collectively found humour that I hadn’t spotted when I came up with that bit of material. Here are some funny things that you might not have realised were in some of your set-ups:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">A collection of funny-sounding words</li>
        <li class="calibre6">A funny mental image</li>
        <li class="calibre6">A funny movement or facial expression</li>
        <li class="calibre6">A nice observation that you’d only previously seen as information</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">By allowing moments like these to breathe, you can suddenly make them come to life. Isn’t it odd that a comedian can be saying or doing something funny night after night and not realise that it’s funny? More importantly, isn’t it beautiful that your audience can point those moments out to you? When this happens, I’ll look over the line and, sure enough, there’s a funny detail that I hadn’t even intended to exist. I will then continue to pause at that exact moment whenever I perform that bit, only with confidence. That confidence helps the audience to spot that moment.</p>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container">
          <img alt="" width="450" src="images/000032.jpeg" height="419" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">The next stage is to look at that moment and see if it can be slightly tweaked or improved (e.g. reverse engineering more detail into it). What can we take from this? When an audience is at their most receptive, they’re not just enjoying comedy, they’re looking out for it. So, surely we should take advantage of that fact and squeeze as much detail as possible into our set-ups, to reward those audiences. Since they can’t fully know where all the punchlines are supposed to be, let them find them. The surprise ending of a story is clearly a punchline and therefore, if it fails, that moment is obvious to everyone. However, the beauty of a set-up is that any detail within that set-up is a bonus. So, the pressure’s off. Given that the pressure’s off and given that set-ups can drag on, why make everyone wait for that funny moment when they could potentially be enjoying the journey to it? A few tiny pauses can allow even the smallest of details to be spotted.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">You might be thinking <i class="calibre3">‘I thought you wanted me to see myself as like being a sniper on a roof’.</i> I do, but to keep this simile working, it doesn’t hurt to also plant a few little landmines. Although, I’d rather you saw them as Easter eggs, and all it takes for your audience to find them is a tiny pause.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Finally, there’s one more reason to pause that’s often overlooked by comedians. During an act-out of a scene within a joke, routine or story, they’ll describe something that happened and then follow it up with a punchline. Since that punchline could only exist as a result of someone within the act-out witnessing or experiencing something, it’s important that their audience also experiences the time it took for the train of thought just before that punchline to occur. I’ll give you an example. Comedian Mark Maier has a brilliant routine about a neighbour having a sign outside his house saying ‘<i class="calibre3">Have you seen our cat?</i>’ The routine that immediately follows it is about the same neighbour having another sign on his garage door saying ‘<i class="calibre3">Driveway in constant use</i>’. At the end of the second routine, the man reverses his car. This is what happened next:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">LOUD SPLATTING SOUND. PAUSE. MARK LOOKS DOWN.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">MARK (ENTHUSIASTICALLY): Ooh!…I think I’ve just seen your cat. (1 / 7)</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, this is a topper in the form of a callback. Let’s look at what Mark experiences during that pause between him hearing the splatting sound and delivering the punchline:</p>
      <p class="subsq1">•	He sees a car slowly driving forward, revealing a dead cat</p>
      <p class="subsq1">•	He recognises the cat from a poster</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Not only does the pause create anticipation (Mark’s audience have no idea what caused the noise), given how much damage a car would do slowly running over a cat, it isn’t realistic for Mark to immediately recognise a squashed cat that he’d only briefly seen in a photo. So, that pause is what makes the scene believable. Even though his audience knows that it’s a joke, it’s still important to make it believable. If Mark hadn’t allowed for the time it took to have his train of thought, the punchline would have still worked because his audience had all the information for it to exist, but it wouldn’t be as strong. When you think about it, depriving your audience of witnessing the time it takes for you (or someone else) to have a train of thought before reacting risks taking them out of the moment. This creates what I call a ‘mini boom mic moment’ because, if any of your audience is thinking ‘<i class="calibre3">That wouldn’t happen’</i>, they’re not present and are therefore far less likely to laugh. Just like all the times you’ve watched a film and thought <i class="calibre3">‘That wouldn’t happen’</i>, a missing pause in an act-out can take the realism away. So, don’t underestimate the power of pausing at the right moments during an act-out, no matter how subtle.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Those are all my thoughts on timing. Isn’t it wonderful that you can achieve so much by doing nothing?</p>

    <div class="title-page-contributor-primary-block" id="calibre_link-138">
      <p class="first1">This is going to be a short chapter, as I don’t feel that improvised stand-up (not to be confused with group improv) can really be taught the same way that writing and performing methods can be explained. However, there’s one area of improv that I’d like to go over with you, because it can directly enhance the material either side of it. Some comedians bang out one-liners and it’s clear that they’re telling jokes, but if your style creates the illusion of chatting to your audience, moments of improv add beautifully to that illusion, because you literally are chatting to your audience, no matter how brief those moments are. Even if improv isn’t your thing or you’re terrified of doing it, I strongly urge you to start the occasional routine with an ad lib or make an aside about what’s already happened in the room at any particular gig. This could be a reference to a previous comment by an audience member, or a line from someone else’s set. Just like keeping an eye out for toppers as you write out existing material, it’s good to look out for connections between what happens in the room (before and during your gig) and your material. No one is expecting you to do this, so the pressure’s off.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">One ad lib every five minutes does wonders to prevent a conversational style from seeming like a recital. Merging the smallest amount of improv with your prepared stuff can make it impossible for the audience to see exactly where the improv ends and the material starts. This creates a gradual fade from improv to crafted jokes, routines or stories. Done well, it tricks the audience into thinking that some of your material is also improvised. I don’t mean that you need to trick an audience into thinking that your material isn’t material, which is the agenda for some comedians; I’m suggesting this so that the improv flows naturally into your crafted material. That way, there’s no moment when the audience hears you taking the next record out of its sleeve.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I brushed on this phrase earlier:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Anyway, back to my set’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Saying this is the worst possible way to go from improv back to material, because you’re as good as reminding your audience that you were reciting a script before you started improvising, and are now going back to that script. A more subtle version of this that’s far less damaging is:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Anyway, where was I?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is at least something we all say in conversation. I said <i class="calibre3">‘less damaging’</i> because, in the wrong hands, the intonation can still hint at going back to a script. Ultimately, I like to try to find a link between the improv and the material I’m going back to, so there’s no join. This creates a bridge, and is a technique we’ll look at closer in the next chapter.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Little bits of improv here and there also do something else that’s very effective: they force you to stay in the moment by grounding you every now and again, stopping you from ever slipping into autopilot (which is never a good thing). This forces your mind to stop wandering.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I often see a comedian’s eyes glaze over and can tell that they’ve got bored. Not only is this damaging for your soul, if the audience sense that it’s happened, it’s very likely that your gig will soon dip. It only happens to me once every few weeks and, if I catch myself drifting, I’ll ask the audience or someone in the front row a question, forcing me to be present. This question can be about anything, but the subject that you’re already talking about makes more sense. One tiny bit of interaction can be enough to release a few endorphins and switch your eyes back on. I should also point out that it’s important to be present moments before you walk onstage. It’s easier to be connected with a room the moment you appear onstage if you’re already present seconds beforehand. So, during that minute before you go onstage, unless you’re looking at notes on your phone, get off your phone.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Sometimes I’ll watch a comedian have a great gig, but not ask a single question until the last three minutes. This is a real waste of an opportunity, because interacting earlier on in your gig is far more effective. If you only ask one question and it’s one to three minutes from the start of your gig, everyone can see that you’re an actual person who is also present in the room. This breaks down the very thin fourth wall, making you more human for the remaining time you’re onstage.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">One of my strongest childhood memories is being given a Bionic Man transfer that I put on my arm. It was probably only one square centimetre, but it showed the workings within an electrical circuit. It felt amazing wearing it, because it was a window into how my entire body would look if you pulled my skin off. I see equally small amounts of improv as having the same effect when that improv happens just before meticulously written material, as it makes that material feel far more natural. This is like wearing a Bionic Man transfer because, although it only covers a small percentage of your gig, it will do wonders for how the rest of it will appear.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">In the chapter about first impressions, I talked about walking onstage without any agenda as you approach the mic. This method doesn’t suit everyone, but even if you don’t improvise once in your entire career, having a bespoke opening line can do wonders for how you’re perceived by your audience. A 100% scripted conversational set, no matter how well-performed, will look even more natural if you open with one of the following:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">A joke about the venue</li>
        <li class="calibre6">A joke about something that happened in the news that week (if it suits your persona)</li>
        <li class="calibre6">A joke about something that was said or happened earlier on in the show / just before you went onstage</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">With the exception of the last one, you have plenty of time to think about that line, and all of those things can give your entire show an air of freshness, regardless of how old the material that follows it might be. Sitting in the dressing-room talking, rather than watching the show, means that you’ll miss the opportunity to come up with a line about what’s happened in the room. If being in a dressing-room helps you to get your head together before you go onstage, that’s fine. However, if you don’t need to do that, not watching the show ultimately means that you’re missing out on a chance to write a bespoke line about the night. I’ve been guilty of doing this, but I try to at least watch some of the show to not only pick up on the energy in the room, but also as an opportunity to write a bespoke opening line. If you can make your audience laugh with a comment that you clearly thought of minutes (or even seconds) before you walk onstage, they will instantly gain confidence in your ability as a comedian and relax. This is a beautiful thing to witness, and I’ve worked with some incredible comedians who’ve opened with a bespoke line about the room or city they’re in every single night of a tour. So, regardless of your style of comedy, it’s very effective to find something that suits your persona to say as soon as you walk onstage, or early on in your show.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Either way, improvised stand-up is a journey you have to go on alone and, if it’s not your strength, then focus on the other areas. Some of my favourite comedians almost only improvise and some of them as good as never do. Perhaps this chapter should’ve been called ‘Avoiding Improvising’.</p>

            <h1 class="element-title2">HECKLING</h1>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="title-page-contributor-primary-block" id="calibre_link-140">
      <p class="first1">If I was browsing through a bookshop and I picked up a book on stand-up comedy and there was a chapter on heckling, I’d probably cringe.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Just like with improvising, dealing with hecklers is a journey you need to go on alone. However, I’d like to make two important points and share one very useful method of mine that I’ve been using for years. If you’re new to doing stand-up or haven’t done your first gig yet, seeing the word <i class="calibre3">‘heckling’ </i>just now might have instantly put fear in you. I can assure you that it takes a hell of a lot for an entire audience to turn on a comedian, and one heckler is extremely unlikely to cause that to happen. People have come out and parted with money solely to have fun and, once you’ve got that ingrained in your mind, it will start to become so much easier arriving at a venue to do a gig. So much so, that you’ll eventually start to see an audience as your friend and a heckler as everyone’s enemy. Since your audience wants you to do well, responding well to a heckle can very often be the one thing that saves you from having a bad gig.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s a perfect example. When I was very new, I was the other comedian doing an open spot on a bill with the hugely gifted Julian Barratt of The Mighty Boosh at a rowdy gig. We both struggled and came close to dying onstage. However, at the lowest point of Julian’s gig, a man aggressively shouted <i class="calibre3">‘Goodnight!’ </i>Julian paused and casually replied <i class="calibre3">‘Not really, no’. </i>It was beautiful. Julian had effortlessly made a nasty heckle seem like a caring question, and the audience loved him for it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s the important part; the energy in the room instantly went from 2/10 to 10/10. So, the heckler who was kicking someone when they were down had inadvertently given them the chance to completely turn the gig around, and Julian took full advantage of that moment. When the energy in a gig is at its lowest, dealing with confrontation allows that energy to change for the better in a millisecond. Thank God for hecklers.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Coming out of character to deal with a heckler is one of the cringiest things I’ve ever seen happen onstage. If you’re low status, passively exposing a heckler’s flaws when they interrupt you is arguably even more effective than being noticeably brutal, because it’s taking the ‘less is more’ approach.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When I was new, I was so nervous that I used to often contradict my persona when dealing with hecklers by being harsh when it wasn’t deserved. When that happens early on in your gig, unless your style is aggressive or confrontational, there’s no turning back. Once an audience has made their minds up about what you’re really like, everything you say from that moment onwards, regardless of how warm and playful your persona is, will suddenly seem fake. At its worst, this can be like grabbing the boom mic and stamping on it, resulting in your audience watching a silent movie.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’d like to address one more thing on this topic purely because I believe most comedians have the wrong attitude towards it. The way I see it, in comedy, a huge percentage of heckles aren’t actually heckles. Politicians get heckled. What about the enthusiastic audience members who want to join in? Technically, that’s not a heckle, so shouldn’t be treated like one. Yes, it can be annoying, but it certainly doesn’t mean that person is out to annoy you and deserves to get the same treatment as someone who’s just interrupted you mid-punchline to aggressively tell you that you’re not funny. They’re clearly very different situations, and it’s down to how secure the comedian feels onstage that determines the different ways that they’ll respond in that situation. I can’t make you secure overnight, but I can adjust your mindset.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’d say there are four reasons why an audience member will choose to shout something out at a comedian, and I’ve divided them into percentages based on my genuine perspective:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">To insult the comedian -  10%</li>
        <li class="calibre6">To throw the comedian off -  10%</li>
        <li class="calibre6">To point out that the comedian has offended them -  20%</li>
        <li class="calibre6">To add something positive to the show -  60%</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Although these are obviously estimated percentages, let’s assume for now that they’re accurate. If you look at them for a minute, these statistics will only ring true to you if you have a positive attitude to being heckled. If I am right, that means that a ‘heckle’ is far more likely to be positive than negative, which is why I’ll be writing that word in inverted commas from now on.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, why do so many comedians go on the defensive most of the time? I believe that this is because it’s human nature to see any form of interruption as that person being rude. It’s certainly rude to talk over someone. However, since there’s an etiquette to interrupting, such as waiting for a lull and slipping in a couple of words, you need to condition your brain to not assume that all ‘hecklers’ are out to get you. Unfortunately, so many comedians’ lists would look something like this:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">To insult the comedian -  40%</li>
        <li class="calibre6">To throw the comedian off -  35%</li>
        <li class="calibre6">To point out that the comedian has offended them -  20%</li>
        <li class="calibre6">To add something positive to the show -  5%</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">The root of the problem is that some comedians see an entire audience as potentially being their enemy and, if that’s your mindset, a ‘heckle’ will instantly confirm that. Even if I’m wrong and my approach leads you to make a wrong call, it’s still likely to defuse a negative situation because you’ll be killing them with kindness, which can be very effective (if it suits your persona).</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I remember seeing an extremely right-wing politician being interviewed on TV, and he took questions from the audience (clearly ones that had been vetted first). The audience members’ questions made it very clear that they felt his beliefs were abhorrent, and yet he responded every time by laughing at their comments as if they were having fun together. As equally abhorrent as I found his views, what he’d done was masterful. He prevented his enemies from being able to attack him by behaving like they were his friends. If your next ‘heckle’ comes from a good place, imagine how much more fun you can have and how much nicer you’ll come across.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If it doesn’t suit your persona to be brutal to someone who means well, think of the damage being brutal will do to an audience’s impression of you. By all means, be as brutal as your persona suggests you should be, just consider how you’ll come across. Don’t be surprised if an audience decides that your response is unjustified, and that big brain of theirs is rarely wrong.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When I first saw Eddie Murphy’s <i class="calibre3">Raw</i>, I was blown away. There were so many amazing routines and act-outs, and yet the moment I remember most vividly was Eddie Murphy responding to someone in the audience shouting out something funny by joining that person and the audience in laughing at it. It not only made him human, it also showed that he was secure enough to not worry when someone else momentarily stole the limelight from him. This really stuck with me, as a non-comedian dreaming of one day becoming a comedian.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">A long time ago, I did a show at a university in Scotland. There was heavy snow, and the audience patiently waited over three hours for the comedians to arrive and start the show. The room was packed, and the MC walked onstage and their opening line was a short joke that started with an inoffensive, rhetorical question. A female student in the front row chose to take it as a real question and responded with a very witty answer. The people who heard it laughed. It was innocent, she didn’t insult anyone and, technically speaking, she hadn’t even interrupted the comedian &ndash; she’d answered a question (albeit a rhetorical one). Yet the comedian, whom the audience had just waited three hours to see, dismissively stated <i class="calibre3">‘I’ll do the jokes’. </i>They then did their version of the punchline, which got a much smaller reaction than the girl’s one. This is a classic case of allowing an insecurity to stamp on a beautiful moment. Instead of reprimanding her in an attempt to establish his authority, the comedian could have aborted the joke and said something like:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Wow, you just waited three hours to hear that joke and your punchline was funnier than mine’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I don’t know what I’d have said in the moment had it been me onstage that evening, and I’ve obviously had plenty of time to come up with that response. However, if Eddie Murphy had taught me anything, it was to embrace an audience member joining in. This teenage girl had politely waited three hours to watch a show and was being told off for answering a question.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">As an exercise in looking at things from an audience’s perspective, let’s ask ourselves what the ‘heckler’s’ intentions probably were. She wasn’t out to insult the comedian as she’d made a joke that wasn’t at his expense. So, it seems clear to me that she wanted to add something positive to the show. Yes, my statistics were optimistic, but if you choose to view things that way, you’re far more likely to instinctively see the good in people. If it suits your persona not to be kind to your audience, that’s fine. However, regardless of your persona, when you respond to anything an audience member says, that immediate, democratic audience vote will decide if your response was justified, regardless of how you want to be perceived by them.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s the method I want to share with you. The most important skill a comedian can have when it comes to dealing with any form of chaos is bridging that chaos with the material they plan on returning to. When it comes to going back to material after something unexpected has just happened during a gig, I can spot an amateur in seconds.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Let’s create a hypothetical worst-case scenario where a missing bridge can ruin a gig. In this situation, a comedy magician is going to get heckled:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">LOUD TALKING AT THE FRONT TABLE BY SOMEONE WHO’S ALREADY BEEN ASKED TWICE TO BE QUIET BY SECURITY.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">MAGICIAN: I’d like to put my guitar down for a minute and show you some magic. I’d appreciate it if you’d stop talking.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER: (SHOUTING) I hate magic!</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">TWO MEMBERS OF SECURITY COME OVER AND ASK THEM TO LEAVE. THERE’S A SCUFFLE. THE HECKLER IS REMOVED FROM THE AUDIENCE.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">MAGICIAN: (IGNORING EVERYTHING THAT’S JUST HAPPENED) Madam, could you name any playing card in the deck?</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">THE AUDIENCE IS PRETENDING TO WATCH THE SHOW, BUT IS DISTRACTED BY THE NOISE AT THE BACK OF THE VENUE WHERE AN ARGUMENT HAS STARTED.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">MAGICIAN: (TO AUDIENCE) Please concentrate on the stage.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">MAGICIAN: (TO FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER) Could you name any playing card in the deck?</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">THE REST OF THE GROUP AT THE FRONT TABLE PUT ON THEIR COATS AND LEAVE TO JOIN THEIR FRIEND WHO’S JUST BEEN DRAGGED OUT.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER: Seven of Diamonds.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">MAGICIAN: Now, we’ve never met before, have we?</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER: No, never.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">MAGICIAN: (JOKING) Then, how do you know it’s me?</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">SILENCE.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">MAGICIAN: You could have said any of the fifty-two cards and you chose the Seven of Diamonds.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">THE MAGICIAN TAKES OUT A WALLET FROM THEIR BLAZER POCKET AND PRODUCES THE SEVEN OF DIAMONDS FROM IT. ONLY TWENTY PERCENT OF THE AUDIENCE APPLAUD BECAUSE THE REST OF THEM ARE STILL IN A DAZE.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, the card trick failed purely because there wasn’t a bridge between the bad energy created by the heckler being removed and the magician returning to the card trick, and the outcome was disastrous.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I told a white lie earlier. The hypothetical situation I just described actually happened twenty years ago; I was there. By the way, it’s acceptable to quote the <i class="calibre3">‘Then, how do you know it’s me?’</i> line as it wasn’t that magician’s material, just a very old stock line.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Earlier, I mentioned that having an A-to-Z set only fully works if everything goes to plan. Although it might seem a lot to ask of someone to edit out cubes in the moment and move them to just after rolling energy, I’d say the least a performer can do is acknowledge that their audience might struggle to instantly go from being worried about getting punched in the crossfire of a scuffle to remembering the name of a playing card. So, what could have happened if this magician had considered building a bridge between the chaos and their original agenda? Let’s look at some of their options:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">A:  </b>Commentate on the altercation as if it’s a spectator sport being broadcast on TV, while accompanying it with gentle music (music obviously helps, but this can be done without music)</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">B:  </b>Get the audience’s empathy by saying exactly what they’re thinking such as ‘I was about to show you a card trick, but let’s be honest, you’ve just found something far more entertaining to watch’</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">C:  </b>Tell a story about chaos</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There are obviously an infinite number of situations involving chaos that could happen during a show, and ‘A’ &amp; ‘B’ are just examples of how to deal with this particular situation and a few similar ones. However, I’m going to share with you an extremely useful tool. ‘C’ is the equivalent of having a skeleton key for bridging any chaos with your original agenda. Telling a story about chaos, no matter how brief &ndash; either about the worst situation you’ve ever been in onstage or a true or made-up story (depending on which suits your style of comedy) &ndash; allows you to go back to doing material without there being a ‘needle hitting the record’ moment. It’s very simple and looks like this:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">Chaos  </i></b>→<i class="calibre3">  <b class="calibre4">Address chaos  </b></i>→<i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4"> </b> <b class="calibre4">‘C’</b>  </i>→<b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">  Original agenda</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The beauty of this is that it allows you to make the energy shift seamless and, if you’re not comfortable improvising, you don’t have to spend more than a few seconds addressing the chaos. So, by following chaos with a story about chaos, you can slip back to your original agenda because the material acts as a bridge between the chaos and your original agenda.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">You might be thinking <i class="calibre3">‘I don’t have a story about chaos’.</i> Then come up with one. It can be as short as forty-five seconds long, and only needs one punchline to exorcise the tension in the room before going back to the material you intended doing. Once you get used to having this skeleton key, you’ll become more and more comfortable whenever you’re faced with any form of interruption. It really is like having a bridge in your pocket.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I once saw an audience member punch another audience member when I was onstage. They were immediately removed from the building and there was very little I could have done to be more interesting than that situation. Luckily, I had some material about seeing someone getting punched, which at least helped to take some of my audience’s focus away from what had just happened. A story about going fishing clearly wouldn’t have gone down as well.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">You might be thinking <i class="calibre3">‘Not everyone has a wealth of material to draw from’. </i>They don’t, and that’s exactly why it’s so useful to have a skeleton key. Although I’ve given you a method for avoiding doing much improv when you’re faced with chaos, I urge you to experiment with reacting to chaos before applying ‘C’. Even if that magician’s improv skills were so good that it resulted in them getting the arresting police officer to name a playing card, they would have still benefited from <span class="underline">then</span> telling a story about chaos to bridge their final bit of improv<i class="calibre3"> </i>with their next bit of material. So, it’s a very useful technique.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although dealing with ‘hecklers’ can’t be taught, understanding bridging can. Since chaos in one form or another is going to happen to every comedian at some point, if you take the time to design various bridges within your material, it will hugely improve your ability to build them on the spot. We’re back to knowing exactly what’s going on in the majority of your audience’s minds at any given time.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I certainly don’t claim to be bulletproof, and every comedian makes wrong calls onstage that they immediately regret. All I know is that having a choice of two short stories about chaos has saved me from facing a huge clunk in the room well over a hundred times. Feel free to improvise for ten minutes and then build a bridge on the spot; I’m just offering you a way to avoid having to do that.</p>

      <p class="subsq1">To recap, here are the three most significant things that I’ve learned about this topic:</p>
      <ol class="calibre7">
        <li value="1" class="calibre6">Since audiences want your gig to go well, being heckled isn’t always a bad thing</li>
        <li value="2" class="calibre6">If you choose not to see all audience comments as heckles, you’ll be far more likely to embrace them</li>
        <li value="3" class="calibre6">If you build bridges between chaos and your material, you’ll avoid there being a clunk in the room</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="subsq1">To help you to apply ‘2’ (assuming you don’t already), here’s a way of reframing things. See the stage as a park, and you’re standing in that park with a football, keeping the ball in the air. If the ball goes near someone who happens to be walking past and they kick the ball back to you, you’d be grateful. Especially if it was a good kick. Even if that person came over and joined you for two minutes, you’d still probably not only appreciate their company, you’ll also have an opportunity to display even more of your football skills, things you wouldn’t have been able to do on your own.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I realise that improv doesn’t suit everyone. So, if you don’t like to improvise onstage, ignore the part about displaying more football skills &ndash; just don’t see the person coming over as your enemy. What’s the worst thing that can happen if you’re wrong? You’ll be showing love to someone who isn’t being nice to you, and can adjust accordingly when you realise you’d got it wrong. Isn’t that better than not being nice to someone who’s showing you love? I just wanted to point out that there’s a massive difference between someone passing a ball back at the perfect height for you to head it back to them, and them sticking a broken bottle in it. If you just thought of a better metaphor than sticking a broken bottle in a football, I should remind you that I’ll do the jokes.</p>

      <p class="first1">Swearing is a topic that divides comedians. There are some who feel that it’s a great tool when used skilfully on a punchline, and there are some who feel that it’s a poor substitute for content and that using it at all cheapens your comedy. I don’t want to influence you to join either camp, because I believe that they both have a point.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I think that Eminem is the most talented lyricist of our generation. In his track <i class="calibre3">The Real Slim Shady</i> he mentions that <i class="calibre3">‘Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records’</i> and then claims that he (Eminem) does. Eminem clearly doesn’t have to swear; it’s an artistic choice and it suits his style to do it. So, for anyone to feel superior to him for swearing would be ridiculous. However, it’s no coincidence that there are around 400 words on that track before he swears.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">This brings me to the third camp: comedians who swear so freely that it loses impact. Swearing in a set-up is pretty much redundant. I know several comedians who feel that they can justify swearing in their set-ups as well as in their punchlines because they swear in their normal lives. However, without an extremely strong persona that works in harmony with swearing that often, I feel that justifying swearing on set-ups because it’s how someone speaks offstage is a poor excuse. Those comedians also urinate in their normal lives, but that doesn’t justify them doing it onstage. Even if you swear ten times on your punchlines within a twenty-minute set, you’ll still be taking some of the impact away if you also swear in your set-ups. If this inspires you to take some swear words out, but are worried that it might ruin the flow of a set-up, simply replace them with words that fit the original flow and, with enough emphasis, the same attitude can be achieved with intonation instead of swearing.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’ve often reworded a punchline for a corporate client who’s specifically requested that I don’t swear at their event, and have ended up continuing to do the new version because it turned out that, as long as the flow was just as good and my delivery had the appropriate attitude, it was just as effective without swearing. If you’d like to swear less, but feel that it’s sometimes necessary to create tension, try applying some tenting instead. You might find that it’s even more effective. Merging the two can be extremely powerful if done skilfully. The tenting creates the tension and swearing on the punchline emphasises the balloon pop.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Only swearing once or twice is at its most effective later on in your gig (certainly not at the very beginning), once your audience has got used to you not doing it. Swearing early on in your show indicates to your audience that you’ll be swearing throughout your show. If you only swear once and it’s early on, not only have you failed to maximise the impact of that word, anyone who doesn’t like swearing will be slightly put off, even though you (and only you) know that you won’t be doing it again. So, if you don’t intend to swear again, what have you achieved by only doing it once and early on? Next to nothing, compared to if you’d saved it for the right moment.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you’re unlikely to swear more than twice in one gig and you rarely improvise, here’s how I strongly suggest approaching things:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">A:</b>  Swearing early on / Interaction later on &ndash; <b class="calibre4">Bad</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">B:</b>  Interaction early on / Swearing later on &ndash; <b class="calibre4">Good</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Despite ‘B’ being very simple to achieve, I see so many comedians applying ‘A’. That’s their choice, but that choice is inevitably a result of them not thinking it through. So, when it comes to only swearing once or twice, it’s clearly infinitely more effective if you do it later on, once your audience has got used to the idea of you not swearing. Not only is using one or two swear words far less effective early on in a show, if that comedian also chooses not to interact with their audience until much later on, the fourth wall will only fully come down minutes before the gig has finished. Add that to the second wall that’s appeared between the comedian and anyone who doesn’t like swearing, and there’s quite a lot of invisible stuff in the room that doesn’t need to be there. Interaction early on and swearing later on would make this situation very different.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’m certainly not saying that you should pander to anyone’s taste, especially not someone who might not even be in the room. I’m just saying that, if you plan on only having one or two swear words in an entire show, they really should be well-placed. See the first one as being like having a grenade in your back pocket that’s slowly growing. If you don’t use it at the right moment, you’ve wasted it. Since swearing on a set-up is the least effective way that a comedian can swear, can you imagine how I’d feel if I watched a comedian only swear once in a twenty-minute set and it was on a set-up within their first minute onstage? This is a worst-case scenario, and I don’t want you to ever do it. Even if you’ll be swearing ten times during a twenty-minute set, your <span class="underline">first</span> use of a swear word should still be placed wisely.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Do you remember the very high status comedian who walked onstage and said:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Hello, Comedy Store. How the f#@k are you?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">What I didn’t mention before was that he then proceeded to not swear until around seven minutes into his ten-minute set. Imagine if he’d simply started by saying:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Hello, how the hell are you?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">That may not have quite got the same attitude across, but the material that instantly followed it certainly would’ve done, and using his first swear word seven minutes later on a killer punchline would have more than made up for the lack of swearing in his greeting. In fact, the advantage would have been huge. The one swear word in Rich Hall’s Scrabble song wouldn’t have been a fraction as effective if he’d sworn before he started the song, especially if he’d used the same word.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">What can we take from all this? That every moment onstage is potentially working for or against you and, trust me, if you use those moments to your advantage, they will add up to making a big difference to your show. Some comedians are unknowingly leaking things left, right and centre. A skilful comedian isn’t doing any of those things, because they’re perfectionists who’ve thought everything through. Swear as little or as much as suits your persona, just think it through.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="title-page-contributor-primary-block" id="calibre_link-144">
      <p class="first1">No one could live a full life that didn’t regularly involve anticipation, and storytelling takes full advantage of that fact. I believe that structuring a story is one of the most overlooked techniques in comedy (a close second to flow). One thing I vividly remember learning at school is that a story, no matter how short, has to have a beginning, a middle and an end. I’d also say that the ending should be in the form of a surprise. Personally, I see a story as a two-track recorder. Think of ‘Track 1’ as everything that actually happened which, with the exception of any tangents, is constantly playing. ‘Track 2’ is anything that adds extra detail to the story. In this example, ‘Track 2’ is predominantly a random list of some of those things. So, <span class="underline">don’t</span> make a note of it:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">Track 1:</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Beginning  (situation)  &ndash;  Middle (plot)  &ndash;  End (surprise)</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">Track 2:</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Joke  &ndash;  Joke  &ndash;  Topper  &ndash;  Tangent  &ndash;  Joke  &ndash;  Strongest line</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, the facts in ‘Track 1’ merge with the jokes in ‘Track 2’ to make <span class="underline">one</span> track &ndash; a story with lots of punchlines. Although most of the things in ‘Track 2’ are in a random order, I should draw your attention to the two that aren’t:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Tangents should <span class="underline">not</span> happen very early on in a story</li>
        <li class="calibre6">A story should ideally end on the strongest line</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">We’ll look at both of these things later on. As you know, I see punchlines in my mind’s eye as a combination of balloons and seesaws, and I want you to do the same. However, the only reason I showed you a story as two tracks is to remind you to add jokes to that story. So, feel free to stop seeing stories as two tracks. All I care is that your stories do more than just tell your audience what happened, because that alone isn’t enough.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Your favourite story by another comedian will inevitably involve lots of detail and, in a few minutes, I want you to watch a clip of them performing it (if possible) and look out for the punchlines that are jokes, observations and asides that seamlessly merge with what actually happened. As I’ve mentioned, a very well-structured story often results in the work that went into it going unnoticed.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When you’re very new, telling a funny story as it happened is fine, especially if it’s well-performed. However, that shouldn’t be your ultimate goal. Don’t become a one-track story comedian. Whenever I watch a comedian telling a one-track story, I don’t so much see it as comedy as a collection of copied and pasted funny moments that they just happened to experience. Very well-performed act-outs of the scenes in a one-track story can be a joy to witness, but structure will always take those stories to the next level.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Earlier, I mentioned detail in a set-up being garnish. To me, adding jokes, asides and tangents to a story is the difference between being served a plain burger on a plate without a bun, and a burger with cheese, tomato, lettuce and pickle with ketchup on the side.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">What actually happened to you is the meat, but it’s far from a meal.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When you watch a very skilled comedian telling a story, it may seem like they’re just telling you what happened, but that’s because the merges between facts and thoughts are seamless. Unfortunately, a by-product of comedians applying that much craft is that some comedians think that a good story doesn’t have to involve any structure or artistic input.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I don’t want all this to be intimidating, because it shouldn’t be. If you already have the ‘meat’ you're far from being asked to start again. Even if you’re about to write out a true story for the first time, you won’t find yourself staring at a blank screen. So embrace this, and see it as an exciting project. This is one major advantage that true stories have over jokes &ndash; the ‘meat’.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s have a closer look at merging the story with jokes. Imagine saying:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I went skiing last week’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is purely what happened, and is a standard way to start a story. The thing to remember when it comes to punching up a story is that, as long as you add jokes about the story, they <span class="underline">are</span> the story:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I went skiing last week, which was a mistake because I’m allergic to breaking my neck’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is a merge because it tells the audience what happened as well as a joke about what happened within the same sentence. I see the second half of that line as a slice of pickle, and this is what I always aim for. When an audience listens to a well-structured story, it feels like they’re just hearing a story, and that’s exactly why I believe that comedians shouldn’t ever refer to lines within a story as <i class="calibre3">‘jokes’</i>. Let your audience get lost in the story, because they’re not thinking about set-ups and punchlines the way you are. They’re not comedians, so don’t talk to them like they are.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now would be a good time to watch a clip of your favourite storytelling comedian and, rather than allowing yourself to be swept up by the magic, look out for all the details that appear to be story, but are actually jokes, tangents and thoughts about what happened.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I mentioned that the surprise at the end of a story should ideally be the strongest line, because this really is what we should all be aspiring to achieve. Over the years, I’ve told stories that have been successful, but ended on a small laugh or no surprise (just a positive conclusion). I’m not suggesting that all stories have to end on a huge laugh or a twist, but failing to do either is definitely worth avoiding.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The final punchline of Woody Allen’s ‘Moose’ routine (it’s on YouTube) has got such a twist that it’s the biggest surprise and biggest laugh of the entire story, and that moment felt like I’d been watching a conductor standing in front of an orchestra that was playing a dramatic piece by Mozart. What more could you want?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The most important thing that I want you to take from this is that your stories don’t rely solely on what happened. One-track stories in comedy are a sign that the comedian simply hasn’t bothered to put any thought whatsoever into that story. Quoting funny lines by other people is arguably a cop-out for writing a joke, and I must admit that I’ve done it once in thirty years. My thoughts on doing this are, if you’re going to quote someone else being funny, put the time you didn’t put into coming up with that punchline into adding structure to that story, as well as working out where in your show it will benefit you most.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here are a few thoughts on quoting other people:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Either build a story around the funny line or add structure by first setting the scene</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Add several punchlines to that story / short story</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Increase the tension before the punchline by adding drama</li>
        <li class="calibre6">If that person outwits someone else, give them more incentive to do it (e.g. make the other person even more dislikeable)</li>
        <li class="calibre6">If that person outwits <span class="underline">you</span>, think about the best time in your show for it to happen</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">When it comes to expanding on a line that you or someone else said, it should be quite easy to do, since something must have happened before that funny line was said. If you don’t add any structure to quoting someone else, it could be anyone telling that ‘story’ and we’re back to the funny audience member in Birmingham, just without the boom mic moment. Imagine going to see your favourite singer-songwriter live, and halfway through their concert they pulled a phone out, held it close to the mic and played thirty seconds of someone else singing a song they had nothing to do with. The audience certainly wouldn’t applaud at the end. Yes, the difference between these two situations is that the comedian delivers the line themselves, but without a well-performed act-out or them bothering to create suspense, strong mental images or any extra punchlines, they’ve as good as pulled a phone out of their pocket and pressed ‘play’.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Do you remember the phrase ‘humility credit’? The nice thing about telling a story that ends with someone outwitting you is that, no matter how well-structured the story is or how clever the punchlines are leading up to that moment, you’re still ending on being low status, and that can be very charming if you’ve been high status up until that moment. Personally, I like to lose early on, to show I don’t take myself too seriously. That way my audience is more likely to warm to me when I proceed to win several times in a row.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I don’t mean winning by ending stories with <i class="calibre3">‘and then I said…’</i>. Winning can be as subtle as presenting a clever idea. You might not have a persona that needs to add some humility credit, either because you’re extremely high or extremely low status, but I want you to also think through whatever you do to get the best results from it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The one story I tell where I’m outwitted would work anywhere I do it, because audiences want to laugh and it’s a funny story &ndash; but that’s not enough. I also think about when to do it, which is a subtlety that’s often overlooked by many comedians. Once you fully understand your persona and who wins or loses in your jokes, routines or stories, you’ll know why a certain bit of material is best in a certain place in your show. You may be able to get very good reactions whenever you perform it, and that’s fine &ndash; but knowing where it will work best is yet another difference between good and great.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Okay, it’s finally time to discuss anticipation. Do you remember the weak punchline about having a dog?</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘When I finally got a dog, there was only </i>one<i class="calibre3"> thought that went through my mind and that’s…I wish I hadn’t got a dog’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Isn’t it a beautiful thing that you can create anticipation by simply telling an audience that you had a thought, and then making them wait half a second to find out what that thought was? To reiterate, creating that half a second of anticipation is infinitely more effective than saying:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘When I finally got a dog, I wished I hadn’t got a dog’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">When it comes to telling an actual story onstage, it’s just as easy to create anticipation from the moment you start it, by telling them what happened within the first line. When done well, this is extremely effective because you’re forcing your audience to wait for as long as a few minutes to find out exactly how it happened. Imagine pausing for a second at the end of a routine and saying:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I recently got mugged in Morocco’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is an effective and economical way to start a story, because it hooks your audience from the moment you start it. I don’t see ‘hook’ as an industry term, but to be clear, I mean that &ndash; assuming your audience is already engaged &ndash; they will instantly want to know what happened next. You’ve basically just shown them a very short film trailer with no spoilers. We’ll discuss what to do if your audience isn’t engaged in a few minutes.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Hooks can exist in short jokes as well as stories, and comedians who realise the power of a good hook will apply them wherever possible. The one time I saw Dave Chappelle perform live, he was working on new material. At one point, he did a very short joke about needing to unlock his wife’s phone using facial recognition. He started with the ultimate hook: that he suspected she was having an affair. The punchline that followed was visual and racially controversial, and he got away with it because he’s married to an Asian woman and the audience adored him. However, the point I want to make is that there was no story. It was all over the moment he’d made the controversial joke. So, it was actually a short joke, but he’d hooked us as if it was a story.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Many comedians would have started by saying:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘The other day, I needed to unlock my wife’s phone’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Chappelle created an eight-word trailer before a short joke, and his audience was gripped.  They not only wanted to know if he managed to unlock his wife's phone, they also wanted to know if he caught her cheating. My point is that it wasn’t a story about betrayal, it was a short joke with a strong hook. Even though the joke would’ve worked on its own, Chappelle instantly added drama.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I want you to take from this, because adding hooks to short jokes can make a huge difference when it comes to anticipation. Look how much can happen within three seconds. The antithesis of using words that skilfully is waffle and, whenever I watch two comedians on the same bill and one is using every second to their advantage and the other is waffling, I don’t even consider them to be playing the same game. If all the second comedian hears is the volume of the audience laughter, they probably won’t ever see it that way (despite the laughs that they’re creating being noticeably further apart).</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Years ago, when I used to watch TV, I was flipping channels and stumbled across a documentary about a bodybuilder with ridiculously large arms. I got bored within two minutes but, just as I was reaching for the remote control to change channels, the advert break started and the words <i class="calibre3">The Man Whose Arm Exploded</i> appeared on the screen. I not only sat through the advert break, I watched the entire show. The title of the show was the ending of the show. If it had been called <i class="calibre3">The Man With The Biggest Arms In The World,</i> I wouldn’t have so much as watched the first advert in the break. Imagine what that title did for the ratings of that show, and then think about what your set-ups can do for your shows. Set-ups don’t have to be dull, and that can be avoided by giving them the same amount of attention you give your punchlines.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Sometimes the dramatic part of the story needs to be a surprise, and therefore you mustn’t start the story with that information because that trailer has a spoiler. In this situation you can start by saying something like:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I’ve just got back from Morocco, and it was the worst week of my life’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is clearly a very different type of hook, and is an important decision that you have to make by thinking things through. We’ll talk more about this soon. Personally, I’m not a fan of comedians starting a story with:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I want to tell you a story’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’m not dead against it, I just don’t see much reason for doing it. If you want to compromise between instantly creating drama and announcing that you’re about to tell a story, I suggest easing into that story.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Let’s look at the effects of easing into a story from an audience’s perspective. Imagine telling a friend that you’ve got a sore neck and, rather than them responding by saying <i class="calibre3">‘Would you like a massage?’</i> they instead start to gently rub your neck, which somehow turns into a ten-minute massage that you weren’t expecting. As you probably know, there’s something very pleasant about experiencing that.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Let’s assume your story is about being mugged in Morocco. Here are the stages that I suggest going through to allow you to ease into that story:</p>
      <ol class="calibre7">
        <li value="1" class="calibre6">Ask your audience if any of them have been to Morocco</li>
        <li value="2" class="calibre6">Interact briefly with an audience member about why they went there (ideally resulting in some improv)</li>
        <li value="3" class="calibre6">Mention that when you were there something happened to you</li>
        <li value="4" class="calibre6">Start the story</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="subsq1">This makes it more of a neck rub that turns into a massage because there’s no noticeable moment when the audience realise that you’re about to tell them a story. The lovely thing about ‘2’ is that, since your agenda is to tell a story about Morocco, any interaction with the audience has a safety net under it, because the moment you feel that the interaction isn’t going anywhere, you can start the story. So, this technique not only eases you into the story, you’re under the least pressure possible when it comes to having to be funny when you interact with your audience.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">This is extremely different to asking a question with no agenda. No agenda means no safety net, because a random question will instantly cause your audience to expect something funny to come of that interaction. Asking a question about the subject you’re about to talk about means that any improv is a bonus. Just don’t ask three questions in a row without saying anything funny, or the gig will start to sound like a job interview. Whenever I see a comedian do this more than twice, I start to think about the material that comedian has just deprived their audience of hearing. I’ve been guilty of it myself, but it’s certainly something I’m conscious of avoiding. We all develop bad habits and it’s our job to spot them and improve.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">As you know, I suggested audience interaction purely as a way to ease into a story. However, look at this way of starting a story:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I want to tell you a story. First of all, who here’s been to Morocco?’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">AUDIENCE REACTS.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I’ve just got back from there and it was the worst week of my life. I got mugged’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I hope you can see how pointless this version is. The interaction achieves nothing and we’re ten seconds in before there’s an ounce of anticipation. In print, the flaws are glaringly obvious, but this really is a common approach. It’s so much more effective to simply pause at the end of a routine and then say:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I recently got mugged in Morocco’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">…and then tell the story. How you approach the beginning of a story should feel natural to your style of comedy. There’s nothing relaxed about my style. So, wherever possible, I’ll begin a story with a dramatic hook. Regardless of your style, you really should think through how you approach the beginning of a story.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">We’ve looked at hooking your audience from the start. Although it suits my style to do that, whenever I find myself in front of a rowdy audience, I always ease into a story. Announcing to a rowdy audience that you want to tell them a story can have catastrophic results. Just like a schoolteacher s<i class="calibre3">aying,</i> <i class="calibre3">‘Pay attention, class’</i>, it puts the comedian at risk of facing resistance. Being rowdy is being naughty, and naughty people thrive on rebelling. So, many comedians either choose not to tell a story at a rowdy gig and replace it with something punchier, or take the risk of having their story fail and then go backstage and blame the audience. You don’t have to do either. Skilfully easing into a story at the right moment gets round both these problems, because there isn’t a moment for your audience to decide to rebel against you and this can be achieved by applying steps ‘1’ to ‘4’.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, you’re bringing up the subject of the story you intend telling without mentioning that you’re about to tell a story. I can’t tell you how satisfying it feels to look out at 400 people and spot the silhouettes of fifteen drunk men dressed as Smurfs, all leaning forward in anticipation because they’re dying to find out what happens next. It’s the imagination equivalent to sedating someone, and you mustn’t let your audience notice the moment the needle enters their collective arm. I discovered this technique eight years into doing stand-up, and I hope it helps you to do what you set out to do onstage, rather than either failing or dropping material for a gig.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Whenever I feel that a part of a story lacks drama, emotion or strong mental images, I’ll add a punchline or two to those moments. Thanks to necessity being the mother of invention, we already know that’s easier than it seems. When you next look at one of your stories, I want you to focus on the lulls and write down a list of thoughts you have about what happened during those moments. See if you can either add some nice-sounding words, mental images or write a natural tangent from the story. If you’re going to tangent within a story, my advice is to avoid doing it very early on, because you need your audience to first build up a strong enough mental image of the scene that you’re setting. If you tangent too early on, you’re at risk of your audience forgetting what’s happened in the story when you return to it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Earlier, I mentioned presenting ideas in the form of hypothetical situations. A perfect example of this would be a tangent within a story. Simply pause at the relevant moment within a true story and say something like:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘and it got me thinking…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">You can then present any idea that you had at the time and, once you’ve finished sharing that thought, returning to the true story should work beautifully, because you’re bringing your audience back to reality, having talked about fantasy. Another subtle thing happens when you return to a story from a tangent, and that’s that it forces the story to become a familiar place.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I see this as just like a certain moment that happens to us all on holiday. When you check into a hotel and go to your room, everything around you is new to you. However, when you go out for the day to see more new things and eventually return to your hotel, that same hotel room is suddenly a familiar place. It’s exactly the same for your audience when you return to a story from a tangent. Pausing after a tangent and saying:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘So, anyway. There I was, down a dark alley…’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">…instantly brings your audience back to a familiar place in their minds, which is a strangely satisfying feeling (even if they know you’re about to get mugged). Having the light and shade of a gripping true story, that’s mixed with imaginative hypothetical situations within a tangent, means that you’re taking storytelling way beyond simply telling your audience what happened.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">My tip for creating tangents is to use the list method. Make a list of all your thoughts on the main topics within a story and expand on one.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look at lulls. Imagine the lull happens before the drama, during a story about you not being able to find your moped. I said <i class="calibre3">‘you’</i> because I want you to imagine that this is your material. It might look something like this:</p>
      <ol class="calibre7">
        <li value="1" class="calibre6">Celebrating a friend’s birthday in a bar</li>
        <li value="2" class="calibre6">Walking your drunk friend home</li>
        <li value="3" class="calibre6">Not being able to remember where you parked your moped</li>
        <li value="4" class="calibre6">Eventually finding your moped somewhere else</li>
        <li value="5" class="calibre6">The surprise that explains why your moped ended up there</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="subsq1">Since the drama happens during stages ‘3’ &amp; ‘4’, you’re unlikely to have any lulls during those moments. However, that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t also be funny. As long as you don’t stamp on the necessary tension, there can also be punchlines before and after that tension. Since you can’t tell this story without explaining what you did before you forgot where you parked your moped, these are almost inevitably the stages of the story most likely to need to be punchier. So, it’s worth making a list of all the details that happened during ‘1’ &amp; ‘2’, as well as any thoughts that occurred to you during those stages, and then get writing. There’s absolutely no reason why a factual part of a story can’t be funny, too. So, let’s try to cram a line into a lull during the hypothetical lost moped story. Imagine the lull in the story goes like this:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘It was my friend’s birthday, so we went to a cocktail bar. Since it was Christmas, the place was packed with large office parties’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although both sentences are factual, the second one gives the audience a mental image of lots of office parties. So, I’ll make a list of what occurs to me when I think of office parties. Again, I’ll be doing this step by step:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Bad dancing</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Men who’ve loosened their ties</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Bosses trying too hard to be ‘one of the gang’</li>
        <li class="calibre6">People who don’t seem comfortable around each other</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">The last one sparked a thought (change underlined):</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Since it was Christmas, the place was packed with <span class="underline">groups of people who clearly didn’t like each other</span></i>’.</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This may not be a joke (yet), but it lets the audience know a thought you had about the situation in the bar, as opposed to only telling them what happened. So, since your audience will still picture a bar full of office parties, the fact and thought have merged into one. This is the foundation for creating the difference between simply telling your audience what happened and structuring a story.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now let’s look at that thought, and try to turn it into a joke:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘It was mid-December and, since it was <span class="underline">the season of goodwill to all men</span>, the place was packed with groups of people who clearly didn’t like each other’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Pointing out that irony only took a few extra words, and has turned a mental image needed to set a scene into a joke. There’s no limit to how many times you can do this within one story, as long as you don’t distract your audience too much from what happened. So, as long as the main parts of the plot still stand out (you’ll be able to sense if they don’t), you can keep adding more detail and watch the story grow when you sit down to write it, or over time onstage whenever you perform it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">As an exercise in writing, I want you to imagine that you’re going to tell this story onstage. Your moped was stolen and you eventually found it, dumped by the person who stole it. How would you start this story? You have to make the right decision from asking one of three questions:</p>
      <ol class="calibre7">
        <li value="1" class="calibre6">Do you want your audience to be completely hooked from the start by knowing that your moped was stolen, forcing them to wait to find out exactly what happened?</li>
        <li value="2" class="calibre6">Do you want your audience to have no idea what happened other than that it was an awful experience that happened after you left the bar?</li>
        <li value="3" class="calibre6">Do you want your audience to have no idea what happened, and just start by telling them that you went to a bar for a friend’s birthday party?</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="subsq1">I suggest asking yourself these questions before you decide how you start a story. Since, in this specific case, the moped is found later on, I’d say that means it’s perfect to go with ‘1’, because there’s even more surprise in the second half of the story (finding your moped somewhere else).</p>
      <p class="subsq1">To fully illustrate what these details can achieve, look at these two versions of the start of the same story:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘I want to tell you a story. The other day, I had an awful experience after a friend’s birthday party. Someone stole my moped. A few of us were out celebrating her birthday in a bar and, since it was Christmas, the place was packed with large office parties’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘The other day I had my moped stolen. It was just before Christmas, and I was in a bar celebrating a friend’s birthday. Since it was the season of goodwill to all men, the place was packed with groups of people who clearly didn’t like each other’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The difference between these two approaches is very noticeable, and yet I regularly see comedians using variations of ‘A’. It’s waffle, and wastes time.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Study the difference between ‘A’ &amp; ‘B’ and then imagine twenty to sixty minutes of watching a comedian applying the same lack of thought that went into ‘A’. Over an entire show that really would add up to a lot of time that could have been spent doing more material, as well as adding toppers and boosting any lulls with nicer-sounding words.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Stories can grow organically onstage by simply bringing what happened to the stage, and telling the story again and again until it takes its form over time. If you’re not comfortable with that idea, the good news is that this is far easier to do than trying to create brand-new jokes onstage, because what happened to you acts as a safety net. This is a privilege that jokes don’t have. If a joke isn’t funny when you first do it onstage, there’s no comedy. This huge advantage that stories have over jokes is the main reason that so many comedians depend on what happened to be the comedy.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">In 2002, I got mugged at knifepoint. It wasn’t nice, but the next night I went onstage and told the story as it happened. I only had one funny thought about it to share with the audience; the rest of it was simply me telling the story, which included one funny thing that happened. Since my life had been in danger and the audience cared enough about me, they were gripped. This is another major advantage that stories have over most jokes and why it’s so shrewd to add drama to a joke (e.g. Dave Chappelle unlocking his wife’s phone). However, there were only two laughs within the two-minute story:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">The one funny thing that happened</li>
        <li class="calibre6">The one funny thought I’d had when it happened</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">The rest was just drama (the safety net) created by the situation I was ‘lucky’ enough to have happen to me. Although there were only two punchlines, I took the story onstage at my next ten to twenty gigs and told it again and again, until it organically grew into a structured story crammed with punchlines. If you’re not comfortable improvising onstage, another method would be to type the entire story out verbatim and then read it back, searching hard for where you can add punchlines, tangents, throwaway comments and stronger mental images. If nothing happens, take a break or change your surroundings and then start again. Assuming something happens, go over it again and add a topper.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">No, of course it’s not easy. It’ll be hard work, but the results of that hard work might be the best feeling you’ve had as a comedian all year. Unfortunately, so many comedians’ stories involve them simply telling their audience what happened, only adding one punchline that they thought of themselves (sometimes even adding nothing). So, they’re pretty much relying on the situation they were fortunate enough to happen to them to ‘create’ new material.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If a story doesn’t have a proper surprise at the end, it simply won’t be as satisfying for the audience and, if that surprise is what actually happened, that’s great. When obscure things happen to us in our lives that we take to the stage, they’re gifts. The rest is down to your ability to add structure, add your unique perspective on it, and ultimately make it funnier.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">To this day, I’m glad that I got mugged that night. I didn’t get hurt, they didn’t take much from me, and I got a gripping story out of it. However, it still took twenty to thirty performances for it to become good material.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here’s an example of starting a story completely unannounced. Woody Allen simply paused at the end of a bit and then said:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Um…I shot a moose once’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The audience was gripped. The long pause after <i class="calibre3">‘um’</i> created some anticipation, and the four-syllable sentence that followed was the perfect film trailer without a spoiler. It’s no coincidence that this is perfect when I analyse it. Just like Tim Vine’s nuisance phone call, it has been intelligently thought through, even if that thought process was instinctive.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s a very good reason Woody Allen didn’t start his classic routine with:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I want to tell you a story. I was hunting in upstate New York in the woods the other day, and something weird happened to me’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Nothing much is achieved here and, when I see a comedian start a story like this, it’s clear that they haven’t thought about what will go through their audience’s minds.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now, let’s look at some of the ways that you can start a story:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Hook your audience by saying exactly what happened</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Hook your audience by only letting them know that something unusual happened</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Ease into the story so that your audience doesn’t immediately realise it’s a story</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Say ‘I want to tell you a story’</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Something I find very lazy is when a comedian makes the assumption that, because a story has drama, it’s okay for the ‘laughs per minute’ to drop considerably. Often, I’ll watch a comedian who’s spent ten minutes doing short, punchy routines tell a story and the gig noticeably slows down. They would no doubt justify that to themselves that it’s because it’s personal and therefore more gripping than a joke and, if done well, they’re right. However, why can’t a gripping story also be crammed with punchlines, provided the comedian still allows any suspense to be set up at the right moments?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If a story slows down, but the payoff is huge, that’s fine. If that’s the case, I suggest doing it at the end of your show to avoid there being two sudden gear shifts: down when you start the story, and back up after you’ve finished it. I have one story that’s very poignant, so it feels justified when things slow down because it gets the audience very emotional just before the big surprise. So, that’s two reasons I would always close a show with it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you haven’t started your journey in comedy yet and are planning to tell a story at your first ever gig, don’t put yourself under too much pressure to add extra punchlines. If you’re glimpsing into your future, remember that this is what you should be aiming for. What’s more important for now is that when you’re structuring a story, you ask yourself these questions:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Does it benefit the story to mention what happened at the very beginning or is that information better as a complete surprise later on?</li>
        <li class="calibre6">If there are any lulls, can they at least be trimmed down?</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container">
          <img alt="" width="450" src="images/000036.jpeg" height="424" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">Although there are no rules, I’d say it’s safer to avoid opening your set or even an hour-long show with a story. Unless you’re brought onstage to a hugely receptive audience or have a following of adoring fans, the moment you walk onstage your audience is standing on the shore. So, get them to board the boat with at least one shorter bit before you introduce a story, even if that only takes thirty seconds.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I love it when a comedian’s story is gripping straight away. If it doesn’t suit your style to do that, at least try to make the first minute interesting. Given that a full minute of information that doesn’t involve anything other than facts is capable of becoming dull, try to imagine what that minute would feel like for anyone watching you who might have already lost interest in your show. This is where balls and cubes come in. I’d say that the start of ninety-five percent of stories are cubes. No matter how strong the hook is, it’s extremely unlikely that it will immediately create rolling energy. After all, you’re setting the scene. This is why I can’t imagine Woody Allen ever having this thought process onstage during a tough gig:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">I’ve completely lost them. What material shall I do next?</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Um…I shot a moose once’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Maybe that’s why he always started that story with <i class="calibre3">‘Um’.</i> This hypothetical wrong call is similar to a misplaced cube moment, because the first two punchlines of the story would be wasted. It’s not a crime when that happens, because the lines are part of a story &ndash; it’s just a shame to see good lines not work. Applying craft can happen just as much onstage as offstage and, although I can’t possibly know the amount of changes Woody Allen made before he eventually got to the final version of that story, I have seen two recordings of it and the second version had the following tweaks:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">There were no wasted words</li>
        <li class="calibre6">There were fewer lulls</li>
        <li class="calibre6">He crammed more detail into existing punchlines</li>
        <li class="calibre6">He replaced some words with nicer-sounding ones</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">So, it was great the first time he recorded it, and it still got better. That inspires me, and I hope it does the same to you.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The reason I believe many comedians tend not to put enough care and attention into storytelling is because it’s the most significant parallel between stand-up comedy and being funny in normal life. Even your least funny friend has probably made you laugh telling you about something that happened to them, because the funny thing was a gift and not a thought. So, in the same way that analogies onstage need to be stronger than ones in normal conversation, a story needs to be more thought-out than simply sharing something funny that happened to you. To me, watching a comedian telling a story that lacks artistic input is the equivalent of them following up a bland observation with:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">‘I mean…why would anyone do that? That would be like <b class="calibre4">*insert equivalent situation*</b></i> <i class="calibre3">and </i><b class="calibre4">*<i class="calibre3">insert equivalent behaviour*</i></b><i class="calibre3">’.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">The truth is that you can get away with just telling an audience what happened because, with a combination of charisma, drama and a good atmosphere, something exciting will happen. This is exactly why that same story will often fail in front of a much smaller audience in a half-empty room with no atmosphere: it’s basically being exposed for its lack of content. When a brilliant comedian tells a story, it’s crammed with punchlines, asides, the occasional cute turn of phrase, strong mental images, and their own unique perspective on what’s happened. Imagine how ripped off a hardened comedy fan feels when they watch a comedian tell a story where the only thing that didn’t actually happen is a simplistic analogy about what happened. You might be thinking, <i class="calibre3">‘Not everyone’s a hardened comedy fan’.</i> They’re not, but the outcome of considering them whenever you write your material will be much better than if you write it for the drunk person who looks at their phone every two minutes.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Since everyone is capable of telling a half-funny story and using basic analogies to illustrate a point, surely we owe it to our audiences to make sure that our stories are crammed with content, and that any analogies we use are either astute or have layers to them. I mean, why would anyone <span class="underline">not</span> do that? That would be like <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">*going to a football match*</i></b> and <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">*watching twenty-two people who are unable to kick a ball*</i></b>. In fact, when you look at it that way, is it any wonder that people occasionally decide to join in?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">My performance tip for telling a story onstage is that, whenever you put an image in your audience’s minds of something that happened to you, try to imagine it with them. This will not only force you to be in the moment because there’s a good chance you’re just <i class="calibre3">saying the words</i> as a result of being bored of telling that story so many times, it will also mean that you’re aware of how well you’re painting a picture. If you’re not thinking about the same images that your words are painting, how can you truly know how good your paintings are?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">You might be thinking <i class="calibre3">‘I know, because I thought about it when I first came up with that material’.</i> Maybe, but even if you’ve created a comic masterpiece, you still should never find yourself onstage just saying words. You’re sharing a few memorable minutes of your life and, to do that effectively, your emotions really should match each moment of that story, and that can only truly be achieved if you relive it. So, be present, and you’ll not only sound like you’re saying it for the first time, you’ll enjoy performing it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Earlier, I mentioned how important it is to experience an act-out with your audience to allow the timing to be realistic. Here’s another parallel between comedy and magic that might seem like they’re exact opposites. Alan Alan (my magic mentor) once told me to learn a trick and then forget how it’s done. That way, since the magician appears to be watching real magic, their audience can join them in watching it like it’s real magic. The key word is <i class="calibre3">‘join’.</i> In storytelling, I strongly feel that you have to make sure you relive the story every time you tell it. That way, your emotions will be stronger when you’re telling it, making it more real for your audience. So, although Alan Alan’s advice sounds like the exact opposite to mine, it’s actually identical, because both require you to share your audience’s experience.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I have a question for you. Do you remember me saying these words in the chapter on new material?</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘There’s only one downside to all of this; now that the smoking routine has ended up here, the comedian I’m writing for won’t be able to use it’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">When you read it, did you think to yourself? <i class="calibre3">‘I had that exact thought a few minutes ago’.</i> If you did<i class="calibre3">,</i> then the moment you read that sentence, the best you could possibly have felt was to get a pleasant sense of knowing that you were ahead of me. When that happens in a film plot, we feel superior to the screenwriter, which can result in a sense that we’ve just wasted our time committing to a film that’s not good enough to surprise us. Although my comment about the comedian not being able to use the material I’d just written for her was only an afterthought, it would still be far less satisfying if you’d seen it coming.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Try to see jokes as mini-movies, because your audiences deserve to be fully surprised by them. Just because our audiences only commit to a joke for five to ten seconds (as opposed to up to two hours when they watch a film), it doesn’t mean they won’t be disappointed if they can see where it’s going. If fifty percent of an audience feel smug on a punchline whenever a comedian sets out to pull the rug from under their feet, it’s a fail, even if it results in those people laughing a bit. Be that sniper on a roof.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I want you to think of one of these things:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">An existing story that you already do onstage</li>
        <li class="calibre6">A story that you’re thinking of doing onstage</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Something interesting, dramatic or strange that recently happened to you</li>
        <li class="calibre6">An idea you already have for a made-up story (if it suits your style of comedy)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Now I want you to type out that entire story (unless you already typed it out at the end of the chapter on toppers) and apply everything we’ve just looked at that applies to your style and watch it grow. Sit down and put the work in rather than just absorbing all of the information in this chapter and continuing to read.</p>

      <p class="first1">There’s a ridiculous shared attitude amongst some comedians, and that’s to have contempt for anyone who fully applies themselves. It seems that a lot of people delight in pointing out that they’re more naturally talented than someone whose career is going better than theirs. Given that talent is free, surely it’s what you do with your talent that you have the right to be proud of. So, not applying your God-given talent is the antithesis to an untalented person working hard, and therefore clearly nothing to boast about. This is going to be a very short chapter because I won’t be explaining a single new method.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When you’re either a new comedian or facing a tough audience (and certainly both), it’s understandable that avoiding having a tough gig will be your main objective, but what about when you’re faced with a lovely audience in a great setting? A strength and weakness of mine is that, whenever I’m in a perfect situation onstage, my aim is to storm the gig and leave my audience feeling happy, having had a great time. This does wonders for gaining new fans, good reviews and being rebooked by a club, theatre or comedy festival. However, what about your growth as a comedian? Comedians have to challenge themselves to grow and, to make sure you do that, here’s a list of things to help push yourself whenever you walk onstage to an audience that’s giving off such good vibes that you feel completely comfortable when you get to the mic:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">A new opening line that sums up your persona (tweak an existing line if necessary)</li>
        <li class="calibre6">An opening line about the room or something that’s just happened at the gig</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Improvise your first one to two minutes</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Whenever you’re completely in your comfort zone onstage, try doing one or two of these things (varying them from gig to gig):</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Drop your strongest bit of material (<span class="underline">only</span> for that gig)</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Try out two to three brand-new lines or one routine / story</li>
        <li class="calibre6">If you only swear a bit, don’t swear until the second half of your gig</li>
        <li class="calibre6">If you swear a lot, only swear on the punchlines</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Close with a bit of material that you haven’t closed with before</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">I want you to take a photo of that list because it’s very useful. Assuming that you’re more than six months into doing stand-up and assuming you don’t face a run of tough gigs, I can’t think of a single reason not to glance at it before you go onstage at least once every two weeks. If you’re very new to stand-up, don’t put yourself under pressure to do this now, but this is definitely what you should be aspiring to be doing soon. To be clear, I’m not suggesting that you permanently drop any material, just that you occasionally create a situation where you don’t rely on your strongest stuff. Regularly applying all of these things to your stand-up can genuinely make the difference between becoming an outstanding comedian, and not growing at all. I learned this the hard way.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There was a time in my career when I rested on my laurels, which is a very dangerous situation for any creative person to choose to put themselves in. Having a newish bit of material that you feel is tweaked to perfection can lead to you dining out on that material and, before you know it, it’s old material and you’ve forgotten to push yourself to generate more new material. Just like finding the balance between a joke being succinct and having lovely details, it’s important to find the balance between making an impact with your existing material and taking a risk on trying new stuff. Knowing exactly when to do this is also important, which is why I mentioned being in your comfort zone.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’ve seen comedians trying out brand-new material while struggling to close a late show, having followed someone who’s just had an incredible gig. I find this attitude so self-indulgent that it’s disrespectful to their audience. By all means refuse to compromise artistically, but doing new material is a risk and so is a tough gig. So, to me, combining the two is selfish. Be an artist &ndash; just one who acknowledges the cost of tickets, cabs and babysitters.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Did you remember to take a photo of that list? If we ever meet, the first thing I’m going to do is ask to see the photos on your phone. It had better be in your ‘Favourites’.</p>

      <p class="first1">So, that’s everything I know. I’ve had a lot of fun, and I hope I didn’t miss out too many <i class="calibre3">‘You</i> <i class="calibre3">might be thinking’</i> moments.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">During the time I wrote this, I was performing stand-up three to five nights a week. As a result, I suddenly became hyperaware of my own methods and theories. I’d occasionally hit a punchline and realise that the flow leading up to it wasn’t quite right, I’d noticed that a collection of words in a set-up could have sounded nicer, and I once spotted a boom mic moment during a vulnerable part of a true story. Whenever this happened, I would tweak the line.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, as much as this might seem like a humble-brag, since we’re all capable of forgetting things we know, I’ve benefited from my own theories.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I recently had a chat with one of the comedians whom I’d asked to look at this book, and asked if they’d finished it. Their reply was, <i class="calibre3">‘I’ve read it twice’.</i> This made me so happy, because they had twenty-six years’ experience in comedy and yet wanted to absorb everything a second time. I can’t force you to read it again, but I would suggest that you at least look at the chapter titles at some point and check that you instantly recall what you learned from each of them. If very little springs to mind, reread those chapters.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’ve worked very hard to explain my methods and theories as clearly as possible. However, if you want to get in touch with me to ask any questions, here’s my email address: <i class="calibre3">adambloom.ga@gmail.com</i>.

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="title-page-contributor-primary-block" id="calibre_link-152">
      <p class="first1">The reason this is a bonus chapter is because all the other chapters are about writing and performing stand-up, whereas this is purely about improving your chances of succeeding when you perform at a private event. Although the main focus will be on performing stand-up in a corporate environment, most of the advice I’m about to give you will also be helpful if you’re planning on giving a presentation, or doing any type of speech.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you’re not already at the stage where you’re performing at corporate events, the opportunities will probably come soon after being a part-time comedian, and my aim here is to fast-track you to being good enough at doing them to get booked to do more of them. You can eventually earn as much as twenty times the amount you get paid in a club, and this will only happen by constantly doing well at private events and it leading to more work &ndash; either from clients, other people at the events, or the booker who got you the gig due to them receiving good feedback.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I would strongly advise you to hold back on performing at any private event until you’re comfortable onstage in a club or theatre, but that’s your call. I certainly don't want to talk you out of doing a gig that could solve your financial problems overnight. A few comedians who earn their living in clubs, but also do the occasional corporate, earn up to twice as much as the ones who only make their living as part of a line-up in clubs and theatres. So, although there will soon be moments when I sound so cynical that you’ll wonder if a different person is talking, there’s the potential for an extremely positive outcome to this.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’ve talked about the difference between a performer and an artist. The reality is that the average corporate event doesn’t lend itself to you being an artist. The lighting and sound can be bad, and the audience can be sat at huge round tables that are far apart in a very large room. The client might have insisted that you wear an outfit that doesn’t suit your persona, has insisted that you don’t swear, and has given you a list of topics not to mention onstage.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s an incredibly rewarding feeling walking away from a corporate event having just had a great gig, especially when you came fully prepared, knowing that doing your homework was a big part of the reason it went well. However, when they’re tough, they’re a new level of tough &ndash; and I’ve learned so many things the hard way that, by sharing them with you, I believe they will significantly increase your chances of having a good gig in a corporate environment.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">In fact, finding yourself in a situation where you feel the need to apply several of my techniques could make the difference between you doing an entire gig to polite chuckles and being the highlight of an event. That might seem like an exaggeration, but if you can make a few subtle changes to how a gig is set up as well as how you approach your performance, the difference can be immense. So, here are my tips for performing at a corporate event or private party:</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first1"><b class="calibre4"><span class="underline">Always</span> Speak to The Client on The Phone</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">No matter what type of private event you’re about to perform at, always insist on speaking to the client on the phone for around fifteen minutes, a few days before the event. Never try to do this on the day of the event as they’ll inevitably be extremely busy, and might not have time for you. Talking to the client not only helps to create a potentially vital bond between you both (we’ll look at exactly why that’s important in a few minutes), you can also check several ‘dos and don’ts’ with them. Here’s the checklist that I mentioned, and I suggest that you have this in front of you the next time you make that phone call:</p>
      <ol class="calibre7">
        <li value="1" class="calibre6">What is the dress code, and is there a type of outfit you’d prefer me to wear?</li>
        <li value="2" class="calibre6">Is there some inside information about your company’s last twelve months that you’re prepared to share with me, that I can talk about onstage?</li>
        <li value="3" class="calibre6">What are the boss’s flaws, and is it okay to make jokes about them onstage?</li>
        <li value="4" class="calibre6">Do your guests know that there’s going to be a comedian performing at the event?</li>
        <li value="5" class="calibre6">Can I send you a link to a clip of me doing stand-up to forward to your guests?</li>
        <li value="6" class="calibre6">Who will be introducing me, and can I email you my introduction to send to them?</li>
        <li value="7" class="calibre6">Will everyone in the audience know each other personally?</li>
        <li value="8" class="calibre6">Is there going to be anyone in the audience who you’d rather I didn’t speak to?</li>
        <li value="9" class="calibre6">Has anything significant happened recently within your company that I should know about?</li>
        <li value="10" class="calibre6">Is swearing okay? If so, are there any words you’d like me to avoid, and would you like to put a limit on how many times I swear during my show?</li>
        <li value="11" class="calibre6">Are there any topics you don’t want me to mention?</li>
        <li value="12" class="calibre6">Can you speak to the venue about the lighting, a choice of microphones and a mic stand?</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="subsq1">Add any questions of your own. If you don’t have any yet, once you’ve finished reading this chapter, try to come up with one or two that might work for your persona. I actually have a thirteenth question that’s specific to my persona that we’ll look at in a few minutes, and I hope it inspires you to come up with some of your own.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I strongly suggest that you ask the client all of the questions on that list (missing out the ones that don’t apply to your style of comedy) and make notes based on their answers. Compromising what you do for a private event is mainly about earning good money, and partly about taking on the challenge of succeeding in a much tougher environment than you’re used to working in. However, if this is already something you don’t like the idea of, there’s a way of not compromising and that’s to only accept the private gigs that allow you to do exactly what you do, and in the type of outfit you usually wear. This will probably mean getting offered fewer gigs and also risking facing the consequences when the client has misjudged their audience. However, if you turn up doing exactly what they booked you to do and it doesn’t go well, that’s not really your problem. Just be prepared to have some tough gigs. It’s only your problem when you go back on an agreement (e.g. swearing onstage when you agreed that you wouldn’t). Personally, I accept most of the private gigs that I’m offered and adjust to fit. These are only ever small adjustments, since the client has usually booked me based on seeing a clip of me doing stand-up.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I cringe when I look back at my first few years of turning up at private events having not spoken to the client or done an ounce of preparation. I’d occasionally have a great gig. However, looking back at some of them it feels like I crossed a busy street blindfolded, wearing earplugs, and somehow managed to get to the other side without being hit.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here are my reasons for asking those twelve questions:</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first1"><b class="calibre4">1 - What to Wear</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although it’s possible that the client will request that you join them in wearing a dinner suit or evening dress, they’re often happy for you not to follow the dress code. In this case, I strongly suggest that you at least turn up looking quite smart. Although it’s great not to have your outfit dictated to you, performing in jeans and a T-shirt in this environment simply doesn’t look right. If you’re a character comedian, then that’s possibly different as some outfits won’t work if you smarten up (e.g. a roadie at a rock concert). If this is the case, explain this to the client on the phone. If you’re not a character comedian, but have a specific outfit to fit your persona, it’s sometimes possible to compromise with a slightly smarter version of it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If the client requests that you wear a dinner suit or evening dress and you don’t own one, buy one. If things go to plan here, the same situation will come up again. You can buy cheap, machine-washable dinner suits that won’t stand out as cheap in a sea of people wearing them. I’m told the same also applies to evening dresses. A cheap outfit will only start to look cheap if you wear it several times and, if this situation arises, that means you’re doing something right, and it’s time to buy a better one. The good news is that stage outfits that you only wear onstage count as a business expense (certainly in the UK). I’d say I’ve performed at around 250 private events and have only been asked to wear a dinner suit four times.</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first1"><b class="calibre4">2 &amp; 3 - Opening Lines</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I mentioned asking for information about the boss and inside information about the company’s last twelve months. If you open with a line that you clearly wrote for the event, even if it isn’t greeted with a huge laugh, it shows that you’ve done your research and that shows commitment. My mum used to manage a shop, and once had to interview several people for a Saturday job. The person she gave the job to was a nineteen-year-old man who was very well-mannered. However, what sealed it for him was that my mum could see he had his ear pierced and had taken the earring out, probably to make a good impression. My mum didn’t have a problem with men who wore earrings. In fact, you might have noticed from an earlier photo in this book that I wore one when I was seven years old (which was very unusual for a boy in the Seventies), but she liked the fact that he’d taken it out as a mark of respect.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’ve had several tepid corporate gigs where I’ve opened with three bespoke lines about the company, and my audience clearly warmed to me more than they did to my material. Add the fact that the boss knew that I had taken the time to chat to them on the phone the day before, and suddenly an average gig seems a lot better in their eyes.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Although the ultimate outcome is an amazing gig, your main goal should be not to mess up. So, aim lower and focus on not offending, and certainly on not going back on your agreement with the client about content. No one tries to get out of paying a comedian because they were <i class="calibre3">‘quite funny’,</i> and they certainly can’t suggest that you turned up not caring if you’ve clearly spent time preparing for the show. A killer opening line about the company you’re performing for is even more powerful than a killer topical joke in a comedy club, because it’s specifically about <span class="underline">their</span> world and that’s as topical as you can possibly get.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Earlier, I mentioned having a bespoke question:</p>
      <p class="subsq1">13. What’s the name of the cockiest person in your company?</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The beauty about asking this is that I then have a grenade in my pocket that I might be able to use.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">During my show at one event, having previously asked the client that question, a young man stood up to go to the bar. Rather than being discreet so as not to draw attention to himself, he proudly stood up and swaggered the entire way from his seat to the door. I said, <i class="calibre3">‘Hello, what’s your name?’ </i>He confidently replied, <i class="calibre3">‘Steve’</i>,<i class="calibre3"> </i>which happened to be the same name as the person I’d been told was the cockiest person in the company. I said, <i class="calibre3">‘Steve Smith?' </i>He looked confused and replied, <i class="calibre3">‘Yeah, how do you know?’</i> I replied, <i class="calibre3">‘I asked your boss who the biggest prick in the company was, and he said you’.</i> It was brutal, and the audience roared with laughter. There was no way that I could have remembered seventy-five names, so there was clearly at least some truth in my comment. I certainly got lucky, but you make your own luck. Also, by being cocky, he was far more likely to do something to make himself stand out.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, rather than swimming against the tide, the key is to look at all the things at any particular private event that you wouldn’t be able to do in a club or theatre, and make them work for you. Once you start to focus on taking advantage of the many factors that make a private event very different to a show in a club or theatre, you’ll often find yourself on your way home from a corporate event wishing that comedy clubs were full of people who know each other, or work within the same industry. Although it’s very common for a comedian to arrive at a private event having not chatted with the client and have an amazing gig by treating it like any other gig and improvising with their front row until they strike gold, it’s still far more likely that things will go well if you at least do some of the research needed to make sure that you avoid the pitfalls.</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first1"><b class="calibre4">4 &amp; 5 - Preparing Your Audience</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">If the audience doesn’t know that there’s going to be a comedian (clients often like it to be a surprise), politely explain that a complete surprise simply doesn’t work, because it puts audiences in a ‘rabbit caught in the headlights’ situation. Instead, request a compromise where the host mentions you during their welcome speech. If there isn’t going to be a welcome speech, insist that the word is spread around the room at the start of the evening. This is very effective, and the word gets around surprisingly quickly.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s extremely important  that your audience know in advance that you’ll be performing stand-up, because I’ve had a significantly lower success rate when I’ve been thrown at an audience who had no idea that they were about to watch a comedian.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When you book tickets to go to a live event, you find yourself counting the days (and certainly the hours) until the event starts. A corporate audience is only counting down to the event itself, and it’s your job to make sure that they’re also looking forward to your section of that event.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">It can be extremely effective to politely ask the client to send an email to all their staff mentioning you by name, along with a link to a clip of you doing stand-up. This means that you’ll already be known to your audience the moment you walk onstage; just make sure you don’t repeat any of the material from that clip. You might be thinking <i class="calibre3">‘I don’t have enough material to do that’. </i>In that case, just ask them to send everyone a photo of you, a short bio, and a note saying that you’re looking forward to performing at their event (if it suits your persona to say that). If you have a very limited amount of material for now, I would suggest making sure that not all of that material is available online, because it will potentially create the same problem when you perform at a club, theatre or festival. <b class="calibre4">An audience knowing in advance that you’ll be performing, and recognising you when you walk onstage, will make your chances of succeeding in a tough environment <span class="underline">infinitely</span> better than if they find out that ‘a comedian’ will be performing, seconds before you appear onstage. </b>That last sentence is worth its weight in gold (giving me two reasons to write it in bold). Given how fragile stand-up can be, context is everything, and there’s nothing more awkward than watching 200 people being forced to stop laughing during their own conversations, so that they can then not laugh at a comedian. It’s your job to prevent that from happening, with a combination of research and communication.</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first1"><b class="calibre4">6 - Your Introduction</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">For some reason people seem to think it’s okay to insult a guest comedian at a private event when introducing them. I suppose because we make jokes, they feel it’s okay to undermine us. This is possibly an alpha-male thing, as I’ve only had men do it to me. I once had this exact introduction:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘Our guest tonight is a comedian who’s had his own series on Radio 4, but is Radio 4 funny? You tell me. Please welcome Adam Bloom’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">What he’d just done was not only undermine me, he’d also inadvertently insulted his staff. It was their annual party and he as good as told them that he hasn’t bothered to spend money on good entertainment. So, that was a pretty stupid thing to do.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">At my very next corporate gig, I asked the person introducing me what they were going to say about me in my introduction. He replied:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">“I’m going to say that we’ve had a really tough year and that you’re all we could afford”.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I bluntly explained that that wasn’t what he was going to say, and then told him the exact introduction I wanted him to give me. If you take control, you’re instantly perceived as having authority. You’re not staff, they are &ndash; and, even if you’re talking to the boss, they’re not <span class="underline">your</span> boss. As of that day, I’ve always emailed the client in advance and told them exactly what I want them to say when they introduce me. I also point out that it’s important that nothing else is said about me either side of that introduction. That last part might seem bossy, but I’ve had a few people put their own spin on my introduction and ruin it. One man (of course it was a man) read out a very nice quote about me from a well-known comedian and then followed it up with:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘So, let’s hope he can live up to that’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Suddenly, a sentence that was designed purely to create anticipation created doubt.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s a nice by-product of having the client’s email address and that’s, if your show goes well, you can email them a few days after the event to ask if they’re happy to give you a referral.  Don’t do it the day after the event, as they’ll probably have had a late night and might forget to reply. Having a list of client feedback for your bio or a corporate agent’s website is incredibly helpful when it comes to getting more corporate work. It’s a slow process getting regular corporate gigs, and I strongly recommend feeling comfortable in a club setting before accepting your first one. Saying that, if they offer you a fortune, do it. At worst, you can spend half your fee on therapy.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If a client says it’s okay for you to swear or be edgy, I suggest asking the person who’ll be introducing you to specifically mention that fact in your introduction. This prevents anyone from recoiling when it happens because, if your audience knows that their boss has okayed edgy content, no one will worry that you’ve crossed a line when you do it. Look at these two situations:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">A &ndash;  ‘What I didn’t tell you was that we’ve booked a comedian for this event. God knows if they’re any good. Please welcome ____ ______’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">COMEDIAN WALKS ONSTAGE TO TEPID APPLAUSE AND OPENS WITH AN EDGY LINE THAT’S GREETED WITH A SMALL LAUGH THAT INSTANTLY CREATES AN AWKWARD ATMOSPHERE.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’ve been in this situation many times. Now look at this one:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">B &ndash;  ‘As you all know, we’ve booked a comedian for this event who’s just got back from a sell-out run at the Edinburgh Festival. If you watched the clip that I sent out, you’ll know some of it was a bit edgy, and I’ve told them they can be as edgy as they want tonight. Please welcome ____ ______’</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">COMEDIAN WALKS ONSTAGE TO LOUD APPLAUSE, OPENS WITH TWO BESPOKE LINES THAT ARE GREETED WITH BIG LAUGHS AND THE AUDIENCE WARMS TO THEM.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I can assure you that ‘A’ is not fun, and yet look how little effort it takes to create ‘B’. Don’t overlook this point. The outcome is you being ten times as likely to have a good gig as if you hadn’t done these three things:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Had a phone call with the client</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Sent one email to the client</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Spent thirty minutes writing some bespoke material</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Not only does ‘A’ often result in an average-to-poor gig, it almost inevitably won’t lead to repeat work. I’d say that only thirty percent of the bespoke opening lines I’ve written for private events were extremely strong. However, I’d still rather open with an average bespoke line than a far stronger generic line. If there’s ever a situation to see the start of a gig as being like a boat trip and the audience is a group of people standing on the shore, it’s a private event. This is because only one member of your audience suggested booking a comedian. So, don’t underestimate the power of a bespoke opening line. You might be thinking <i class="calibre3">‘I can’t write two jokes in an hour’. </i>Then sit down for two hours and write one.</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first1"><b class="calibre4">7, 8 &amp; 9 - Knowing Your Audience</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s very important to find out if your audience already know each other, and I always breathe a sigh of relief when I find out that they do. First of all, lines like the ‘Steve Smith’ one won’t be a fraction as effective if only a handful of the audience know him. However, the major advantage is that audiences are generally far more relaxed if they know each other. If they’re surrounded by near to complete strangers, it can often be a much harder environment for comedy at first, because people often take offence on each other’s behalf the moment they hear something they think might offend someone else. As a result, they often don’t let their hair down, which creates a far more delicate situation for comedy and it’s your job to lure them into forgetting where they are.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, if you arrive knowing that the majority of your audience don’t know each other, there’s no reason why you can’t have a great gig &ndash; just be aware that they might be slightly apprehensive. They might be pumped up and excited to see you, having bonded with each other over an entire afternoon playing golf. However, if you sense that your audience is apprehensive, imagine yourself being them, about to watch you, and approach the start of your gig accordingly.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Here are a few suggestions for when you find yourself in that situation:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">If you swear, hold back on any swearing until you’ve got everyone onboard</li>
        <li class="calibre6">If your comedy is loud or intense, start off by being slightly quieter or calmer</li>
        <li class="calibre6">If you intend to interact with your audience, open with a short monologue rather than interacting with them straight away</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="inline-image1">
        <div class="inline-image-container2">
          <img alt="" width="600" src="images/000038.jpeg" height="299" class="calibre1" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq1">Asking the client if there’ll be anyone in the audience who they’d rather I didn’t speak to is a question I wish I’d started asking a decade before it occurred to me. When I was new to performing at corporate events, I’d sometimes start chatting to someone at the front table and the rest of the audience would freeze. This inevitably meant that that person was either a company director who takes themselves seriously, or a very important client of theirs. They were terrified that I was going to offend that person and, if they were a client, even affect their future business with them.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Unlike in a club or theatre, talking to random audience members at a corporate event can be a minefield, and simply asking if there’s anyone to avoid talking to is like having a metal detector on you. I learned this the hard way, and I can assure you that it’s not fun to watch 200 people seize up and it then take five minutes to reset the room, having just spent ten minutes getting everyone onboard.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The reason it’s important to ask if anything significant has recently happened within the company is because you might face an audience whose boss has recently died, and the client didn’t think to tell you on the phone or at the event. You can act accordingly by not only avoiding the topic in question, but also by treating the audience with more care. If there’s any reason that your audience might be slightly reluctant to be as receptive as the room would suggest, it’s very good to know that in advance, and asking the client could be the only way you’re going to find out.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Look at the profound difference between making fun of Steve Smith and causing my audience to freeze because I’ve just made fun of the CEO of another company who doesn’t have a sense of humour, and it only takes two minutes to get the necessary information to prevent the second situation from ever happening. In fact, ten to fifteen minutes of research can make the difference between feeling like you’re at a rock concert and in a library.</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">10 &amp; 11 - Protecting Yourself</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">When I email the client my introduction and link to a clip of me, I also ask them to remind me of their list of specific requests (e.g. topics not to talk about onstage). However, what I’m actually doing is making sure that I have it all in writing, just in case they change their attitude towards it after the gig. This is something that has happened to me a couple of times because the person who I spoke to on the phone a few days before the gig can be worried that they’re going to be blamed for your gig not going well. Suddenly:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">“Feel free to swear”.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">becomes:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">“He swore too much”.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">and:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">“Talk about whatever topics you want”.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><i class="calibre3">becomes:</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">“He was too edgy”.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">However, if your gig goes well, that person will no doubt be boasting that they were the one who gave you permission to say whatever you wanted. To quote Bob Dylan’s <i class="calibre3">Positively 4th Street</i>:<i class="calibre3"> ‘You just want to be on the side that’s winning’.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq1">It’s also a good idea to record your gig (audio is fine). I’ve had a few corporate clients complain to my agent after I’ve had a tough gig at their event, and they’ve misquoted something I’ve said onstage or quoted it grossly out of context. A perfect example of the second is me responding to a heckle and the client only quoting my response, making it seem like I said it to the entire audience unprovoked, as opposed to in response to one person who’d just been abusive towards me. Having a recording of your gig solves both of these problems.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I should add that I once performed an entire gig using the DJ’s inadequate mic and PA in a room with an extremely high ceiling. The combination of bad sound and poor acoustics meant that the audience could barely hear me. I knew this, because I couldn’t understand a word that the person who was introducing me had said. If I’d turned up before my audience had arrived, there might have been a way to solve this huge problem and if I’d recorded my gig, there certainly wouldn’t have been a debate the next day as to who was to blame.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If a room seems unplayable visually, take a photo of the problem before you go on. Let’s say the sound and lighting are good, but there’s a huge gulf between the stage and the front table (often due to there being a large dance floor that needs to be kept clear); it's good to be able to send a photo to the person who booked you, assuming they’re not already at the event. It’s also a good idea to politely and assertively explain this problem to the client before you go onstage, gaining their empathy, having previously bonded with them on the phone. If there’s talking during the host’s welcome speech, record some of it on video. If the guests are rude or drunk enough to ignore their host, that’s a definite sign that you’re going to have them talking during your gig. This doesn’t necessarily mean  that you’re also going to be ignored, because you’ll no doubt have skills that the host won’t have, but it’s obviously not a good sign. By filming some of the host’s welcome speech, you can prove that being ignored had nothing to do with your ability as a comedian.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’ll often look around the room and make a decision minutes before I go onstage to not swear at all, despite being told that I can swear as much as I like. This is because one person’s opinion on what the attitude to swearing of 200 people is going to be can be very wrong, and you’re the one who has to face the consequences of that bad decision. So, momentarily put yourself in the minds of your audience in a completely new way. The person who you spoke to on the phone might have said that any content is fine, but what happens when you turn up and the CEO’s family are there, which includes their children? The person who spoke to you on the phone days beforehand isn’t thinking about that conversation as it was days ago; they’re now thinking about a dozen other things. So, if this situation will affect your style of comedy, it’s for you to make the decision how to deal with it, and there’s no right answer. Here are a few options:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Drop any inappropriate material and mention at the beginning that it’ll be a clean show</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Mention that there are children in the audience at the beginning of your gig and explain that their parents are okay with you doing ‘adult content’ (having checked that they <span class="underline">are</span> okay)</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Request that the children are taken to another room during your performance</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">The problem created by not acknowledging that there are children in the audience is that the people sitting near them will wonder if you’ve spotted them and, even if you’ve planned to do a clean show, they’ll spend your entire set worrying that you’re about to say something inappropriate. So, I strongly suggest that, regardless of how you’re going to approach your gig, you either acknowledge the children in a way that suits your persona, or ask the person who’ll be introducing you to do it. You can actually have a lot of fun bringing the children into your gig if you’re the type of comedian who interacts with their audience. Again, don’t swim against the tide, surf on it.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I once watched a street performer in Covent Garden make a very rude innuendo in front of a large crowd that contained a few children, and I cringed so hard that I couldn’t enjoy the next few minutes of their show. Imagine that you’ve just had exactly that effect on someone and then add the fact that they’re struggling to hear you. Now add the fact that your performance has interrupted a chat they were having with a potential new client who might have been about to get them a significant amount of new business.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When you look at it that way, it’s not the best time to have contempt for that person for not laughing at a cube that’s following low energy. It’s their night out, not yours, and you’ve taken on a job for money rather than the love of the art form. I’m certainly not suggesting that you learn to juggle or breathe fire. Meet me halfway and, if you find yourself looking out at 300 people and a third of them are sitting with their backs to you, don’t tell a six-minute story ending on a callback to your opening line that probably wasn’t even heard by half your audience.</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4">12 - Sound and Lighting</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">Bad sound is the number one enemy of the comedian, and, at a private event, is generally a problem that you won’t be faced with until the last minute. So, what can you do to improve your odds of not finding yourself performing to an audience who can’t hear you? Ask what time the audience will arrive in the room and ask to meet the person controlling the sound twenty minutes before the audience arrives, so that you can do a sound-check. Assuming the sound is good, make sure that it’s twenty percent louder than you want it to be, because bodies soak up some of that sound, so you have to allow for that.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I mentioned asking the client if they can speak to the venue about the choice of microphones. If the venue is planning to give you a radio mic, request that they have a wired mic as back-up. That won’t guarantee you a choice of mics as they might only have one available, but asking will certainly increase your chances of having a second option. Explain to the client that radio mics have a twenty-five percent chance of cutting out at some point, and tell them to contact the venue directly and insist that someone puts brand-new batteries in the mic that you’ll be using, and confirms with them on the day of the event that it’s been done. The truth is that the client is dealing with a hundred other things and, only when you put the fear in them that something like this can make or break your part of the event will they so much as consider these details.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I remember performing to 500 people in a Park Lane hotel with a radio mic that kept cutting out. The client had probably spent around £50,000 on the event and their guests missed every fourth punchline in my show. A chain is as strong as the weakest link, and someone forgetting to change one battery prevented 500 people from fully enjoying themselves for twenty-five minutes of their evening. So, take charge because, even though it’s not your fault, you’re the one who has to deal with the bad situation.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">What if the acoustics of the room don’t allow clear sound, such as there being a slight echo, plus the sound system isn’t good? My advice here is to get them to turn the volume down slightly, and for you to hold the mic six inches away from your mouth and instead project your voice. What then happens is that the audience is hearing your actual voice with almost no electric amplification and, as a result, it’ll be clearer. This works with poor acoustics, but is especially effective with a bad sound system. Explain this to the client, and point out that it’s not ideal but that you’ll be doing your best. If you’re booked to do thirty minutes, explain that it might only end up being twenty-five minutes because of the strain on your voice. This isn’t so much about not straining your voice as giving you an ‘out’ if the gig turns out to be tough.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Completely aborting the mic is only a good idea if there are fewer than thirty people in the room and there’s no background noise whatsoever, such as the clinking of cutlery. If you make the decision to be in this situation, explain it to the client who’ll appreciate that you’re trying to help make the event go well, and insist that you’re brought on after the tea and coffee is served. It’s fine to perform while they’re drinking tea and coffee, just not when it’s being served.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you’ve opted to perform without a mic due to bad circumstances and there’s a bar in the room, insist that no drinks are made during the time that you’re onstage. Ice makes a lot of noise, and if that’s the only other sound in the room apart from your voice, it can be a major distraction. Even if you do use a mic, if there’s a bar in the room that you’ll be performing in, explain that no blended cocktails are to be made when you’re onstage. If you don’t see the organisers explain this to the bar staff, do it yourself. You have to take control. So, just like with your introduction, don’t ask them to do these things &ndash; tell them.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Lighting is the most overlooked detail when it comes to booking a comedian for a private event. Although a lot of the corporate events I’ve performed at have involved a contract that mentions <i class="calibre3">‘quality sound and lighting’</i>, I’d say only twenty percent of them actually bothered to hire lighting equipment. They take one look at the venue, which is usually a function-room in a hotel, and think <i class="calibre3">‘Well, there are lights on the ceiling. They’ll do’.</i> They won’t, because ceiling lights don’t light up your face. However, it’ll have to do.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">In this situation, you’re faced with two choices: either stand in a fully lit room with no atmosphere, or a dimly lit room with at least some atmosphere, but very little lighting on your face. When you have your mandatory chat with the person who booked you (who is usually an employee and not the boss), explain that good lighting is very important. If it’s in the contract for them to provide it, politely remind them of that, having explained its importance. If it’s not in the contract or they just didn’t bother getting lighting, as soon as you arrive at the venue and realise the lighting isn’t ideal, politely point that out to the client and then introduce yourself to a member of the waiting staff and ask to speak to their manager. Ask them to show you all of your options for lighting. There’s often a selection of dimmer switches slightly hidden away, and you can play around with them to make the best of a bad situation. You want low light on the audience and as much light on you as possible.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Once you’ve found your best option, put the lighting back to how the audience have been used to it being  until you arrived, and only change the lighting to how it will be for your gig five to six minutes before you’re introduced. This creates a mood change and therefore anticipation. However, doing it seconds before your show can create a weird vibe in the room that isn’t good to immediately follow. So, allow the lighting change to let your audience know that something is about to happen, but give them time to adjust to that change.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Even in situations where the venue has a stage and spotlight, there’s often a huge dance floor between the stage and the front row. Personally, I can’t stand being in that situation. I’ll usually abort using the stage to stand closer to my audience. However, this often creates a Catch-22, because the lighting is only set up to light up the stage and can’t be adjusted. In this case, you’re faced with two choices:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Stand close to your audience, but at floor level and in low light</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Stand far away from your audience, but high up and well-lit</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">When this happens, you have to weigh up the pros and cons based on which best suits your style of comedy. For example, someone who very much performs an A-to-Z set and doesn’t interact might be better off on a stage that’s far away and well-lit, whereas someone who interacts a lot with their audience and forms a genuine bond with them would possibly be better off standing closer to them, despite being at floor level and in lower light.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s actually a third option. Two comedians I know invested in basic LED lighting and a tripod. They’re small, light, inexpensive, and will easily fit in the boot of a car. Although they have to be set up close to the performance area and are only effective in small rooms, they can make a huge difference and also show commitment on your part. I feel slightly stupid telling you this, as I haven’t done the same.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">One of those two comedians also keeps a mic stand in the boot of their car (they fold away quite small), because it offers them the privilege of using both hands onstage if the client hasn’t provided a mic stand, which I’d say only happens fifty percent of the time. This isn’t a problem for me. However, if you need to use both hands onstage (or it suits your persona to perform with the mic in the stand) then, unless you mention it on the phone to the client, it won’t occur to them that you might need to use both hands when you perform. Some radio mics are too big to fit in a standard mic stand. So, bringing your own stand doesn’t always solve this problem.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">The alternative is to explain on the phone that you can’t perform without a mic and stand and then stress that it’s vital that they’re compatible. Although my philosophy is to give audiences credit for being intelligent, I’d say the exact opposite applies when it comes to stating your requirements at a private event. Not only will your host have a hundred other things to think about, your needs are very rarely considered because they won’t know what those needs are unless you tell them.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, those are my reasons for asking those twelve questions and, very often, asking just two of them can result in you having a good gig when you otherwise would have faced two major hurdles.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There’s one more thing to discuss in advance with the client and this only applies to a specific situation:</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first1"><b class="calibre4">Remembering / Pronouncing People’s Names</b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you find yourself in a situation where you’re asked to mention people by name onstage, such as handing out an award or passing the mic to another person at the end of your show, I strongly suggest that you ask the client to say those names out to you over the phone, so that you can write them down phonetically. Even better, ask for them to send any names to you in a voice message, so you can play it back a few times to make sure you’ll be pronouncing them correctly. If you’re handing out several awards, write all the names down phonetically on the piece of paper that you’ll be reading from at the event.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If there’s only one name that you’ll be expected to remember, there are a few options. If there are monitors on the stage, write the name phonetically on a large piece of paper and tape it to the monitor, assuming only you can see it. If there aren’t any monitors, have the name written phonetically on a small piece of white card in your pocket (not a scrap of paper) and say it out loud to yourself several times the day of the event and then do the same thing again just before you go onstage. If it’s a very difficult name to pronounce correctly, at worst, take out that piece of white card from your pocket and say something like:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘I’ve been practicing how to pronounce this person’s name all day, but I’m terrified of getting it wrong. So, I’ve written it down’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">I say <i class="calibre3">‘at worst’</i> because, ideally, you should obviously say it from memory. I’m just giving you a back-up plan that still shows the person respect.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I’m not a fan of comedians having stuff written on the back of their hands because people can spot it from the front row of the audience. However, if you’re only expected to remember one name and it’s a difficult name to remember, a nice trick is to write it in thin, black permanent ink on the inside of your thumb and index finger of the hand that you’ll be holding the mic with (you can buy thin Sharpies). Do this a few minutes before going onstage so it won’t start to rub off. This method doesn’t just work well with people of all skin tones, it means that you can glance down at the name unnoticed without moving your hand because it’s already in a position that you (and only you) can see. Watching comedians getting someone’s name completely wrong as they hand them a lifetime achievement award is one of the sloppiest things I’ve ever witnessed onstage, and seeing them turn their free hand palm down to ‘discreetly’ read from it is a close second. So, work out how you’re going to address this situation.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There are two more topics that I’d like to discuss that you won’t be able to have any control of in advance. I’ve described audiences as being like a flock of birds. At a corporate event, you’ll sometimes be looking out at what feels like a cage of monkeys and the zookeeper has forgotten to lock the door. So, how can you increase your chances of turning them into a flock of birds? The client sending a link to a clip of you doing stand-up to your audience can make a huge difference. However, even if they recognise you when you walk onstage, large round tables make it much harder to create a sense of togetherness in any room, especially when a third of your audience is sitting with their backs to the stage.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I used to try to get around this problem by asking people to turn their chairs to face the stage soon after I arrived onstage. However, people would often choose to ignore my request. Whenever this would happen, I’d achieve nothing other than lowering my status as a result of failing to get my audience to cooperate. At best, there’s a lot of movement and some noise. So, what I now do is ask the person who’s introducing me to tell the audience to turn their chairs to face the stage when they first go onstage to introduce me. If that person is the boss or a senior employee, the audience will do what they’re told. If no one will be introducing you, make an offstage announcement over the microphone, letting the audience know that the show is going to start in a few minutes and ask them to turn their chairs to face the stage during that announcement. If it doesn’t suit your persona to do that, ask one of the organisers to make the offstage announcement for you. If I make the announcement and no one responds, I’ll improvise about the fact that they haven’t cooperated. When you do this, it achieves two things:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">It gives the audience a second chance to turn their chairs to face the stage</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It creates a bond between you and the audience by showing that you’re human</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">Finally, we’ve looked at controlling background noise such as the clinking of cutlery and drinks being made. However, your audience deciding to start talking to each other is one thing that you can’t control in advance. Since the vast majority of the audience at a corporate event haven’t chosen to watch a comedian, you’ll occasionally be faced with a build-up of background talking. The natural thing to do when you’re in this situation is to talk louder, and this may seem like a sensible thing to do, but it’s not. If people are ignoring you to talk and you talk louder into a microphone, all that will do is cause them to talk even louder. To them you’re background noise, and loud noise will always cause people to talk louder.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">So, here are my tips for dealing with constant talking. I’ll assume you aren’t walking onstage to a packed room of people talking, something I’ve fortunately only experienced twice. As soon as you notice that the volume of the talking is starting to build up, wait until there’s a natural pause in a joke, such as when you’re about to create suspense just before a punchline, and deliberately pause for longer than normal. So, a two-second pause instead of half a second. This will create a cartoon-like level of drama for the people listening to you, but what it actually achieves is make the people talking only hear their own voices. This instantly highlights how loudly they’re talking and, believe it or not, can often cause them to instantly stop talking. The average person isn’t inherently shamelessly rude, and this suddenly creates a giant arrow pointing down at their rudeness and that alone can embarrass them into shutting up. You can use that moment to grab their attention. This is a very subtle version of when you’re at a noisy party and someone turns the music off.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">What’s devious about this method is that the people who are listening to you won’t even know that you’ve done it. If the talking gets louder, do it again a minute or two later, but this time pause for so long that you’re clearly addressing the noise, but still don’t mention it. Finish the line, having paused for as long as three seconds in the middle of it. Stopping to address people talking not only suggests that you’re not in control, it puts you at great risk of losing the attention of the people who are enjoying your show. Don’t overlook this point, because the difference between a loyal audience member and someone ignoring you is you not being interesting for two minutes. You’re not oxygen, so they’ll certainly survive without you in their lives.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">There will be some people who’ll stay loyal due to having empathy for you, but audiences are generally fickle. So, focus on the attention of the people who are laughing. If there are far more people enjoying your show than talking, by all means slam the people who are talking in a way that suits your persona. However, there’s absolutely no point trying to get thirty percent of a room to silence the other seventy percent. Plus, if you fail to get them to stop talking, it’s extremely hard to seamlessly return to your set. So, not only will you risk losing more people’s attention, you’ll create a clunky moment when you try to build a bridge between crowd control and material. There’s a small chance that the talking doesn’t stop, and instead gets even louder.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I once performed at a Christmas party where fifty percent of the 250 people in the room were eventually completely ignoring me. Knowing that I could be heard, I played to the people listening as if the talking wasn’t happening, and gave them the show that they’d deserved. However, once the talking became louder than the laughter, every three minutes, I’d calmly say:</p>
      <p class="subsq1"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre3">‘If you’re listening, applaud now’.</i></b></p>
      <p class="subsq1">This mustn’t be said in a desperate tone, just as someone who has been in that situation before and is acknowledging it without mentioning it. This shows control despite the fact that, deep-down, you know that you’re in a bad situation. If you make it very clear that you’re in a bad situation, you’ve lost.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">We’ve all seen police officers or paramedics turn up at a chaotic scene and noticed that their body-language shows that it’s just another day at work for them. That’s the level of control you have to display onstage during a chaotic situation at an event.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If, and this is extremely rare, you’re faced with more people talking than listening to your show and you ask for applause, the people listening will inevitably applaud politely. When this happens, you achieve three things:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">It lets the people who are listening know that you acknowledge their support</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It reassures you that there are still people focused on your performance, giving you the incentive to carry on</li>
        <li class="calibre6">It tricks the people who aren’t listening into thinking that something worth listening to has just happened, increasing your chances of getting more people’s attention</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">To reiterate, I’ve only walked onstage to a roomful of people ignoring me twice in twenty-five years. The first time I let my ego get involved halfway through my gig and went down in flames, and the second time (fourteen years later) I calmly performed to the people listening. If this rare situation ever happens to you and you focus on the people showing you support without making a point of the talking, the people listening to you will see that you’re facing a very tough situation and will appreciate your professionalism for carrying on. You don’t have to point it out.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">What if the noise reaches a volume where there’s clearly no point carrying on? This is an extremely rare situation, and you’ll inevitably know in advance when you might be about to face it. My tip is to make sure you know exactly where the client who you spoke to on the phone is sitting. Let’s say you’re fifteen minutes into a thirty-minute set and the talking has reached a level where the people listening can barely hear what you’re saying. From talking to a few of my peers who’ve also been in this situation, I’ve found that they tend to do one of two things:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Carry on performing to a room of people who are ignoring them until they’ve completed their agreed stage time</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Walk offstage early</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">I believe that neither of these are the right thing to do, because doing your full time onstage in an unplayable situation can feel humiliating, and doesn’t benefit anyone. Walking off early makes perfect sense, but puts you at great risk of not getting paid (certainly not the full amount). So, I propose a third option for this very rare situation, and it’s why I told you to make a note of where the client is sitting. Look over at the client, smile and politely say <i class="calibre3">‘Is there any point me carrying on?’ </i>The fact that you’ve previously bonded with them on the phone means that they’ll have far more empathy for you than had you not previously spoken to them. They will no doubt shake their head. At this moment, wrap up graciously and you’re done. Don’t allow your ego to take over and say something rude, because you’ll regret it. Just thank them and leave. This stops the client losing empathy for you afterwards.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Most importantly, getting their permission to leave means that no one can suggest that you shouldn’t get fully paid. I don’t mean to put fear in you by saying that, but it happened to me at the gig I was ignored at but didn’t take control of. There was a lot of money involved and, after a lengthy debate with my agent, they ended up paying 100% of the fee purely as a result of me knowing where the boss was sitting and asking them that one question. If they don’t show you any empathy and either tell you to carry on or ignore your question, then do a few more minutes and leave having close to done your full stage-time. It’s up to you if you want to stand onstage being ignored until you’ve done your full stage-time, but if you’ve recorded the gig, I doubt anyone would get away with not paying your full fee if you can prove to the person who booked you that you were being ignored by the majority of the room. If there’s no promoter or corporate agent involved and the client has contacted you directly, insist on fifty percent of the fee upfront and the other fifty percent on the morning of the day of the event. If you don’t have the support of an agent, you must not put yourself in a situation where a client can decide not to pay you. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you’re being ignored, remember my advice: do the best you can, and then think of the money on your way home. You’ll actually have the last laugh (and possibly the only one). Just make sure that it’s more money than you’re used to earning, otherwise the joke is on you.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">If you’re faced with what is clearly a potentially unplayable room when you arrive, such as bad sound and lighting as well as a badly set-up room, take the client aside and politely and assertively explain the situation, and tell them that it’s unlikely that you’ll be doing your full stage-time as a result. Explain that you love your job and that, if it does go well, you’ll do things to plan. Say this with authority and explain that you’re speaking from huge experience (even if you’re not). This gives you a perfect ‘out’ if you decide to finish your show early, and they’ll possibly even take it as you doing them a favour by so much as going onstage. After all, no one can force you to do the gig.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">You might be thinking <i class="calibre3">‘What if they don’t understand?’</i> In that case, do as close to your time as possible and, if it does go as badly as you’d predicted, at least you warned them &ndash; which means they’ll be more likely to realise that the problem wasn’t you.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">I can’t stress enough how important it is to say everything with authority when you point out potential problems in the room to the client. When I was a newer comedian, I’d occasionally tell a client that a room wasn’t set up well for comedy and they’d very often respond with a reassuring <i class="calibre3">‘Don’t worry, you’ll be fine’.</i> They don’t say that any more, because I’m clearly talking from the perspective of someone who isn’t nervous, just knows their business. This is why everything has to be said with authority. Otherwise you’re at risk of appearing nervous or out of your depth as opposed to a professional who is explaining what the problem is.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">Now I want you to imagine turning up at a function-room in a smart hotel, wearing jeans and a T-shirt, only to find 700 people in dinner suits and evening dresses and then being introduced as <i class="calibre3">‘a comedian who, I’ll be honest, I haven’t even heard of’</i>, and then walking onstage not knowing a single thing about any of those people. That happened to me when I was twenty-seven years old, and you now know how to make sure it doesn’t happen to you.</p>
      <p class="subsq1">When it comes to performing at private events, you’ll obviously improve with experience. However, if you can do a few things to help your show go as well as possible, there’s no reason why absorbing everything in this chapter can’t fast-track you to regularly getting booked at private events and eventually earning significantly more money than if you didn’t do them. This involves you doing four important things:</p>
      <ul class="calibre5">
        <li class="calibre6">Waiting until you’re comfortable onstage in a club or theatre</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Having the list of twelve questions (plus any of your own) in front of you whenever you speak to a client on the phone</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Writing some bespoke material for the event</li>
        <li class="calibre6">Reading this chapter again on the day of the event</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq1">By the way, it’s worth asking the client those twelve questions just to hear them say the one word they don’t want you to use onstage.</p>
