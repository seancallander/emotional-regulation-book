<h1 class="cl-f-l-v"><img src="images/000070.svg" alt="" class="calibre4" /></h1><p class="cl-cluster">One of the most difficult problems confronting patients with various disorders and diseases is finding the best help available. Everyone is aware of 
friends or family who have sought treatment from a seemingly reputable 
practitioner, only to find out later from another doctor that the original 
diagnosis was wrong or that the treatments recommended were inappropriate, or perhaps even harmful. Most patients, or family members, address 
this problem by reading everything they can about their symptoms, seeking out information on the Internet, or aggressively "asking around" to 
tap knowledge from friends and acquaintances. Governments and health 
care policymakers are also aware that people in need don't always get the 
best treatments-something they refer to as "variability in health care 
practices."</p><p class="cl-cluster">Now health care systems around the world are attempting to correct this 
variability by introducing "evidence-based practice." This simply means 
that it is in everyone's interest that patients get the most up-to-date and 
effective care for a particular problem. Health care policymakers have also 
recognized that it is very useful to give consumers of health care as much 
information as possible, so that they can make intelligent decisions in a collaborative effort to improve health and mental health. This series, "Treatments That WorkTM," is designed to accomplish just that. Only the latest 
and most effective interventions for particular problems are described in 
user-friendly language. To be included in this series, each treatment program must pass the highest standards of evidence available, as determined 
by a scientific advisory board. Thus, when individuals suffering from these 
problems, or their family members, seek out an expert clinician who is familiar with these interventions and decides that they are appropriate, they 
will have confidence that they are receiving the best care available. Of 
course, only your health care professional can decide on the right mix of 
treatments for you.</p><p class="cl-cluster">This particular program presents the latest version of a cognitive-behavioral 
treatment for generalized anxiety disorder that has proven effectiveness and was developed in our own Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders 
at Boston University. In this program, you will learn skills to cope effectively with the chronic tension, irritability, difficulty sleeping, and constant, uncontrollable worry that make life so miserable for people with this 
disorder. This program is most effectively applied by working in collaboration with your clinician.</p><div id="calibre_link-22" title="pagetype_fmatter" class="calibre1"></div>

<h1 class="cl-f-l-v"><img src="images/000072.svg" alt="" class="calibre4" /></h1><h1 class="cl-f-l-v1"><img src="images/000073.svg" alt="" class="calibre4" /></h1><p class="cl-cluster">Goals</p><p class="cl-cluster">■To understand the characteristics of generalized anxiety disorder</p><p class="cl-cluster">■To learn the difference between normal worry and abnormal worry</p><p class="cl-cluster">■To understand what this program is and what it will involve</p><p class="cl-cluster">■To determine whether or not this program is right for you</p><p class="cl-cluster">What is generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)? There are two core features of 
generalized anxiety. The first is excessive worry about things that are unlikely 
to happen, or, if they were to happen, would be much more manageable 
than worriers think. Examples include worrying about the health of one's 
family, worrying about not getting everything done on time at work or at 
home, and worrying about not being good enough as a parent or as a husband or wife. Worry is almost always about events that could happen in the 
future, and therefore, it is characterized by "What if" types of statements.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Excessive worry is typically difficult to stop, or is experienced as if it is out 
of control. At times, you might try to resist worrying because it seems that 
it is excessive, abnormal, or at least not much fun. At other times, you 
might feel that if you do not worry, something terrible might really happen, as if the worrying serves some kind of protective, or even superstitious, function. Sometimes people who are chronic worriers report that 
they become nervous if things seem to be going well in their lives, as if they 
are experiencing the "calm before the storm." In other words, there might 
be a tendency to worry, even if there is nothing to worry about, because 
you are so used to worrying. We will talk about the quality of this type of 
worry later in this chapter and other chapters.</p><p class="cl-cluster">The second core feature of generalized anxiety is a generally high level of physical tension, nervousness, or a feeling of being "uptight" or "high-strung." The 
physical tension is likely to result from excessive and chronic worrying. In addition, high levels of tension add to excessive worrying, since it is hard 
to be worried when feeling physically relaxed. Obviously, the high level of 
physical tension and the excessive worrying feed off of each other, creating 
a vicious cycle. It is this cycle that the program described in this workbook 
is designed to break. The physical tension produces a variety of symptoms, 
such as muscular tension and soreness, headaches, difficulty sleeping, poor 
concentration, diarrhea and frequent urination, and restlessness and general difficulty relaxing.</p><div id="calibre_link-24" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">With the combination of excessive worry and high levels of physical tension, 
it's not hard to understand why you might feel anxious, irritable, tired, and 
generally distressed. If you are a chronic worrier and are overly concerned 
about everything that could go wrong, if you find yourself exhausted at the 
end of the day from driving yourself too hard, and yet wonder what you 
have accomplished and how you are going to get tomorrow's work done, 
this program is likely to be useful for you. Similarly, if you find yourself irritable, tense, and apprehensive a lot of the time, or if you have a nervous 
stomach, headaches, or nausea, associated with stress, then this program is 
likely to be useful for you.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Case Studies-Do You Relate?</p><p class="cl-cluster">To help you evaluate whether this program is suitable for you, read the following examples of people who were treated at our clinic for GAD.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Anne</p><p class="cl-cluster">Annewas a 38-year-old mother of two children, who were 12 and 14 years 
of age. She was a nurse, and was recently promoted to chief of her nursing 
unit. She had returned to nursing 6 years ago, after some time away from 
work while raising her children. Anne came to our clinic with complaints of 
excessive fatigue (tired all the time), irritability, headaches, and poor sleeping. 
On further questioning, it became apparent that Anne worried a great deal 
about managing her nursing unit, and she frequently became irritated and 
angry with the nurses she supervised for not devoting as much care to their 
duties as she thought they should. Therefore, she preferred to do many of the 
tasks herself, believing that it was her responsibility to make sure that everything was done in just the right way. In addition, Anne reported that she was 
frequently concerned about the future of her two children-not only their currentsafety, but also how they would do in college and whether they would 
be happy when they got older. Finally, although she and her husband had no 
debts to speak of Anne was continuously worried about whether they would 
have enough money to maintain their style of living, which was not overly 
indulgent, by any means.</p><div id="calibre_link-25" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Annereported that she typically lay awake at night for an hour or two 
thinking of all of these things and of what she had to do the next day. When she 
was busy, such as dealing with a patient in distress or arguing with her family, 
her mind focused on the task at hand, and she didn't worry. However, whenever she was doing something routine, such as driving or household chores, 
her m ind continually raced from one po ten tial disas ter to an other. The disastrous images included being fired for not getting her work done and finding 
that her children were involved in a car accident. She continuously worried 
a bout the things that she needed to do to prevent these terrible things from 
happening. Her family had told her that, in recent months, she had become 
especially touchy and irritable. Anne herself noted that, since her promotion, 
her level of stress and anxiety had increased, and she never had a moment to 
relax. Anne stated that she remembered a time when she did not feel this way. 
She said that things did not worry her when she was in college the way they 
worried her now. It was not until the birth of her first child that she noticed 
herself taking everything so seriously, feeling as if she had to be prepared for 
any possibility of things going wrong, and worrying nearly every day.</p><p class="cl-cluster">James</p><p class="cl-cluster">&gt;.James attended our clinic because he had generalized anxiety. He was a 
single, 35-year- old computer consultant and also was the co-owner of a bed 
and breakfast inn. James stated that he could not stop worrying about the future of the inn, and he became especially irritated with his business partner, 
who did not seem to be as worried about it. Little things around the inn, 
such as the way the towels were laid out on the beds or where the decorative 
items were placed, "bugged "James a great deal. He felt as if he could not sit 
still until everything was in its right place and perfect. In addition, he was 
very concerned with the financial status of the business, although it was 
doing very well and the rooms were occupied 9o% of the time. In addition, 
James was always worried about making mistakes at work. He was concerned that he might be fired, despite the fact that his performance evaluations were satisfactory (and often complimentary), and no one had ever 
complained about his work.</p><div id="calibre_link-26" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Asa result of his constant state of worry, James frequently experienced panic 
attacks. That is, he would experience a sudden rush of in tense dread and very 
strong symptoms of shortness of breath and a racing heart that lasted only a 
short time. He understood that his high level of stress caused the pan ic attacks, and they were not a major concern for him. He was far more worried 
abo ut his inn and his job than about panic attacks. In addition, James was 
very easily irritated by the smallest incon ven iences, such as poor weather conditions that slowed the drive home after work and minor delays in receiving 
supply deliveries for the inn. His anger tended to interfere with his social relationships, since he frequently became irritated at the "stupidity" or 
"slowness" of others and felt that he could not rely on his friends and family to do 
things for him. In contrast to Anne, James reported that he had been a 
chronic worrier for as long as he could remember. Even in grade school, he recalled being worried about fitting in with the other kids and doing and saying the right things in class.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Asthese examples show, problems with generalized anxiety don't usually 
become so out of control that one can never get their tasks done. On the 
contrary, sometimes worriers use much more energy than they have to in 
completing unnecessary tasks, or completing tasks in an unreasonably short 
time (due to the sense of pressure from believing that everything has to be 
done immediately). On the other hand, worrying about possible negative 
outcomes can sometimes lead to procrastination and perfectionism. For 
example, you might "sit on" a report about the progress of a given project 
at work because of worries that it will be strongly criticized, and because of 
worries that you will be fired as a result. The most common impairment 
that results from generalized anxiety is a feeling that one isn't enjoying life, 
either because leisure activities are given up as one begins to think that 
there are too many other things to do or because the worry interferes with 
enjoying activities that once were pleasurable.</p><p class="cl-cluster">What Are the Specific Criteria for a Diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder?</p><p class="cl-cluster">To diagnose a person with GAD, mental health professionals use criteria 
set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV; APA, 1994).</p><p class="cl-cluster">In this disorder, the key feature is excessive and pervasive (or wide-ranging) 
worry about several life circumstances, such as relationships with family and friends, the health and well-being of oneself or one's family, home management and work responsibilities, finances, and self-worth, and various other 
concerns about neatness, being on time, and so on. Typically, the worry is 
focused on striving for perfection, avoiding making mistakes, maintaining 
a strong sense of responsibility, and attempting to maintain guardedness 
and control as a means of being prepared for and preventing bad things from 
happening. According to the DSM-IV, this type of worry must persist for 
at least six months and must not be the direct result of a real-life trauma, 
such as the kidnapping of one's child or a recent divorce. The DSM-IValso 
emphasizes the difficulty in stopping or "turning off' the worry, as would 
occur if you had difficulty going to sleep due to worrisome thoughts at 
bedtime. In addition, three or more of the symptoms shown in the following list must be present chronically for at least six months. These symptoms must not be the direct result of a physical disease or condition, such 
as menopause or a thyroid disorder. We recommend that our patients have 
a full medical examination to check for possible physical causes of anxiety 
symptoms (e.g., hyperthyroidism), especially if they have not had an examination within the last year.</p><div id="calibre_link-27" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Physical Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition)</p><p class="cl-cluster">Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge</p><p class="cl-cluster">Being easily fatigued</p><p class="cl-cluster">Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank</p><p class="cl-cluster">Irritability</p><p class="cl-cluster">Muscle tension</p><p class="cl-cluster">Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, 
unsatisfying sleep)</p><p class="cl-cluster">How Common Is This Problem?</p><p class="cl-cluster">Generalized anxiety is very common. The prevalence rate of GAD in the 
general population over the past year is estimated to be approximately 4%. 
In the United States, as many as 12 million people suffer from generalized anxiety. However, the experience of severe generalized anxiety is also an 
important part of most other anxiety and phobic disorders. In combination with other phobic and anxiety disorders, the percentage of the general 
population suffering from a disorder that involves generalized anxiety as a 
major component increases to approximately io% to iz%. This represents 
a larger proportion of the general population than those who have alcohol 
or drug abuse problems, and makes anxiety disorders the number one mental health problem in the United States. All sorts of people, at all levels of 
socioeconomic status and in all professions, experience GAD.</p><div id="calibre_link-28" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Generalized Anxiety Disorder in the Elderly</p><p class="cl-cluster">Generalized anxiety disorder becomes more of a problem as we get older. 
In fact, GAD occurs less frequently in younger people, but increases dramatically with age, such that more than 7% of our elderly suffer from this 
condition. As we get older, our worry is more focused on health and safety, 
rather than work, family, and social functioning. For this reason, our elderly friends and relatives often think that they are less healthy than they 
really are, and that they should visit the doctor more often, or that they are 
in more danger of being harmed or of falling than they really are. While it 
is true that we are all at greater risk for falling and are less capable of defending ourselves as we get older, persons with GAD overestimate these risks.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Generalized Anxiety versus Life Crises</p><p class="cl-cluster">Many of the features described as characterizing GAD are similar to the 
symptoms experienced by people who have gone through a major life trauma. 
For example, most people who have lost a member of their family through 
a fatal car accident tend to worry and experience many of the physical symptoms listed earlier. The difference is that GAD does not depend on negative major life events, and in fact, the defining feature of the disorder is 
worrying when there is no real threat.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Another issue is the length of time that the worry and physical symptoms 
are experienced. If a traumatic event happens, and a year later, you are still 
worrying excessively about various life circumstances and still experiencing 
many of the physical symptoms of physical tension, it is likely that GAD has developed, perhaps triggered by the trauma. The worry and symptoms 
must be present for at least six months to be considered GAD.</p><div id="calibre_link-29" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Normal Worry versus Abnormal Worry</p><p class="cl-cluster">A question that naturally arises is how to distinguish between normal and 
abnormal worry. All of us tend to worry some of the time. Worry can serve 
a very adaptive function by helping us to prepare or problem-solve and decide how to cope with upcoming difficult situations (such as exams or work 
performance evaluations). When does worry become unadaptive, and why? 
We will be talking at length about the reasons that worry becomes excessive in the next chapter. One way to determine if your worry is "abnormal" 
is by asking yourself the following questions:</p><p class="cl-cluster">■Do you worry about things that you recognize that most people 
do not worry about (such as weeds in the garden)?</p><p class="cl-cluster">■Do you worry about things that others worry about (such as the 
safety of your children), but in a more exaggerated manner?</p><p class="cl-cluster">■Do you find it very difficult to stop worrying, and do you have 
trouble relaxing as a result?</p><p class="cl-cluster">■Do you worry much of the time without ever reaching a possible 
solution for a particular problem?</p><p class="cl-cluster">■Do you believe that, if you do not worry, a terrible event will actually happen?</p><p class="cl-cluster">■Do you worry about not being worried, or worry when everything is going well in your life?</p><p class="cl-cluster">■Do you believe that you will go crazy with worrying?</p><p class="cl-cluster">If you answer yes to most, or all, of these questions, you are probably experiencing more worry than is normal.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Worry in Other Emotional Disorders</p><p class="cl-cluster">Generalized anxiety is a feature of many types of anxiety and mood disorders. 
If you worry excessively and, at the same time, feel sad and hopeless, with 
a loss of interest and loss of energy (all of which are signs of a depressed 
mood), then consult with your mental health professional to learn if an al ternative form of treatment is more appropriate than the treatment described here. Similarly, if your worry is restricted to a specific object (such 
as an animal), a specific situation (such as being stuck in an elevator or 
speaking in front of a large group), or a specific contaminant (such as certain chemicals that you avoid at all cost), seek the advice of a mental health 
professional as to whether this program will work for you. We have other 
programs in the Treatments That Work"" series that are suitable for specific phobias (Mastery of Your Specific Phobia), social anxiety (Mastery of Your 
SocialAnxiety), and obsessions and compulsions (Mastery of Your Obsessions 
and Compulsions). If you are mostly worried about having panic attacks (sudden, and often unexpected, rushes of intense fear), then a program called 
Mastery of Your Anxiety and Panic may be more appropriate.</p><div id="calibre_link-30" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Is This Program Right for You?</p><p class="cl-cluster">The following list will help you to determine whether you can benefit from 
this program.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Have you:</p><p class="cl-cluster">■worried excessively and pervasively about several life circumstances (such as interpersonal relations, family, health, work, 
finances, or minor matters, such as chores or punctuality)?</p><p class="cl-cluster">■experienced difficulty controlling the worry?</p><p class="cl-cluster">■experienced at least some of the following physical symptoms 
throughout the day: restlessness or feeling keyed up, tiredness, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance?</p><p class="cl-cluster">■experienced worry and physical "nervousness," for at least six 
months, for more days of the week than not?</p><p class="cl-cluster">■tended to worry and be physically tense, even when major life 
crises have not occurred?</p><p class="cl-cluster">■experienced physical symptoms that a medical doctor cannot attribute directly to physical or organic causes?</p><p class="cl-cluster">■noticed that your major problem revolves around chronic and 
uncontrollable worry about future events, instead of fear of specific objects, fear of social evaluation, fear of contamination, selfdoubt, or fear of having panic attacks?</p><div id="calibre_link-31" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Brief Description of the Program</p><p class="cl-cluster">In this program, you will learn to control your "out-of-control" and unproductive worry and anxiety. The program is divided into twelve components, or chapters. In each chapter, you will learn specific skills. The skills 
will build on each other, so that in each new chapter, you will use skills 
learned in earlier chapters. The types of skills that you will learn include 
reducing physical tension, controlling excessive worry, and dealing with 
real problem situations. The program is obviously structured, but within 
that structure, there is room for individual tailoring.</p><p class="cl-cluster">At the end of each chapter, you will find homework and a self-assessment 
quiz that will help you to determine whether you've learned and retained the 
information in the chapter. If not, it is a sign for you to review the material again. Most people go over the chapters repeatedly. When you believe that 
you understand the material and have completed the exercises, you may go 
on to the next chapter. The importance of the exercises cannot be emphasized enough, because the success of the program is based largely on your 
completing them.</p><p class="cl-cluster">The pacing of the program is somewhat up to you. The most important 
issue is to complete the homework thoroughly and to understand the main 
points of each chapter before you begin the next chapter. The basic outline 
of the chapters is as follows:</p><p class="cl-cluster">Mastery of Your Anxiety and Worry Treatment Program Outline</p><p class="cl-cluster">i.Is this program right for you? The nature of generalized anxiety</p><p class="cl-cluster">2.Learning to recognize your own anxiety</p><p class="cl-cluster">3.The purpose and function of anxiety</p><p class="cl-cluster">4.A closer look at generalized anxiety disorder</p><p class="cl-cluster">5.Learning to relax</p><p class="cl-cluster">6.Controlling thoughts that cause anxiety: I.Overestimating the risk</p><p class="cl-cluster">7.Controlling thoughts that cause anxiety: II.

<p class="cl-cluster">io.Dealing with real problems: Time management, goal-setting, and 
problem-solving</p><p class="cl-cluster">it.Drugs for anxiety and their relation to this program</p><p class="cl-cluster">12.Your accomplishments and your future</p><p class="cl-cluster">Alternative Treatments</p><p class="cl-cluster">Even though you may have had contact with other mental health professionals in the past, or may have used drugs to treat your anxiety, you may 
still benefit from this program. However, some consideration must be given 
to other kinds of treatment that may be ongoing while you are participating in this program.</p><p class="cl-cluster">We recommend that, if you undertake this program, you should not be 
participating in other forms of psychotherapy that are also focused specifically on the treatment of anxiety. As with all treatments or programs that 
are focused on the same problem, messages can become mixed or confused. 
For that reason, we find it much more effective to do only one treatment 
program at a time. However, if you are participating in another psychotherapy program that is very general in its orientation or is focused on a 
very different area (for example, marital problems), then there is no reason 
why the two cannot be done at the same time.</p><p class="cl-cluster">If you are involved in another program right now that deals specifically with 
the treatment of generalized anxiety, we recommend that you continue with 
that program until you are sure that either it is effective (in which case you 
won't need another type of treatment) or it is ineffective (in which case you 
can try this program). As you will soon see, the type of program described 
in this workbook has been found to be very effective for many people, but 
that does not mean that other programs should not be given a fair trial. 
Different forms of therapy are more or less effective for different people. 
You must make this decision before you commit to go ahead with the program in this workbook.</p><p class="cl-cluster">This program will be appropriate even if you are currently taking drugs to 
control your anxiety. Many people enter our treatments while taking drugs. 
After finishing the treatment, approximately 50% of the people who were 
taking drugs, such as minor tranquilizers, stopped needing them and stopped 
taking them. Others stopped taking their medication with the help of their physician. Drugs used to treat anxiety will be described in more detail in

<p class="cl-cluster">Ideally, you will be working on this program with the help of your doctor 
or a mental health professional, who may have given you this workbook.</p><p class="cl-cluster">What Benefits Will You Receive from This Program?</p><p class="cl-cluster">We developed this program at the Center for Stress and Anxiety Disorders, 
in Albany, New York. It has been substantially revised and updated at our 
Centers at Boston University (directed by Dr. Barlow) and the University 
of California at Los Angeles (directed by Dr. Craske). One of the purposes 
of our Centers is to develop new treatments for anxiety disorders. The National Institutes of Health and other funding agencies provide financial support, and our Centers have become well known for this activity, with the 
Boston Center being the largest clinical research facility of its kind in the 
world. From research studies conducted at our Centers, we have found that 
the type of treatment described in this program is quite successful. Approximately 70% of the people who complete the program are markedly improved, in terms of their physical symptoms, their tendency to worry, and the 
extent to which they generally find enjoyment in their daily lives. Furthermore, individuals tend to maintain their gains over the long term.</p><p class="cl-cluster">As with many of our programs designed to treat anxiety problems, one of 
the biggest predictors of successful outcome is the amount of practice that 
one does. The treatment is essentially a learning program, and it requires 
quite a bit of work and dedication. To help you decide if this treatment is 
right for you, think of all of the reasons why you want to make changes. 
Think of all of the times you feel exhausted and unhappy, the times you 
are irritable with your family and friends, and think of your own physical 
health. Then think of ways in which your life will be better when you learn 
to control your worry and anxiety.</p><p class="cl-cluster">What Is the Cost?</p><p class="cl-cluster">On the other side of the equation is the amount of time and energy needed 
to carry out this program over the next to to i2 weeks. The more you put 
into it, the more you will get out of it. We will be teaching you new ways 
of thinking and acting, but these changes have to come from you. These skills are only as good as the dedication of the person using them. With endurance and effort, these skills can be highly effective. It is not the severity 
of your anxiety, your age, or the length of time you have been a chronic 
worrier that determines success. Your motivation and persistence in making changes will determine your success. This is a decision for you to make 
right now, in light of the potential benefits. Do you have the motivation at 
this time to give this program your best effort? Remember that you are 
probably putting out as much energy and effort worrying and feeling anxious as you would be by going through this program, but with this program, positive changes will result. Also, remember that you cannot judge 
your success with a treatment accurately until you have given the treatment 
a fair trial. In other words, even if you have strong doubts about this particular treatment approach, wait until you have tried it to make a judgment.</p><div id="calibre_link-34" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">If you do not have the motivation right now, then it is better to wait for 
another time. You will be defeating yourself by beginning a program like 
this halfheartedly. The following decision tree is designed to help you reach 
your final decision about whether to try this treatment now or to wait until 
you feel ready.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Decision Tree</p><div class="graphic"><img src="images/000003.jpg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><div id="calibre_link-2" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

Progress Record</p><p class="cl-cluster">■To learn how to monitor your anxiety for one week</p><p class="cl-cluster">■To complete the self-assessment</p><p class="cl-cluster">Record-Keeping</p><p class="cl-cluster">This chapter presents the importance of record-keeping and describes 
the method used in this program. For the rest of the time that you participate in this program, you must keep ongoing records of your mood state, 
among other things. Record-keeping is a necessary part of the success of 
this program.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Why Take the Time to Record? I Know I Am Anxious!</p><p class="cl-cluster">There are many reasons why it is important to keep records of your anxiety on a regular, ongoing basis. First, intense or chronic anxiety typically 
feels as if it is out of control or has a life of its own. You probably feel as if 
you are a victim of your own anxiety. Learning to be an observer, as opposed to a victim, of your own anxiety is a first step toward gaining control. Through record-keeping, you will learn to observe when, where, and 
under what circumstances your anxiety occurs. As a result, you will gain an 
understanding of the factors that cause your anxiety to increase and to continue, which in turn, will make you feel more in control and less of a victim. Second, you will learn to understand the way in which you experience anxiety, in terms of what you think, what you feel, and what you do. This is 
very important because the treatment in this program is designed specifically to change anxious thinking, anxious feelings, and anxious behaviors. 
They cannot be changed without knowing exactly what they are.</p><div id="calibre_link-35" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Another important reason for regular, ongoing record-keeping is that this 
type of monitoring provides much more accurate information than you get 
by simply asking yourself, "How have I been feeling lately?" If you were asked 
to describe the last week, you may judge it to have been very bad, when in 
fact, there may have been several times when you felt relatively calm. When 
anxiety is on your mind so much, it is easy to forget about the times when 
you were not anxious. As you can probably see, thinking about the previous week as very "bad," while overlooking relatively "OK" times during the 
week, is likely to make you feel worse and more anxious. In fact, such negative judgments about how you've been doing in general may contribute to 
ongoing chronic anxiety. By keeping ongoing records, you will feel more in 
control and less anxious. Record-keeping forces you to recognize that your 
mood state fluctuates and that there are times when you feel less anxious 
than at other times.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Sometimes, people are concerned that, by continually recording their levels of anxiety, they will be reminded of how anxious they feel, which in turn, 
will make them feel even more anxious. You may be particularly concerned 
about this possible inflation effect if you are anxious or worried about feeling anxious (in other words if the anxiety feels as if it is out of your control). 
To address this concern, it is important to distinguish between two ways of 
monitoring mood states: subjective monitoring and objective monitoring.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Subjective monitoring means monitoring "how bad you feel," how severe 
the anxiety is, how much it interferes with your life, or how you can't control it. It's like being in the middle of a giant bowl of gelatin and feeling as 
if there's no way you can get out. Subjective monitoring is likely to be 
something that you already do, and maybe something that you try to avoid 
because it worsens your overall anxiety. Objective monitoring, which is the 
technique you will be learning in this chapter, means monitoring the features of anxiety in a more "scientific" way. You will learn to record things 
such as the number or intensity of symptoms, the triggers of your anxiety, 
and your thoughts and behavioral responses to anxiety. Objective monitoring is more like standing outside of the giant bowl of gelatin and noting 
exactly what color it is and how many times it shakes.</p><div id="calibre_link-36" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">At first, it may be difficult to switch from subjective to objective monitoring, 
and as you start to use the records, you may indeed notice an increase in your 
anxiety because you are focusing on your feelings in the old, subjective way. 
However, with practice, most people are able to shift to the objective mode. 
To help you do this, we have developed very specific forms on which very 
specific objective information is to be recorded. These will be described soon.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Let's review all of the benefits of ongoing monitoring, as well as the reasons 
why it is crucial to this program:</p><p class="cl-cluster">■To identify specific triggers of episodes of high anxiety. Knowledge of these triggers and situations will lessen the sense of your 
anxiety being out of your control. It is easy to lose track of the 
specific triggers, partly because they can be very subtle and hard 
to identify, and partly because you may start to respond to triggers out of habit, without even knowing consciously what it is 
you are responding to. Record-keeping will help you to identify 
the triggers of your anxiety.</p><p class="cl-cluster">■To identify the specific ways in which you experience anxiety. 
These include your physical feelings, thoughts, and behaviors.</p><p class="cl-cluster">■To evaluate the success of your attempts to change. Remember, 
when you are anxious, it is easy to dismiss gains and focus instead on how anxious and terrible you feel. Objective monitoring will help you to appreciate your gains. When an episode of 
high anxiety makes you feel as if you've failed or fallen back, the 
records will show the changes that you've made, so that the one 
incident of high anxiety does not overshadow your progress. So, 
keep all of your forms for the purpose of review. It's a good idea 
to start a folder for your records.</p><p class="cl-cluster">■To become an objective observer of yourself so that you can 
begin to stand outside the bowl of gelatin. This is an important 
step in your progress.</p><p class="cl-cluster">What Do I Record?</p><p class="cl-cluster">The various procedures that you will be taught in the following chapters will 
have their own forms that will be explained to you with each chapter. However, there are two records that you are asked to use for the entire program. The first form is called a Worry Record. This form is to be used any time that 
you notice a sharp increase in your anxiety, when you find yourself worrying, or when you're experiencing particular physical symptoms, such as irritability, muscle tension, poor concentration, restlessness, or feeling keyed 
up, or increased fatigue or sleep disturbance. Information from this particular monitoring form will be invaluable for understanding the triggers and 
components of your anxiety.</p><div id="calibre_link-37" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">The form has eight sets of ratings. At the top, record the date and the time 
that the episode of heightened anxiety began. Next, circle the maximum level 
of anxiety that you felt, from the time that you noticed the anxiety episode 
had begun until now (the time that you are completing the form). Then, 
check any of the symptoms that you experienced, from the time that the 
episode began until now. Although you may feel some of these symptoms 
"all the time," indicate which ones you felt more intensely than usual. Then, 
give a brief description of the triggers that may have contributed to your 
heightened anxiety. These triggers might include the time of day (such as 
just before the end of the workday, when you start to worry about not having enough time to get everything done), reading a newspaper article about 
diseases, failing to hear from a family member at an expected time, and so 
on. If you don't know what triggered your anxiety, just write "don't know." 
Then, in the "Anxious thoughts" section, record what you are worried 
about happening. This part of the record is very important, so be as specific as you can in describing your thoughts. We will spend a lot of time on 
the nature of anxious thoughts in chapter 3. Next, record your behaviors in 
response to your worry, such as pacing, calling to check on family members, 
or trying to distract your mind from worrying. Finally, record at what time 
you noticed a marked decrease in your worry or a decline in the intensity 
of your physical sensations (at the top right corner of the Worry Record). 
A blank copy of the Worry Record is shown. (Note: Two different versions 
of the Worry Record will be used once you get to chapters 6 and 7.)</p><p class="cl-cluster">As can be seen from the following example, James became very anxious at 
around 5 P.M.Sunday, and reported that he felt that way for the next four 
hours. His maximum level of anxiety by the time he made his ratings was 
6o, or strong. He noted restlessness and feeling keyed up, difficulty concentrating, and irritability. He was unable to relate his anxiety to any specific triggering event, except that it was the night before the beginning of 
a new workweek, and he typically became quite anxious on Sunday nights, 
when thinking of the coming week. James noted that he was thinking about all of the problems that could occur at work and how they would interfere 
with the tight schedule he had that week. He said that he worried about 
not getting everything done in time and being criticized by his boss. His 
anxious behaviors included attempted distraction by watching TV, but he 
was unsuccessful.</p><div id="calibre_link-38" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

of 70) on Thursday at z.oo P.M.She felt restlessness, difficulty concentrating, and muscle tension. The triggering event that she noted was that her 
husband did not call at his usual time. Anne noted that she was worried about his safety (and continued worrying until he called 45 minutes later). 
In particular, she was worried that his recent stomach complaints could 
have turned into a major physical problem, and she imagined him collapsing at work. Consequently, her behavioral response was to repeatedly try to 
call her husband on his cell phone.</p><div id="calibre_link-41" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Worry Record for Ann</p><p class="cl-cluster"><img src="images/000078.svg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p><p class="cl-cluster">The information that you record on these forms will help you to understand patterns in your anxiety response that you may not have been aware 
of before.</p><div id="calibre_link-42" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Daily Mood Record</p><p class="cl-cluster"><img src="images/000079.svg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p><p class="cl-cluster">The second form is the Daily Mood Record, to be completed at the end of 
each day, just before you go to sleep.</p><p class="cl-cluster">We find it most helpful to use a scale of o to ioo points for rating levels of 
anxiety. In the first column, record your average, or overall, level of anxiety over the day, by taking all of the day into consideration. Choose a number from o to too, where ioo equals extreme anxiety and o equals no anxiety. 
These o- to too-point ratings will become second nature to you after a little 
practice. Using a number scale is a much more objective method of rating 
your mood state than recording words or phrases about how you feel. In 
the second column, record the maximum, or highest, level of anxiety you 
felt during the day, using the same o-too-point scale. If nothing important 
happened during the day and you did not experience episodes of heightened 
anxiety, then the numbers in the first two columns should be the same. In the third column, record your average or overall level of physical tension or discomfort, including aches and pains, irritability, poor concentration, restlessness, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping, taking all of the day into consideration. 
In the fourth column, record your average or overall level of preoccupation 
with worries, again taking all of the day into consideration, in other words, 
how much of the day your mind was focused on worrisome thoughts. The 
fifth column is left blank in case you have something specific that you want 
to additionally monitor (such as procrastination or nail biting).</p><div id="calibre_link-43" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">In the following example, we can see that James had a mixed week, with some 
days having higher ratings than other days. Remember, if we had asked 
James at the end of the week how this week had been, he may have said 
that he was anxious all week, when in fact, his anxiety level, physical ten sion, and preoccupation with worry were quite mild on two days (Tuesday 
and Thursday). James elected to rate headaches as well, because they were a 
particularly frequent and distressing symptom for him.</p><div id="calibre_link-44" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Daily Mood Record for James</p><p class="cl-cluster"><img src="images/000080.svg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p><div id="calibre_link-45" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Finally, it is important to keep a chart of your improvement, based on information gathered from the Worry Record and the Daily Mood Record. 
The Progress Record is designed to summarize your progress over the week 
so that you can easily view changes over the course of the entire program. You 
can select any feature that you are recording to summarize on your Progress 
Record. A blank copy of the Progress Record follows. At the very least, we 
recommend that you record the number of anxiety episodes that you ex perience each week (determined from the number of Worry Records that 
you complete each week) and the average of the maximum anxiety ratings 
that you make over the course of a week. To determine the maximum anxiety rating average, simply average all of the o-to too-point ratings that you 
record under the "Maximum Anxiety" column on the Daily Mood Record 
for one week.</p><div id="calibre_link-46" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

<p class="cl-cluster">As shown in the following example, James completed 12 Worry Records 
during his first week, and on his Daily Mood Record, he had the following 
maximum anxiety ratings: 70, 6o, 30, 70, 30, 40, 50. First he added these 
ratings to get a total (in his case, it equals 350). Then, he divided his total by the number of ratings (35o divided by 70, in this example) to get his maximum anxiety average of So for the first week. During the second week, he 
completed to Worry Records, and the average of his maximum anxiety was 
50. You can see how the remainder of the weeks turned out.</p><div id="calibre_link-48" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

<p class="cl-cluster">The Progress Record is divided into weeks, up to 12 weeks, but you can add 
more, if necessary. This graph will help you to keep everything in perspective. It may be helpful to place the Progress Record in a very visible place, 
such as on your bathroom mirror or refrigerator (or somewhere where it is 
not visible to others, but very noticeable to you), so that you will be reminded of the positive changes that you are making.</p><p class="cl-cluster">One cannot emphasize enough the importance of this record-keeping. The 
Worry Record and the Daily Mood Record must be completed daily to get 
the full benefit of the program. At first, you may have to push yourself to 
keep these records, but it will become easier, and even rewarding, as you 
continue. It helps to give yourself feedback, and the information is also 
very helpful to your mental health professional.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Homework</p><div class="graphic"><img src="images/000006.jpg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><div class="graphic"><img src="images/000007.jpg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><p class="cl-cluster">Begin to monitor your anxiety episodes and daily anxiety for a full

each episode of heightened anxiety as well as the Daily Mood rating? If you 
did not do the record-keeping, think of ways to improve your compliance, 
because this program depends on accurate record-keeping. In fact, recordkeeping is the first step toward change. As explained in the previous chapter, record-keeping enables you to develop a more objective level of selfawareness. Keeping objective records will help you to feel more in control of 
your anxiety and worry. In addition, the monitoring is essential for obtaining detailed information about the way in which you experience anxietywhat you physically feel, what you think, and what you do. If you have not 
completed any monitoring, we recommend that you use the following 
week to monitor before continuing with the program.</p><p class="cl-cluster">If you have completed the monitoring, well done! Now, look at your records 
to see what you can learn. Does your anxiety occur in response to the same types of triggers time after time, such as work responsibilities or family 
events? Do the same types of thoughts tend to come to mind when you are 
anxious, or are they varied? What time of day or day of the week do you 
experience the most anxiety? It may be too early to detect patterns, or it 
may not. Also, now that you have kept a full week of records, the summary 
can be added to the Progress Record. Fill in the number of anxiety episodes 
that you experienced over the past week (by counting the number of Worry 
Records) and the average maximum anxiety rating (by averaging the maximum anxiety ratings you made each day on the Daily Mood form). Of 
course, you may add other summaries to your Progress Record as well.</p><div id="calibre_link-50" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Looking for patterns in the triggers and the way you experience anxiety is the 
first step toward learning that anxiety is a reaction. Although it may feel as 
if it is out of your control, anxiety is a reaction to something. There are ways 
of changing or learning to react differently, once you know what the triggers are. Let's examine the nature of anxiety and discuss specifically the 
process of worry-why it begins in the first place, and how it keeps going.</p><p class="cl-cluster">The State of Anxiety</p><p class="cl-cluster">Anxiety is a natural state that is experienced by everybody. In many cases, 
anxiety is a productive, driving force. Think of performers, who have to get 
up on stage in front of a large crowd; having some anxiety will motivate 
them to perform at their best. Years of research have shown over and over 
again that having some anxiety enhances performance: that is, you do better at what you're doing, whether in the classroom, at a business meeting, 
or on the tennis court, when anxiety rises to a certain optimal level.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Anxiety has one overriding purpose, and that is protection and preparation. Anxiety prepares you to deal with threats or dangers that could happen at any minute. When you think a threat or danger is about to occur, 
anxiety helps you to shift into a state of fearful fight or flight (the natural 
reaction to immediate danger). While anxiety is similar to fear, the two are 
somewhat different. Anxiety is the state of preparation for danger that could 
occur in the future. Fear is the response that occurs when the threat or danger is perceived as being immediately present. Anxiety makes the activation 
of fear easier. For instance, imagine that you are walking through a jungle 
and are concerned that a lion may be hiding behind the trees. You would be in a state of anxiety, and as a result, you would be on guard, watching for 
any signs of possible lion attack. Your body would be geared up and ready 
to take action, if necessary. If a lion suddenly emerged from the trees and 
ran toward you, the emotion of fear and the associated "fight-or-flight" response would take over so that you would either run away or face the danger. The bottom line is that fear and anxiety are protective.</p><div id="calibre_link-51" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">When anxiety is chronic, however, it is as if you are in a state of constant 
preparation for threat or danger. Importantly, the threat does not have to 
be real, since anxiety can occur when you only think that danger or threat 
could happen. The danger or threat does not have to mean something as 
severe as your life being threatened by a killer. It can be anything that is 
negative, ranging from the threat of death to the threat of ridicule or failure. A successful business executive who is challenged by a new assignment 
or project may experience considerable stress and anxiety and may be driven 
to work long hours in order to avoid failure, criticism, and a sense of loss 
of mastery and control. Or, a mother of three children may be challenged 
by the demands of school and may become anxious that her children will 
fail. From this, it should be clear that different people find different things 
threatening or challenging.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Let's look at some examples. Suppose you are having a hard day at the office 
and you have a deadline to meet by 5:00 P.m. or your boss will be upset. 
Or, suppose your sister-in-law is picking you up in 15 minutes to go to a 
meeting. Your young children aren't cooperating, and you're not close to 
being ready. You know that your sister-in-law will be annoyed and that 
you'll be late for the meeting. Here, the threats are less obvious, but they 
are still present. You may fail to meet your deadline and be criticized by 
your boss, a person who is important to you, or you may upset your sisterin-law and interrupt a meeting by entering after it has begun. If you did 
not care at all about the task at work or the meeting, or about the reaction 
of your boss or your sister-in-law, you would most likely feel no anxiety.</p><p class="cl-cluster">In these examples, the deadlines and timelines clearly are the immediate 
triggers for anxiety. As we mentioned earlier, many times, it is unclear what 
is triggering anxiety, and one of the first goals of this program is to discover 
those triggers.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Continuing with our examples, if the anxiety were severe enough, and you 
became convinced that the worst you imagined was about to come true (that you would be fired or that your children would be harmed, for example), you might experience the fearful fight-or-flight response right in your 
office or at home. This fear response would occur, even though there was 
no real, immediate danger. You might experience a panic attack and feel as 
if you were losing control, having a heart attack, or suffocating. Then, you 
would feel like escaping or "getting out," even though you knew there was 
really nothing to be afraid of. On the other hand, you might experience the 
"fight" response, lash out, and slap your kids, or lose your temper with the 
workers in your office, almost before you realized it was happening.</p><div id="calibre_link-52" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Now that the nature of anxiety has been described, it is important to recognize that, although it is a natural response when threat is perceived, anxiety 
becomes problematic if it is experienced too frequently or too intensely. Anxiety can vary tremendously in severity, from mild uneasiness to extreme distress, and it can vary in frequency, from occasional to seemingly constant 
unease. When anxiety is very intense or very frequent, it can interfere with 
your life and feel as if it is out of control. The goal of this program is to 
help you learn to reduce the frequency or intensity of your anxiety, but not 
to remove anxiety altogether, because that would be not only impossible, 
but also undesirable. A little anxiety is needed to motivate performance, 
and a lot of anxiety is needed when there are real threats.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Components of Anxiety</p><p class="cl-cluster">Anxiety is difficult to manage when viewed as a whole, since the global approach does not provide clues for controlling anxiety. How many times have 
you said to yourself (or heard others say to you), "Just calm down. Stop 
being so anxious." How many times has that statement been effective in 
calming you? It probably hasn't worked very well because telling yourself 
to be less anxious does not tell you how to do it. Thinking about anxiety in 
terms of its components takes away a lot of its mystery and its seemingly 
uncontrollable quality. In addition, thinking about anxiety in terms of its 
parts helps you to identify ways to learn to be less anxious. Scientists often 
break anxiety down into three components: physical, cognitive (thoughts), 
and behavioral. That is why you have begun to record your physical symptoms, your thoughts, and your behaviors. Let's spend some time understanding these different components.</p><div id="calibre_link-53" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Physical Component</p><p class="cl-cluster">The physical component involves physical sensations or symptoms, such as 
muscular tension, irritability, fatigue, restlessness, and difficulty concentrating. The nervous system causes various physical effects during states of anxiety and fear, and since some of the symptoms seem unexplainable or unusual (such as blurry vision or pressure in your head), they can also provoke 
anxiety. However, remember that the physical symptoms are the side effects 
of a response that is meant to protect you as your body prepares for danger or threat. Although the symptoms may seem frightening, they are actually part of a self-protective system and are not dangerous at all.</p><p class="cl-cluster">When danger or threat is perceived, the brain sends messages to a section 
of your nerves called the "autonomic nervous system." The autonomic nervous system has two branches, called the "sympathetic nervous system" and 
the "parasympathetic nervous system." These two branches of the nervous 
system are directly involved in controlling the body's energy levels when preparing for action. Simply put, the sympathetic nervous system is the one 
that prepares the body for threat or danger by making it ready for the fightor-flight response: it primes the body for action. The parasympathetic system 
is responsible for regaining balance and restoring the system to a normal 
resting state. However, these two systems do not always work in unison. A 
useful analogy is the accelerator (representing the sympathetic nervous system) and brake (representing the parasympathetic nervous system) pedals 
in a car; at any given second, only the accelerator, only the brakes, both the 
accelerator and the brakes, or neither may be in use.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Recent research indicates that chronic worry and anxiety are associated more 
with low levels of parasympathetic activity than with high levels of sympathetic arousal. Low levels of parasympathetic control mean that the brakes 
are used less of the time; the accelerator may not be in full throttle, but 
nonetheless, it is not being controlled by the brakes as well as it could be. 
The result is a sustained physiological response, without a lot of change. This 
may explain the chronic symptoms of GAD, such as muscle tension, backache, headache, poor sleep, irritability, and difficulty relaxing. In contrast, 
the physiology associated with specific fears leads to physical symptoms that 
increase quickly and then decrease in the presence and absence, respectively, of the anxiety-producing object.</p><div id="calibre_link-54" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Fortunately, some of our own research has shown that low levels of parasympathetic activation can be corrected with the type of treatment that is 
described in this workbook.</p><p class="cl-cluster">In contrast to chronic worry and anxiety is the physiology of fear, which is 
brought on by a perceived immediate threat. Under such conditions, the 
sympathetic nervous system takes charge and releases two chemicals from 
the adrenal glands of the kidney. These chemicals are called "adrenaline" 
and "noradrenaline." They are used as messengers by the sympathetic nervous system to tell the rest of the body to prepare for fight or flight. Other 
chemicals in the body eventually destroy adrenaline and noradrenaline, so 
the fight-or-flight arousal cannot continue forever, although the response 
may continue to rise and fall, and even after the immediate danger and the 
surge of emotion have passed, you are likely to feel keyed up for some time. 
This is perfectly natural. In fact, this prolonged response has an adaptive 
function, because in the wild, danger has a habit of returning, and it is useful for the organism to remain in a prepared state to reactivate the emergency response (fear), if necessary.</p><p class="cl-cluster">The chemical changes that activate the fight-or-flight response produce various symptoms. For example, the heart rate increases, which helps to speed 
up blood flow, thus improving the delivery of oxygen to and removal of 
waste products from the tissues. When this occurs, it is common to feel as 
if your heart is racing or pounding very hard. There is also a change in 
blood flow. Basically, blood is redirected away from the places where it is 
not needed, such as the skin, fingers, and toes, and toward the places where 
it is needed, such as the large muscles in the arms, legs, and chest, by an expansion and constriction of the different blood vessels. When this occurs, 
it is common to feel your feet and hands becoming cold, and even numb 
or tingly. In addition, breathing usually becomes faster. This has obvious 
importance for the body's self-defense, since the tissues need to get more 
oxygen so that you can move more quickly. In turn, you might feel breathless, a sensation of being smothered, or discomfort, or even pain, in your 
chest. One side effect of an increased breathing rate and hyperventilation 
(when the oxygen is not actually consumed at the rate at which it is taken 
in) is that the blood supply to the brain is actually reduced. While it is only 
slightly reduced and is not dangerous, it produces a collection of unpleasant symptoms, including dizziness, blurred vision, confusion, a feeling of 
unreality, and perhaps a sensation of not getting enough air. Usually, sweat gland activity also increases, as a way of cooling the body and preventing 
overheating, should you have to fight or flee.</p><div id="calibre_link-55" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Various other physical changes take place during fear, or the fight-or-flight 
response, including widening of the pupils, which might result in various 
strange visual effects (such as increased intensity of visual stimulation or 
blurred vision). A decrease in salivation also occurs, causing dry mouth, as 
well as a decrease in activity in the digestive system, which often produces 
a heavy feeling in the stomach.</p><p class="cl-cluster">As you can see, whereas the physiology of worry and chronic anxiety (about 
future uncertain or threatening events) involves chronically elevated muscle 
tension and restlessness, with little change, the physiology of fear (when one 
feels immediately threatened) is associated with a distinct peak in sympathetic nervous system arousal. You might feel the physical effects of chronic 
anxiety most of the time and feel the effects of fear occasionally, especially 
at those moments when you become convinced that what you are most 
worried about is actually going to come true. This distinction between anxiety and fear is important because the state of anxiety and worry may actually block the physiological experience of fear. In other words, worrying 
may block the physiological reactions associated with being afraid. As described later, it may even be the case that worry will continue because it feels 
better than being afraid. For example, feeling tense and irritable, with difficulty sleeping, is better than feeling short of breath, dizzy, or disoriented, 
with your heart racing. In this way, anxiety and worry may become a way of 
avoiding fear. One of the goals of this program is to learn to face the fear, 
so that it has a chance to subside, and thereby lessen the need for worry.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Thinking Component</p><p class="cl-cluster">Similar to the body's preparation for a threat or danger, the mind also prepares, when in an anxious state. One of the major effects of feeling anxious 
is a shift of attention toward the source of threat. Thoughts or images become focused on a sense of impending doom, thoughts that something bad 
is about to happen, or nervous wondering about what is going to happen. 
There is usually a tendency to believe that negative events are particularly 
likely to happen, even though their actual probability is very low. There is 
also a tendency to focus exclusively on the worst possible outcome, instead 
of the more positive outcomes.</p><div id="calibre_link-56" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">When we feel anxiety, our minds naturally scan our environment for possible signs of threat. This is valuable in terms of survival, because it means 
that you will notice danger very quickly, if it does exist. However, if you 
are chronically anxious, your persistent focus on the possibility of a threat, 
or of things going wrong in the future, is likely to interfere with your attention to things going on right in front of you, such as the conversations 
happening at the moment or your current job tasks. You are more likely to 
be distracted.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Anxious thoughts (the ones that have to do with all of the possible negative outcomes) are referred to as "worry," which is a main feature of GAD. 
We will spend some time discussing the role of worry. At this point, it is 
important for you to recognize that anxious thoughts or images are one 
component of your anxiety. In addition, worrisome thoughts can contribute to other components of anxiety (such as the physiology and behaviors), 
and the physiology and behaviors of anxiety can also contribute to worrisome thoughts. The interactions among thoughts, behaviors, and physiology are described in more detail later in this chapter.</p><p class="cl-cluster">There are a number of common themes in chronic worry:</p><p class="cl-cluster">t.Health. This can include worries about your own health or the health 
of family and friends, images of sickness and disease, and your own 
inability to cope, should you or somebody close to you become sick. 
You may become anxious when hearing about others falling ill because it reminds you of the possibility that you or a loved one might 
become sick.</p><p class="cl-cluster">z.Friends/family. This can include worries about being a good parent or 
friend, the general happiness and well-being of your family and 
friends, their safety, and whether you are saying or doing the right 
things by them.</p><p class="cl-cluster">3.Work/school. This is another area that is often a source of worry. For 
example, you might worry about completing all of the tasks for the 
day or the week, wonder whether you are performing at the level that 
is expected or making mistakes, or wonder whether the entire office 
for which you are responsible is working in the way that it should.</p><p class="cl-cluster">4.Finances. Sometimes people worry about paying their bills or having 
enough money for the future, even though they do have enough 
money to cover their expenses.</p><div id="calibre_link-57" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">5.Daily life. These worries include thinking that a negative outcome is 
lurking around every corner, including constant worry about day-today activities, such as being on time, traffic, presenting a good appearance, chores, and so on.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Although people who are chronic worriers tend to worry about the same 
kinds of things as people who are not chronic worriers, chronic worry is 
characterized by an added dimension of not being able to stop the worry. 
The chronic worrier may lie in bed at night, worrying about upcoming 
events during the week or the years to come, despite the desire to stop worrying, whereas others are more easily able to dismiss their worries. Similarly, the chronic worrier may bring work-related worries home, instead of 
being able to "turn them off." A good deal of this program is aimed at helping you to learn how to "turn off" worries.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Several underlying beliefs are associated with chronic worry; and these beliefs may explain, in large part, why it is so difficult to turn off the worry.</p><p class="cl-cluster">t.Perfectionism, or the underlying belief that one cannot, and should 
not, make mistakes, and that to make mistakes, in judgment, decisionmaking, parenting, work, or wherever, represents incompetence in 
managing life.</p><p class="cl-cluster">z.Responsibility, or the underlying belief that it is irresponsible not to 
attend to negative possibilities, that worries that pop up in one's 
mind should not be ignored, and that worrying means that you are 
being responsible, whereas not worrying is to be irresponsible.</p><p class="cl-cluster">3.Controllability, or the underlying belief that worry is a way of gaining 
control and preventing negative possibilities from coming true. In 
other words, "I am glad I worried about my daughter because she 
made it home safely from her trip," or conversely, "I am worried that 
I am not worrying."</p><p class="cl-cluster">4.Negative beliefs about worry, or the belief that worry itself may drive 
you crazy, or that worrying indicates that you have lost your mind or 
are incapable of functioning.</p><p class="cl-cluster">These underlying beliefs either drive you to continue to worry (because 
worry means that "you are less likely to make mistakes," "that you are being 
responsible," and that "you are preventing negative events from coming 
true") or drive you to do things to stop yourself from worrying, such as dis tracting yourself or always being fully prepared for the next workday so 
that you won't have to worry throughout the night about not being fully 
prepared (because excessive worry during the night might "make you lose 
your mind"). Either way, these underlying beliefs perpetuate worry.</p><div id="calibre_link-58" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Behavioral Component</p><p class="cl-cluster">The thinking and physical state of being prepared for danger or a threat 
(anxiety) obviously has certain behavioral features that accompany it. Some 
of the behaviors are directly produced by high levels of physical tension. 
These include restlessness, poor concentration on other tasks, and irritability.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Other behaviors include those that are designed to lessen the amount of worrying, such as always being fully prepared for the next day at work so as to 
avoid worrying throughout the night about not being prepared, or refusing to take on a task to avoid worrying about its completion.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Other behaviors are designed to prevent the chances of negative outcomes, 
and of course, these overlap with the behaviors designed to prevent worry 
in the first place. For example, being overly prepared for the next day of 
work not only helps to eliminate worry about not being prepared, but also, 
in your mind, may help decrease the chances of being criticized at work the 
next day. The same applies to going overboard to ensure that everything 
gets done on time at work or at home. Similarly, working to have your 
house in perfect order before a social gathering at home serves not only to 
decrease your worry about the order of your house, but also, in your mind, 
decreases the chances of negative judgments from your guests.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Related to this are "safety-check" types of behaviors, designed to ensure that 
"everything is OK." These can include things such as calling your husband 
or wife at work each day to be reassured that he or she is safe, checking the 
news reports for weather conditions in the areas in which your family members are driving, and being overly protective of your children. Of course, 
these types of safety checks are common for a lot of people, but you may 
do them more frequently than others, and the immediate relief that they 
provide, unfortunately, contributes to anxiety.</p><p class="cl-cluster">As you will learn, all of the behaviors that are designed to eliminate worry 
or prevent negative events contribute to your chronic worry in the long run. 
We will help you let go of these behaviors.</p><div id="calibre_link-59" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Your Three Anxiety Components</p><p class="cl-cluster">Now that each of the components of anxiety has been described, it is time 
for you to recognize the physical symptoms, thoughts or images, and behaviors that occur when you are anxious. Remember, an initial step toward 
change is to become an objective observer of your own reactions. Using the 
Worry Records that you completed over the last week, list your most typical physical symptoms, thoughts, and behaviors. In the following example, 
when James is anxious, he is most aware of jittery legs, an upset stomach, 
and muscle tension. His thoughts are mostly related to making mistakes at 
work and losing his job, not getting everything at work done on time, and 
his future. His major behaviors include irritability with others at work and 
at home, procrastination about big tasks, and frequent reviews of his work.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Now, record the types of symptoms, thoughts, and behaviors that you most 
commonly experience when you are anxious and worried about future events 
or uncertainties. Use your record-keeping over the past week to help you. 
Remember, your physical symptoms, behaviors, and thoughts are likely to 
differ, depending on whether you are in a state of anxiety or a state of fear 
(the actual fight-or-flight response). For example, although you might feel 
jittery, tense, and irritable when you are worried about the future, the most 
noticeable symptoms when you are afraid might be a racing heart and un steadiness or faintness. Similarly, when you are worried about the future, 
your behaviors might be to work extra hard to prevent negative events 
(such as being fired from your job), whereas you might just leave or escape 
a situation when you feel very frightened. Finally, the major thought when 
you are anxious is likely to pertain to possible future events ("what if") 
whereas your strongest thoughts when you are afraid are likely to relate to 
the perception of immediate danger ("It is happening. I am about to die"). 
For this particular exercise, write down the symptoms, thoughts, and behaviors that occur when you are anxious and worried about future events.</p><div id="calibre_link-60" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

<p class="cl-cluster">The Anxiety Component Cycle</p><p class="cl-cluster">The three components of anxiety not only define the experience of anxiety, but also influence each other in a way that can increase or decrease the 
overall experience of anxiety. Let's examine the escalating cycle first. At times, 
worrisome thoughts may bring about increased physical tension, which may, 
in turn, interfere with your behavior. For example, worrying about the 
safety of your friends or family may result in agitation and restlessness to a 
level that interferes with your concentration at work. In turn, high levels of 
physical tension most likely contribute to having worrisome thoughts or 
images. This type of interaction, where one component of anxiety intensifies 
another component, is called a "positive feedback loop." Another example 
of a positive feedback loop is when worrying about receiving a negative review at work produces increased muscle tension and difficulty concentrating, 
which produce more anxious thoughts about being fired, which contribute to even higher levels of physical tension and overwhelming fatigue, which 
lead to procrastination about starting a new project at work, which intensifies worries about being fired, and the cycle goes on. Therefore, while representing separate components, the thoughts, behaviors, and physiology 
can interact in ways that actually cause further anxiety, as shown.</p><div id="calibre_link-63" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<div class="graphic"><img src="images/000008.jpg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><div id="calibre_link-64" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Let's take another example. James was at his computer programming work 
one Friday morning, anxiously worrying about renovations that were being 
made at his bed and breakfast inn. His worry had been relatively mild, until 
he overheard a co-worker talking about problems he'd had with a plumber 
in his own home. The plumber did not show up on time, and as a result, 
the kitchen sink was still clogged and would remain so until the plumber 
returned that evening. When James heard this account, he began to worry 
that the renovations to his inn would not be completed by the evening. If 
that happened, it would be a disaster because the customers who were coming for the weekend would be disappointed with the condition of the inn. 
As he continued to worry, James began to feel tense and restless. He called 
the company responsible for the renovations, but the person in charge was 
out of the office. This led James to feel even more worried, and he became 
increasingly convinced that the workers had not shown up at all. He tried 
to focus on his work, but found it very difficult to stop thinking about the 
renovations, because he was very agitated and was experiencing some stomach distress. As a result, he began to worry about others noticing him at 
work. He worried that they would think that he was not getting his work 
done. This led to other worries about being fired from his job and being in 
the horrible position of not being able to pay the bills.</p><p class="cl-cluster">In fact, most of the renovations went according to plan, and even though 
every last detail was not finished, the customers still seemed very pleased 
with the inn. As usual, the result was very different from the images of disaster that James was preoccupied with while at work. In this case, a specific 
piece of information led to worrisome thoughts and images, as well as physical tension, safety checking behaviors, task interference, and so on. Therefore, a feedback cycle was operating, whereby negative thoughts provoked 
physical tension and behaviors, which provoked more negative thoughts, 
and so on.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Now it's time for you to describe one of your own recent episodes of anxiety in the same way. What was the sequence of events? Understanding your anxiety in this way will contribute to a sense of control; by understanding 
the patterns that cause anxiety to increase, it becomes possible to interrupt 
these patterns and gain control over your anxiety. Use the following form to 
record the sequence of thoughts, behaviors, and physical symptoms for a 
recent episode of anxiety, perhaps one that you have already recorded on a 
Worry Record. Note that, on the Worry Record, you recorded your thoughts, 
symptoms, and behaviors, whereas in the Sequence of Anxiety Components 
form, you are recording the way in which one anxiety component influenced another anxiety component in positive feedback loops.</p><div id="calibre_link-65" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster"><img src="images/000088.svg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p><div id="calibre_link-66" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Just as the cycle can escalate, it can also spiral downward. Learning to interrupt an escalating cycle and turn it into a downward cycle, so that unnecessary anxiety decreases, is the basic approach taken in this program. 
For example, let's go back to the example of James. When he first began to 
worry about the renovations, he felt physically tense. If he had reassured 
himself at that point that it was more likely than not that the renovations 
would be completed, and, even if they were not finished, it would not be 
the end of the world, a very different emotional experience would have resulted. Instead of further escalation, the physical tension probably would 
have decreased, and he would have returned to focusing on his tasks at 
work. Then, the worries related to being fired from his office job would not 
have popped up at all.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Homework</p><div class="graphic"><img src="images/000009.jpg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><div class="graphic"><img src="images/000010.jpg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><p class="cl-cluster">Over the following week, pay special attention to how your worrisome thoughts and images intensify your physical tension and lead to

you continue to monitor your anxiety in the ways described. Once again, 
this helps you to develop an objective understanding of your own reactions 
and a full understanding of the triggers of your anxiety; the symptoms, 
thoughts, and behaviors most typical of your anxiety; and the positive 
feedback loops that escalate your anxiety. As we pointed out in chapter 2, 
it helps to stand outside of the bowl of gelatin rather than wallow in the 
middle of it. If you have not completed your records, we recommend that 
you spend at least a couple of days completing them and rereading the material in the last chapter before continuing.</p><p class="cl-cluster">If you did complete your records, add the number of anxiety episodes and 
the average maximum anxiety ratings to your Progress Record. Look to see 
if any patterns are developing. What are the typical events that trigger anxiety? What are your most typical thoughts and behaviors when you experience anxiety? Do you notice common themes in your worrisome thoughts, 
such as perfectionism or not wanting to make mistakes, or perhaps feeling 
responsible for everything that happens, either to yourself or to your loved ones? Which of the underlying beliefs listed in chapter 3 (perfectionism, responsibility, controllability, and negative beliefs about worry) is most relevant 
to your worry? Did you examine the sequences, or the cycling effects, among 
the components of anxiety? Did you notice ways in which your thoughts 
led to anxious behaviors or increased physical tension, which in turn, contributed to worrisome thoughts? Maybe you wake up feeling physically 
tense, and that leads you to be on the lookout for possible disasters during the 
day. Are you sometimes more aware of physical feelings, without being aware 
of obvious worries, or vice versa? Continuing to ask yourself these types of 
questions will help you gain a full and objective understanding of the nature of your anxiety reactions.</p><div id="calibre_link-68" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">How Does Normal Worry Become Abnormal Worry?</p><p class="cl-cluster">There are really two questions to be addressed in this section. First, how 
does excessive worry and anxiety develop in the first place, or "Why did I 
become a worrier?" Second, what maintains excessive worry, or "Why can't 
I control this problem?"</p><p class="cl-cluster">Causes of Abnormal Worry</p><p class="cl-cluster">Understanding the initial causes of extreme anxiety and worry is not necessary in order to benefit from treatment, but it is helpful. A full understanding 
of the causes is not necessary because the factors that cause a problem to develop are not necessarily the same as the factors that keep the problem going.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Discovering the causes of anxiety is very difficult and is the focus of a great 
deal of scientific work. We do not know all of the answers yet. However, 
the research does not suggest that generalized anxiety is a disease or a specific biological or chemical dysfunction. On the other hand, as described 
in chapter 3, biological, physiological, and chemical processes are very much 
a part of the state of anxiety when it is present. So, what causes generalized 
anxiety?</p><p class="cl-cluster">There is good evidence that biological factors contribute to anxiety. Research 
has demonstrated an inherited component to feeling anxious, excitable, or 
tense, but this does not mean that GAD is genetic. What is probably inherited is a general sensitivity, or emotionality, that can be categorized as being "uptight," "high-strung," or "excitable." This type of sensitivity is not 
always unpleasant. For example, some people tend to get emotional at weddings or sporting events, and they actually enjoy these events more when 
they do "get into it." Therefore, having sensitivity or being emotional and 
reactive to positive and negative events is not necessarily a guarantee of an 
anxiety problem. It does seem, however, that being "high-strung" may be 
one of the factors that contributes to anxiety disorders.</p><div id="calibre_link-69" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">What type of learning experiences contribute to becoming anxious? First 
is learning to view the world as a more dangerous and threatening place 
than other people do. Associated with this view of the world may be a set 
of beliefs concerning perfectionism, responsibility, and control (the underlying beliefs that make it difficult to stop worrying). That is, since threat is 
perceived to be ever-present, it makes sense that you would try to make 
everything "work" perfectly. It also makes sense that you would feel responsible for doing everything possible to prevent negative events (since, 
if you foresaw an event, but did nothing to prevent it, you would be to 
"blame") and to remain in control and on guard by worrying so that you 
can be ready to deal with dangers when they do arise, or even to prevent 
dangers. And how do we learn this? It seems that all of us, very early in life, 
develop a sense of whether we can cope with the unexpected, and sometimes 
challenging or stressful, events that we face. Healthy development during 
early childhood generates a sense that we can handle or control challenges 
and negative events, if they come along. If we do not develop this sense of 
control, perhaps due to an unfortunate series of unpleasant events in childhood or because as children we are constantly warned of the dangers that 
lurk around every corner, then we may develop a view of the world as a 
dangerous place and find ourselves always dwelling on the worst possible 
outcomes.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Remember, this type of view of the world does not, in and of itself, cause 
GAD; it just contributes to the chances of developing anxiety. Instead, a combination of biological and psychological factors is believed to explain anxiety problems.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Another feature of learning experiences that contribute to anxiety problems 
is stressors, or specific events that occur at specific points in time and trigger the development of an anxiety problem. On many occasions, patients 
seeking treatment report that they have always been somewhat more cautious than most people. In fact, being extra-prepared often led them to be more effective or productive in their functioning. However, when they left 
school, got married, had children, received a job promotion, lost a parent, 
or went through some other major positive or negative life experience, 
their anxiety intensified and became problematic. The anxiety increased 
and shifted from being a productive driving force to being a problematic, 
interfering force.</p><div id="calibre_link-70" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">So, you can see how a complex interaction of several different factors can 
account for the development of excessive anxiety. The following diagram 
shows these factors. For a complete account of the recent research on the 
nature and causes of anxiety, you may wish to read Anxiety and Its Disorders: 
The Nature and Treatment ofAnxiety and Panic, by David H.Barlow (New 
York: Guilford Press, 2002).</p><p class="cl-cluster">It is important to understand that having a higher level of emotionality or 
nervousness than others and being more likely to react strongly to life events 
is not a disease. Whether an anxiety problem develops is based on a complex interaction of the features that we already discussed: genetics and 
physiology, view of the world, and specific events that may occur. Also, it 
is important to understand that being an anxious person does not mean 
that you have some type of mental illness, but rather, it is a characteristic 
of your response that has developed over time. The sense of the world as 
being a dangerous and threatening place, the sense of responsibility, and the striving for perfectionism and control are all aspects of your response 
that can be changed.</p><div id="calibre_link-71" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Interaction of Factors Causing Anxiety</p><div class="graphic"><img src="images/000014.jpg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><div id="calibre_link-72" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Remember that anxiety and worry are normal states that actually serve a 
protective function, by preparing us for upcoming uncertainties or threatening events. During this preparation, we experience physical tension and 
a stream of thoughts aimed at problem-solving. This process is important 
to our very survival. What makes worry abnormal is when it occurs at the 
wrong time-when no real threat or danger exists, when it is excessive, and 
when it never stops.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Factors That Maintain Anxiety</p><p class="cl-cluster">Once a state of heightened anxiety occurs, high levels of tension, anxious 
thoughts and images, and anxious behaviors maintain the problem. Remember, being in a state of high anxiety means that your body is in a state of 
physical preparation (a high level of tension) and your mind is in a state of 
readiness for danger and is attempting to engage in problem-solving ("what 
if"), even though these attempts are unsuccessful, and your behaviors are 
aimed at preventing bad things from happening or minimizing worry. The 
combination of worry, increased physical tension, and cautious behavior 
can keep anxiety going in the long term in several ways. As we described in 
chapter 3, anxious thoughts and behaviors and physical tension influence 
each other in positive feedback loops so as to generate more and more anxiety. These feedback loops also have consequences for anxiety in the long 
term and therefore contribute to the maintenance of anxiety. For example, 
worrying about meeting deadlines and having everything "just right" may 
motivate you to get everything done, but thoughts of "something going 
wrong" remain in the back of your mind. These thoughts can become so 
strong and overriding that they interfere with your ability to concentrate 
on what you're doing. Then, the next time you're faced with a deadline, you 
may have less confidence in your ability to concentrate and finish the task, 
thereby influencing your anxiety over the long term.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Also, high levels of tension may interfere with effective problem-solving, and 
instead, encourage you to focus on worst-case scenarios. Instead of problemsolving, you may focus on negative events as if they are likely, when in fact, 
the probability that they will occur is very low. In addition, you may blow 
things out of proportion by thinking that something will turn out to be a disaster, when in fact, it can be managed. Consequently, you may not give 
enough time or consideration to more realistic solutions.</p><div id="calibre_link-73" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Another reason that anxiety persists in the long term is related to the underlying beliefs that were discussed in chapter 3. These beliefs motivate continued worry or behaviors that eventually lead to continued worry. These 
beliefs include perfectionism, or the notion that one should not make mistakes and that to make mistakes is a sign of incompetence; responsibility, 
or the notion that it is irresponsible to dismiss worries about the possibility of negative events; control, or the notion that negative events can be 
prevented by worrying about them; and beliefs that excessive worry will 
cause you to go crazy, which leads to behaviors designed to decrease worry 
(such as distraction) that, in turn, contribute to the continuation of worry. 
Such attempts only make the worry stronger: The more you try not to think 
about a white elephant, the more likely it is that you will think about it. 
Resistance can be a very powerful reinforcer. Instead of resisting worries, it 
is more effective to challenge them and replace them with appropriate alternatives or solutions. Rather than trying to eliminate worry through distraction or by doing things that are designed to minimize worry (such as 
staying late at work to prepare for the next day), it is better to address worries directly by questioning the evidence and generating coping alternatives 
for the worst-case scenario. These types of challenges are described in detail in chapter 6.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Tension and worries can also persist when negative events that happen to 
all of us are interpreted as further justification for worry. That is, actual 
negative events may strengthen worry in someone who is already a worrier, 
due to the belief that if negative events happen once, they are more likely 
to happen in the future, and the belief that worry can somehow lessen the 
chance of future negative events (remember the issues of responsibility and 
control that were discussed earlier). An example might be, "Since I was reprimanded by my boss, I worry about being reprimanded again, and by 
worrying about being reprimanded, it is less likely to happen." Although 
worrying can sometimes lead to problem-solving behaviors that do reduce 
the chances of negative events (for example, worry about taking an exam 
leads to extra study that results in better performance), the belief that 
worry can prevent independent negative events is wrong. Try it. See if you 
can cause the number of traffic accidents in your area to decrease as a result of your worrying about them. In other words, the act of worrying has 
little effect on whether an independent negative event occurs. Similarly, worrying that the plane in which you are traveling may crash will not affect 
the probability of the plane crashing and worrying about the safety of your 
child who is living in another state or country will not affect the probability of injury or harm to your child.</p><div id="calibre_link-74" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">A final reason someone with GAD continues to worry all the time when it 
doesn't solve any problems, and only makes things worse, relates to recent 
scientific discoveries. It seems that, if we engage in frantic, intense worry, 
our minds are so totally focused on thoughts of danger that it's not possible 
to focus on the feelings and images that underlie the rush of thoughts. In 
other words, we are thinking so hard about upcoming problems that we 
don't have time to really dwell on negative emotions in a productive way. 
This is because thinking about something and really feeling an emotion 
occupy different parts of our brains. But, letting ourselves experience emotions and feelings to the fullest is the only way for our emotions to eventually diminish. Thus, frantic worrying is a way to avoid dealing with the 
roots of the problem. The fact that this frantic worry process keeps us from 
dealing with the real problem is one of the reasons we keep doing it (even 
though we don't want to). Even though we know that the solution is to 
confront our real feelings and work through them, we constantly worry to 
avoid doing just that. One of the things you will learn to do in this program is to fully experience the images and emotions underlying your anxiety so that you can deal with them more effectively.</p><p class="cl-cluster">All of these factors contribute to the persistence of worry and tension. However, they can all be changed.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Factors That Maintain Excessive Anxiety and Worry</p><div class="graphic"><img src="images/000015.jpg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><div id="calibre_link-75" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">So far we have described (t) the intense spiral of anxiety episodes, due to 
interactions among the physical, behavioral, and cognitive components or 
response; (2) the initial causes of anxiety problems; and (3) the factors that 
maintain excessive anxiety and worry.</p><p class="cl-cluster">The Effects of Too Much Anxiety and Worry</p><p class="cl-cluster">While some anxiety can be a good thing, and even excessive anxiety, in the 
short term, can't hurt you, having generally high anxiety levels for long periods (or for many years) can take its toll. Anxiety will never make you go 
crazy, no matter how extreme, but being uptight for a long time can cause you 
to lose sleep, feel tired, have difficulty concentrating, and feel irritable. While 
these symptoms are not dangerous, they do make life less pleasant for you 
and those around you. They also lower your performance and productivity. This is why it is important to learn to control your excessive anxiety.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Long periods of excessive anxiety may affect your body. Having high levels of anxiety for long periods can increase the chance of heart disease, high 
blood pressure, diabetes, immune problems, and cancer later on in life. Stress 
and anxiety lower the functioning of your immune system and make you 
more susceptible to infectious diseases. Stress and anxiety can also interfere 
with your sexual functioning, so you may lose both your desire and your 
ability to function. There are also a number of physical problems that are 
mainly caused by high levels of chronic anxiety: irritable bowel syndrome, 
nervous stomach, frequent gas, diarrhea, ulcers, headaches, skin irritations, 
and temporomandibular joint dysfunction.</p><p class="cl-cluster">There is no need to be alarmed about these problems or to add more anxiety to your current level. Being highly anxious does not guarantee that you 
will have these diseases or problems, but anxiety can increase your chances 
of having them in the future. All of these facts mean that it is very worthwhile for you to learn to be less anxious.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Training Program Rationale: How to Learn to Be Less Anxious</p><p class="cl-cluster">This program will teach you how to change your current style of responding so that your anxiety is not excessive or chronic, although it will still be 
present in situations in which anxiety is useful. In essence, the program en tails learning new ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting physically. The 
program targets each of the three components of anxiety: behavior, physical reactions, and thoughts. You will learn how to change the kind of statements and negative predictions that you make, and particularly, how to 
control your worry. In addition, you will be taught how to decrease your 
physical symptoms. Then, you will learn how to face the fearful emotions 
that underlie your worry and how to engage in certain tasks that you currently avoid for fear of negative outcomes. These tasks are designed to prove 
your negative predictions false and to help you change your behaviors.</p><div id="calibre_link-76" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">We will begin with the methods of physical control, since methods of physical relaxation will become a natural part of your daily routine. It is essential 
to take some time each day for relaxation. You will be learning a method of 
relaxation that has proven to be very valuable for many people; it is called 
"progressive muscle relaxation." Learning relaxation techniques will decrease the level of physical tension that is contributing to the maintenance 
of your anxiety problems, as well as provide a tool for interrupting the escalating cycle during an anxiety episode.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Then, we will focus on the kinds of self-statements you make and the negative predictions that guide your feelings and behaviors. You will be taught 
methods of counteracting your negative predictions, as well as how to develop more realistic predictions that will become as powerful and automatic as your negative predictions are right now. Next, we will focus on 
identifying underlying emotions and associated catastrophic images, and 
then, through a series of structured exercises, we will help you to face those 
emotions and images so that they subside.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Next, you will do direct behavioral practice of two types. First, you will be 
taught to change your safety-checking behavior so that you learn that the 
dangers you predict are not going to happen, even if you do not check. 
Second, you will be taught to engage in activities that you may have been 
avoiding because of your negative predictions or your frantic, chronic 
worry, to learn that either nothing bad happens or that the worst that happens can be managed.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Finally, you will be taught methods of effective problem-solving to deal with 
real negative events. As a result of these procedures, you will be able to dismiss your negative thoughts because you know that they are unfounded.</p><div id="calibre_link-77" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

anxiety. So, it is really to your benefit to continue the record-keeping. In 
addition, we recommend that you do not continue until you fully understand all of the material presented in the previous chapters. If you have 
questions, either reread the section or ask your mental health professional 
for clarification. Since so much of this program is based on learning new 
principles, it is very important that you fully understand the reasons for 
everything that you will be asked to do.</p><p class="cl-cluster">From your records, what do you notice about the previous week? In particular, what are the typical themes of your worry, and what are the positive 
feedback loops among your thoughts, physical symptoms, and behaviors? 
Add the number of episodes of anxiety and average maximum anxiety rat ings to the Progress Record. Do not worry if the averages have not changed 
yet. You are still in the learning phase of this program. The application 
phase will begin with this chapter.</p><div id="calibre_link-79" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Progressive Muscle Relaxation</p><p class="cl-cluster">In the previous chapter, physical tension was described as one of the factors that both contributes to and results from worry and anxiety. For this 
reason, learning to relax physically is one pathway to interrupting the cycle 
of anxiety and worry.</p><p class="cl-cluster">People relax in many different ways. Some people sit quietly and listen to 
music, and others practice yoga or some other form of meditation. A procedure that we find to be very useful is called "progressive muscle relaxation 
training."</p><p class="cl-cluster">This method has two components: one for physical relaxation and one for 
mental relaxation. Physical relaxation is taught through a series of muscular tensing and releasing exercises. It begins with i6 different muscle groups, 
and then, with practice, decreases to eight muscle groups, and then to four 
muscle groups, before finally being reduced to relaxation in one step. Mental relaxation is taught through learning to focus your attention on the sensations that you experience during the tensing and releasing exercises. 
</p><p class="cl-cluster">Initially, the procedure takes approximately 30 minutes. As the number of 
specific muscle groups is reduced, the procedure becomes shorter. Eventually, the goal is to relax in one step. However, as with any new behavioral 
procedure, relaxation is a skill that takes considerable practice. Therefore, 
achieving one-step relaxation requires time and effort.</p><p class="cl-cluster">The advantage of the one-step method of relaxation is that it can be used 
to interrupt anxiety as soon as tension starts to build. However, the lengthier, more extensive 30-minute version of relaxation is a very useful general 
strategy for letting go of tension that has accumulated during the day. Even 
though you will learn how to shorten the relaxation procedure progressively 
so that it can become an applied skill, it will be valuable to continue to practice the longer versions as well.</p><p class="cl-cluster">As described in the last chapter, the combination of high levels of physical 
tension and negative thinking contribute to the persistence of worry and anxiety. By learning a method to reduce your level of physical tension, it will 
be easier for you to control your worrying. Relaxation should become a 
regular part of your daily schedule. Your initial response might be, "I don't 
have time to relax. There are far too many other things that have to get 
done!" This sense of time pressure only adds to your anxiety. Changing 
your schedule and taking the time to relax will not only lower physical tension, but also will teach you a very important lesson, which is that most of 
the things you believe have to get done can wait.</p><div id="calibre_link-80" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Now let's discuss the procedure itself. By the way, if you are already using 
a specific relaxation strategy that you find effective, it's not necessary for 
you to learn the procedure we describe here. Nevertheless, you should read 
through the remainder of the relaxation sections of this book to ensure that 
you are following all of the principles. Also, if you have tried one form of 
relaxation and it did not work, don't assume that it will not work this time. 
It may not have worked for a lot of reasons that you were not fully aware 
of, but that can be corrected with practice.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Initially, the exercise involves tensing the muscles, followed by releasing or 
relaxing. The tensing has two purposes. First, the tension-relaxation procedure acts like a pendulum: the further you pull it one way (tension), the 
further it will go the other way (relaxation), and therefore, relaxation is made 
easier. Second, the tensing exercises provide a strong contrast with the relaxation part of the procedure so that you can learn to discriminate very 
clearly between tension and relaxation. Sometimes tension builds gradually, without our awareness. Learning to detect the initial signs of an increase in tension will put you in a better position to use relaxation as a tool 
early on, rather than waiting for anxiety and tension to reach high levels.</p><p class="cl-cluster">The tensing part of the exercises is not intended to produce pain. In fact, 
if you experience chronic pain in any part of your body, it is best to avoid 
the tensing component for the muscles in that area; just do the relaxing 
component when you get to those muscle groups.</p><p class="cl-cluster">The procedure asks you to tense and release different muscle groups in sequence. We start with the arms and then move to the legs, stomach, chest, 
shoulders, neck, and face. During the tensing part of the exercises, you should 
tense only the specified muscle group, keeping the rest of your body relaxed. Of course, some overlap is unavoidable; for example, it is difficult to avoid tensing your lower arms when you tense your upper arms. However, 
some parts of your body can fairly easily remain relaxed as you tense other 
parts of your body; for example, it is easy to relax your face and your legs 
as you tense your arms.</p><div id="calibre_link-81" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Throughout the exercise, concentrate on the sensations produced by tensing and releasing different muscle groups. You can do this by repeatedly 
telling yourself, "Think about the feelings in my arm, feel the tension and 
tightness.... Feel the warmth of releasing the tension." Other thoughts 
may enter your mind, particularly worrisome thoughts. Don't get upset or 
try to get rid of these thoughts. Instead, gently bring your concentration 
back to the physical sensations. By redirecting your attention, you will learn 
to dismiss worrisome thoughts; that is, even though the worrisome thoughts 
may still be present, the fact that you are not giving them all of your attention and, instead, directing your attention to the physical sensations of relaxation, will mean that you are teaching yourself that those worrisome thoughts 
are not important and that you are not controlled by them.</p><p class="cl-cluster">As with the learning of any new skill, it is helpful to begin practicing in 
environments in which you will not be distracted and at times that you 
have specifically set aside for relaxation. Later on, you will be asked to practice relaxing in more distracting places, so that you can eventually use 
relaxation as a strategy wherever you are when you notice tension building. 
For the moment, however, find a quiet place where you know you will not 
be distracted or disturbed. If you have children, do the relaxation exercise 
when they are asleep, at school, or being looked after by someone else. A 
high-backed, comfortable chair that provides support for your neck is 
ideal, but lying on a bed is okay, as long as you do not fall asleep. Loosen 
tight clothing, including shoes or belts, and uncross your legs or arms. If you 
wear glasses or contact lenses, remove them before going ahead with the 
exercise.</p><p class="cl-cluster">The following exercise should be practiced every day, twice a day, for the 
next seven days. Initially, that means 30 minutes twice a day. This is necessary in order to really learn how to relax. Do not expect major changes at 
first. With practice, you will feel the effects of relaxation.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Read the following set of instructions very carefully. If possible, record the 
instructions on an audiotape. When you're ready to practice, you can follow your own taped instructions.</p><div id="calibre_link-82" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">The Relaxation Procedure</p><p class="cl-cluster">Get into a comfortable position, close your eyes, and sit quietly for a few 
seconds, taking some slow, deep breaths.</p><p class="cl-cluster">i.Build up the tension in your lower arms by making fists with your 
hands and pulling up on your wrists. If your nails are long, press 
your fingers against your palms to make fists. Feel the tension 
through your lower arms, wrists, fingers, knuckles, and hands. Focus 
on the tension. Notice the sensations of pulling, of discomfort, of 
tightness. Hold the tension (to seconds). Now, release the tension 
and let your hands and lower arms relax onto the chair or bed, with 
your palms facing down. Focus your attention on the sensations of 
relaxation in your hands and arms. Feel the release from tension. 
Relax the muscles (zo seconds), and as you relax, breathe smoothly 
and slowly from your abdomen. Each time you exhale, think the 
word "relax."</p><p class="cl-cluster">2.Now, build up the tension in your upper arms by pulling your arms 
back and in, toward your sides. Feel the tension in the back of your 
arms and radiating up into your shoulders and back. Focus on the 
sensations of tension. Hold the tension (to seconds). Now, release 
your arms and let them relax. Focus on your upper arms, and feel the 
difference compared with the tension. Your arms might feel heavy, 
warm, and relaxed. As you relax (zo seconds), breathe smoothly and 
slowly from your abdomen. Each time you exhale, think the word 
"relax."</p><p class="cl-cluster">3.Now, build up the tension in your lower legs by flexing your feet 
and pulling your toes toward your upper body. Feel the tension as it 
spreads through your feet, ankles, shins, and calves. Focus on the 
tension spreading down the back of your leg, into your foot, under 
your foot, and around your toes. Concentrate on that part of your 
body (to seconds). Now, release the tension. Let your legs relax heavily onto the chair or bed. Feel the difference in the muscles as they 
relax. Feel the release from tension, the sense of comfort, and the 
warmth and heaviness of relaxation (2o seconds). As you breathe 
smoothly and slowly, think the word "relax" each time you exhale.</p><p class="cl-cluster">4.Build up the tension in your upper legs by pulling your knees together and lifting your legs off of the bed or chair. Focus on the tightnessin your upper legs. Feel the pulling sensations from the hip 
down, and notice the tension in your legs. Focus on that part of your 
body (io seconds). Now, release the tension, and let your legs drop 
down heavily onto the chair or bed. Let the tension go away. Concentrate on the feeling of relaxation. Feel the difference in your legs. 
Focus on the feeling of comfort (20 seconds), and as you breathe 
smoothly and slowly, think the word "relax" each time you exhale.</p><div id="calibre_link-83" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">5.Now, build up the tension in your stomach by pulling your stomach 
in toward your spine very tightly. Feel the tension. Feel the tightness, 
and focus on that part of your body (io seconds). Now, let your 
stomach relax outwards. Let it go further and further. Feel the sense 
of warmth circulating across your stomach. Feel the comfort of relaxation (zo seconds). As you breathe smoothly and slowly, think the 
word "relax" each time you exhale.</p><p class="cl-cluster">6.Now, build up the tension around your chest by taking a deep breath 
and holding it. Your chest is expanded, and the muscles are stretched 
around it. Feel the tension in your chest and back. Hold your breath 
(io seconds). Now, slowly, let the air escape and breathe normally, 
letting the air flow in and out smoothly and easily. Feel the difference 
as the muscles relax compared with the tension, and think the word 
"relax" each time you exhale.</p><p class="cl-cluster">7.Imagine that your shoulders are on strings and are pulled up toward 
your ears. Feel the tension around your shoulders, radiating down 
into your back and up into your neck and the back of your head. 
Focus on this part of your body. Concentrate on the sensations 
around your neck and shoulders (to seconds), and then let your 
shoulders droop. Relax and let them droop further and further. Feel 
the sense of relaxation around your neck and shoulders. Concentrate 
on the sensation of relaxation (zo seconds) in this part of your body. 
As you breathe smoothly and slowly, think the word "relax" each 
time you exhale.</p><p class="cl-cluster">8.Build up the tension around your neck by pressing the back of your 
neck toward the chair or bed and pulling your chin down toward 
your chest. Feel the tightness around the back of your neck spreading 
up into the back of your head. Focus on the tension (io seconds). 
Now, release the tension, letting your head rest comfortably against 
the bed or chair. Concentrate on the relaxation (zo seconds), and feel the difference from the tension. As you breathe smoothly and slowly, 
think the word "relax" each time you exhale.</p><div id="calibre_link-84" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">9.Build up the tension around your mouth, jaw, and throat by clenching 
your teeth and forcing the corners of your mouth back into a forced 
smile (io seconds). Feel the tightness, and concentrate on the sensations. Then, release the tension, letting your mouth drop open and the 
muscles around your throat and jaw relax. Concentrate on the difference 
in the sensations in that part of your body (zo seconds). As you breathe 
smoothly and slowly, think the word "relax" each time you exhale.</p><p class="cl-cluster">to.Build up the tension around your eyes by squeezing your eyes tightly 
shut for a few seconds, and then releasing. Then, let the tension 
around your eyes slide away. Feel the difference as the muscles relax 
(zo seconds). As you breathe smoothly and slowly, think the word 
"relax" each time you exhale.</p><p class="cl-cluster">ii.Build up the tension across your lower forehead by frowning, pulling 
your eyebrows down and toward the center. Feel the tension across 
your forehead and the top of your head. Concentrate on the tension 
(to seconds), and then release, smoothing out the wrinkles and letting your forehead relax. Feel the difference as you relax (zo seconds). As you breathe smoothly and slowly, think the word "relax" 
each time you exhale.</p><p class="cl-cluster">12.Build up the tension across your upper forehead by raising your eyebrows as high as you can. Feel the wrinkling and pulling sensations 
across your forehead and the top of your head. Hold the tension (io 
seconds), and then relax, letting your eyebrows rest and the tension 
leave. Concentrate on the sensations of relaxation, and feel the difference in comparison to tension. As you breathe smoothly and slowly, 
think the word "relax" each time you exhale.</p><p class="cl-cluster">13.Now your whole body is feeling relaxed and comfortable. As you feel 
yourself becoming even more relaxed, count from one to five. One, 
letting all of the tension leave your body. Two, sinking further and 
further into relaxation. Three, feeling more and more relaxed. Four, 
feeling very relaxed. Five, feeling deeply relaxed. As you spend a few 
minutes in this relaxed state, think about your breathing. Feel the 
cool air as you breathe in and the warm air as you breathe out. Your 
breathing is slow and regular. Every time you breathe out, think the word "relax" (z minutes). Now, count backward from five, gradually 
feeling yourself become more alert and awake. Five, feeling more 
awake. Four, coming out of the relaxation. Three, feeling more alert. 
Two, opening your eyes. One, sitting up.</p><div id="calibre_link-85" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Once you learn to do this set of exercises, it is very possible that you will 
lower your heart rate and blood pressure. For that reason, do not stand up 
quickly afterward. Now, practice the exercise.</p><p class="cl-cluster">After going through the full set of tensing and releasing exercises, evaluate 
your experience. Were there any parts of your body that were difficult to 
relax? For very tense parts of your body, it may help to tense and release 
several times. Were you able to focus your attention? Remember that equally 
important as physical relaxation is mental relaxation, or learning to shift 
your attention away from worrisome thoughts and onto the physical sensations associated with the tension and relaxation exercises. If other thoughts 
enter your mind, let them pass, and redirect your attention to the physical 
sensations of relaxation. It doesn't matter if the worrisome thoughts remain in the back of your mind-you are teaching yourself that those worrisome thoughts do not deserve your full attention.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Did you feel anxiety during the procedure? You may experience an initial 
increase in anxiety as you follow the relaxation exercises, for a number of 
reasons. Unusual sensations, such as a floating sensation or a sinking feeling, sometimes occur as a result of deep relaxation, and these sensations 
may produce anxiety, although they are normal and harmless. Sometimes 
the sense of "letting go" is disturbing initially. Again, this may take some 
getting used to, especially if you usually tend to be on edge, vigilant, and 
ready for any possibility. "Letting go" will feel unfamiliar at first, and perhaps a little threatening. However, with practice, you will learn that negative events are not more likely to occur, just because you allow yourself to 
relax. Another reason that relaxation will sometimes increase anxiety is that 
you may be worrying about things that you should be doing while you're 
attempting to relax. In this case, practice dismissing these thoughts and 
shifting your attention back to the sensations of tensing and relaxing your 
muscles. If you did become anxious as a result of the relaxation technique, 
you should continue practicing the exercise regardless. With repetition, 
your anxiety will decrease and you will feel the true effects of relaxation.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Keep a record of your relaxation practice on the Relaxation Record so that 
you can evaluate your progress. Use a new Relaxation Record for each week over the next several weeks. On the record, note the level of relaxation that 
you achieve by the end of the exercise (on a o- to ioo-point scale, where 
o = no relaxation and ioo = excellent relaxation). Also, rate your average 
degree of concentration during the procedure (using a o- to too-point scale, 
where o = no concentration and too = excellent concentration). Remember, concentration refers to focusing on the sensations of tension and relaxation. The Relaxation Record lists two practices for each day. Obviously, the 
goal is for the ratings of relaxation and concentration to increase with practice. If they do not increase, consider the possibilities listed earlier; perhaps 
you're trying too hard to relax, maybe you're becoming frustrated because 
you are thinking about too many other things that "should" get done, or 
perhaps you are uncomfortable with the idea of "letting go."</p><div id="calibre_link-86" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">After you have practiced the relaxation procedure for seven days and are able 
to achieve at least moderate relaxation (at least 50 on the o- to ►oo-point 
scale), move to the eight-muscle-group procedure (described later) for one 
of your two daily practices. That is, for one of your daily practices, continue to use the 16-muscle-group procedure, and use the eight-muscle-group 
procedure for the other one. On the other hand, if you are experiencing 
difficulty relaxing, or if you have not practiced enough, continue to use the 
16-muscle-group procedure for both daily practices for another seven days.</p><p class="cl-cluster">The end goal is to achieve one-step relaxation. The first move toward that 
goal is the eight-muscle-group exercise, which is the same as the i6-musclegroup procedure, except that certain muscles are excluded. We suggest the 
following muscle groups for the eight-muscle-group procedure: (t) arms, 
combining lower and upper arms; (2) legs, combining lower and upper leg's; 
(3) stomach; (4) chest; (5) shoulders; (6) neck; (7) eyes; and (8) forehead 
(either upper or lower). However, if another area of your body typically 
becomes very tense, then replace one of the recommended muscle groups 
with that one. Use the same tensing and relaxing procedures, focusing your 
attention on the sensations, and progressing from one muscle group to another. During each relaxation phase, repeat the word "relax" as you exhale. 
Eventually, that word will become a strong cue, or trigger, for relaxation. 
Count from t to 5 to become more relaxed, relax, and breathe slowly for a 
couple of minutes. Then count backward from 5 to i as you gradually return to an alert state. As before, practice the eight-muscle-group relaxation 
procedure, daily, and keep a record of your practices on the Relaxation 
Record. Monitoring will provide feedback for yourself and anyone you're 
working with. An outline of the relaxation procedures is shown.</p><div id="calibre_link-87" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

some of the difficulties that can arise with relaxation, and we summarize 
them and other common difficulties in this section:</p><p class="cl-cluster">i.Frustration and rushing. Sometimes, frustration develops as a result 
of not feeling the immediate effects of relaxation or from trying to 
"squeeze" in a relaxation practice in between many other tasks. To 
manage this frustration, remember that it would be rare for anyone 
to feel the effects of relaxation immediately; practice effects build 
slowly. Also, trying to fit relaxation in between other tasks that you 
believe must get done only intensifies the tension, and will almost 
guarantee that the procedure will not be relaxing. Set aside a specific 
time to relax, and be sure to give yourself plenty of time. Remember, 
some of the things that you feel should get done immediately probably 
can wait.</p><p class="cl-cluster">z.Concentration. Sometimes keeping one's mind on the task, particularly for the full 30 minutes, is difficult. However, it is important to 
let go of other thoughts, images, or worries that enter your mind. 
Simply tell yourself to concentrate on what you're feeling, as if you 
were giving a running commentary on your physical experiences.</p><p class="cl-cluster">3.Increased anxiety. As mentioned earlier, you may experience anxiety 
while attempting to relax. Sometimes this is due to feeling out of 
control, or letting down one's guard, and sometimes it is related to 
feeling new, and perhaps troublesome, sensations (such as a sensation offloating). Remember that these sensations, which may seem odd 
to you, are completely normal. Also, remember that it is okay to let 
down your guard. You are not at risk for more negative events just by 
being more relaxed.</p><div id="calibre_link-90" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">4.Falling asleep. Sometimes people fall asleep when they practice relaxing. This does not help you to learn an applied skill, and so it should 
be avoided as much as possible. Practice the relaxation exercises at 
times when you are not tired.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Homework</p><div class="graphic"><img src="images/000022.jpg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><div class="graphic"><img src="images/000023.jpg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><p class="cl-cluster">Continue to monitor your levels of anxiety, using the Worry Event

one or two weeks ago. Add the number of anxiety episodes you've had per 
week and the average maximum anxiety rating to your Progress Record. 
Has the practice of relaxation influenced your daily levels of anxiety? Has 
the number of anxiety episodes changed, or have your maximum anxiety 
ratings decreased?</p><p class="cl-cluster">What about your practice of relaxation? Were you able to practice twice almost every day? If not, evaluate the reasons. Some of the more commonly 
reported reasons for not practicing include: (i) being too busy or unexpectedly being faced with many tasks that were not anticipated; (2) not believing 
that the relaxation exercise would actually reduce anxiety; and (3) feeling 
frustrated because the relaxation exercise did not produce an immediate sense 
of overall calmness. If you did not practice relaxation because you were too busy, remember that a sense of time pressure and trying to get everything 
done at once is likely to contribute to ongoing anxiety. The extent to which 
that pressure is necessary (does everything really have to get done immediately?) will be addressed in this and the next few chapters. At the very least, 
however, the feeling that you do not have enough time in the day to get 
everything done is probably a good sign that, for you, it is important to 
take time out to relax. If you did not practice relaxing because you were 
doubtful about whether it would decrease your anxiety, remember that any 
new technique should not be judged until it has been given a fair trial. We 
included this technique because many people have found it to be very helpful in reducing their anxiety. If you stopped practicing relaxation because 
the exercise did not lower your levels of anxiety immediately, remember that 
relaxation is a skill that requires practice. Do not expect it to be effective 
immediately. Continue to practice, and you will feel the effects gradually.</p><div id="calibre_link-92" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Relaxation Practice</p><p class="cl-cluster">If you have not already started the eight-muscle-group relaxation procedure, do so for the next week (see chapter 5 for instructions). If you have 
practiced the eight-muscle-group procedure with good results (that is, you 
are able to achieve at least a moderate level of relaxation and a moderate 
level of concentration during the exercises), then progress to the four-musclegroup procedure that is described next.</p><p class="cl-cluster">The four-muscle-group procedure uses the same principles as the sixteenand 8-muscle-group procedures, except that fewer muscles are targeted. 
Research shows that the same general body relaxation effects occur with the 
four-muscle-group procedure, after enough practice with the i6- and 8muscle-group procedures. The four muscle groups that we recommend include the abdomen, chest, shoulders, and forehead. Of course, you may add 
other muscle groups or replace these muscles with other muscle groups in 
which you experience a lot of tension. As before, tense and release each 
muscle group, pairing the relaxation phase with the word "relax" on each 
exhalation. Then deepen the relaxation state by counting from i to 5, focus 
on your breathing for several minutes, and then count backward from 5 to 
i. Review the outline in chapter 5 to remind yourself of the steps of relaxation. As before, we recommend that you practice the shortened procedure 
(four-muscle-group procedure) once a day, while continuing to practice 
the 16-muscle-group procedure (for the full 30 minutes) once a day also. In this way, you will achieve two goals. First, you are moving closer and closer 
to a one-step method of relaxation that you can use as soon as you notice tension and anxiety building. Second, you will establish relaxation as a regular 
part of your daily schedule. Remember to record your degree of relaxation 
and concentration for every time you practice, using the Relaxation Record.</p><div id="calibre_link-93" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Introduction to Changing Anxious Thinking</p><p class="cl-cluster">Now that you have started to learn a method of controlling physical tension, 
it's time to learn how to change anxious patterns of thinking. Thoughts 
play a major role in how different emotional states are experienced. In this 
case, we are most concerned with the particular thoughts that contribute 
to anxiety and worry.</p><p class="cl-cluster">The following example shows how beliefs (or thoughts) can influence our 
behavior and emotional states. Picture yourself walking with friends through 
a dense forest. Let's say that your walk begins very pleasantly, as you enjoy 
the unusual wildlife and plants and the sounds of birds in the trees above. 
You feel relaxed and comfortable as you explore the scenery around you. 
Then, one of your friends tells you that that he thought he saw a poisonous 
snake. Now you believe that a dangerous snake is crawling in the grass. 
Rustling sounds that you had ignored before take on a very different meaning, and become the focus of your attention. You begin to move more cautiously, as images of the snake biting you without warning race through 
your mind. You think about ways of getting out of the forest and reaching 
safety. Your heart rate and breathing rate increase, because your body is in 
a state of preparation or readiness for when the snake appears.</p><p class="cl-cluster">This example shows how perceived danger (thoughts of the poisonous snake) 
can have a dramatic effect. Such thoughts naturally lead us to become very 
tense, on guard for anything that we believe might signal danger (such as 
rustling sounds). We also look for safety. These reactions would have occurred, regardless of whether a snake was actually in the grass, as long as one 
believed that the snake was nearby.</p><p class="cl-cluster">By extension, it is easy to see how worry and physical tension can result 
from viewing negative events as being likely to occur. For example, if you 
were concerned that your husband or wife might he injured or killed in a 
car accident on the way home from work, then you would feel tense, be on 
guard, listen to news reports about road conditions and car accidents, wait by the phone in case the police try to reach you, and stop your usual activities until you are assured of his or her safety.</p><div id="calibre_link-94" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">The key question is whether your judgment of danger or threat is valid. The 
actual risk is an empirical issue, one that needs to be examined by looking 
at the facts. If you discover that your worries are not fully supported by 
facts, you can reevaluate and discount the worries. In this way, the associated anxiety will decrease. Questioning the evidence, in many cases, will result in the recognition that your worries are unfounded.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Why do you worry about events for which there is little or no evidence? 
One reason might be a tendency to view the world as dangerous, as we discussed in chapter 4. That is, it becomes a habit to think of the things that 
could go wrong. Another reason is that the more physically tense you feel, 
the more likely it is that you will have worrisome thoughts about negative 
events, which in turn generate more physical tension, and so on. These are 
the positive feedback loops we described in chapter 3. Another reason is 
the belief that, if a worrisome thought or negative image occurs, then it must 
be taken seriously rather than dismissed; this, too, is likely to contribute to 
worrying about events for which there is little direct evidence.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Remember, we have described worry as an attempt at problem-solving because of a sense of perceived risk or danger. However, instead of constructively solving the problem, a person who worries excessively sees only negative outcomes. Along with evaluating whether the negative event you are 
worried about is a real possibility, it is important to develop a set of alternatives or problem-solving solutions, in case the negative outcomes occur.</p><p class="cl-cluster">To illustrate these strategies, let's consider the earlier description of worrying that your husband or wife will be injured or die on the way home from 
work. First, examine the evidence concerning the possibility that your spouse 
will be involved in a car accident at that point in time. Assuming that your 
spouse has a good driving record, and considering the number of accidents 
relative to the number of people driving on any given day, the real probability of your spouse being involved in an accident may be very low, in which 
case your worry is out of proportion to the evidence. Second, to develop 
alternative solutions to the worst possible outcome, picture the worst happening and then consider ways of coping. Although this is easier to do with 
less significant events, such as making a mistake at work, than with more 
significant events, such as the loss of a spouse, the principles remain the same. 
Even under the worst circumstances, there is something that can be done.</p><div id="calibre_link-95" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">General Principles for Changing Your Anxious Thinking (Self-Statement Training)</p><div id="calibre_link-96" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">There are several basic principles for self-statement training.</p><p class="cl-cluster">i.First, challenging your negative thoughts does not mean just "positive thinking." You will not need to replace all of your negative 
thoughts with positive thoughts. Positive thinking is just as inaccurate as negative thinking. Instead, you will examine all of the evidence available to you, in an effort to balance your thinking and interpretations by using a realistic perspective. Sometimes negative 
events do happen, and therefore, positive thinking can be unadaptive 
and get in the way of problem-solving. However, negative events 
probably occur less often than you are predicting, and with fewer 
negative consequences than you are imagining.</p><p class="cl-cluster">z.Worrisome thoughts and images tend to become habitual and almost 
automatic. For example, a woman who was treated at our clinic reported that she always made sure that her house was clean and tidy 
by mid-morning, just in case friends or neighbors dropped by unexpectedly. It was not until she asked herself why it was important 
to have a "perfect" house that she realized that she automatically assumed that people would disapprove of her if her house wasn't in 
"perfect" order. Observing your own behaviors will help you to discover your underlying beliefs and assumptions.</p><p class="cl-cluster">3.Finally, although beliefs and self-statement patterns can become habitual, they are not impossible to change. With the right kind of 
effort and experience, we can change our views and beliefs about the 
world and ourselves just as we can change our religious beliefs or our 
language. Of course, this type of change takes practice and effort.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Beginning to Change Your Anxious Thinking (Self-Statement Analysis)</p><p class="cl-cluster">As a first step, it is essential to know exactly what it is that you tell yourself 
in different situations. The more specifically you can describe your thoughts, 
the easier it will be to correct or challenge your assumptions.</p><p class="cl-cluster">For example, simply stating, "I am worried about my child getting sick," 
is not specific enough. Instead, ask yourself about the details of the worrisome thought. What do you think might happen if your child were to become sick? Do you think your child might die or be disabled for life? Do you worry that his or her sickness means that you have failed as a parent? 
Do you worry that his or her sickness would be unbearable? The following 
is a description of how a therapist is helping a client, Joan, to describe her 
thoughts and worries more specifically:</p><div id="calibre_link-97" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Therapist: You said that you are constantly worried about others watching you at work. What is it that you're worried that they might 
see? And what leads you to assume that they're watching you?</p><p class="cl-cluster">Joan: I feel like they're watching to see that I'm doing everything that 
I'm supposed to be doing... that I'm not making mistakes.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Therapist: What kind of mistakes?</p><p class="cl-cluster">Joan: Well, for example, typing errors and wasting time retyping 
letters over and over again.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Therapist: Do you often retype letters over and over again?</p><p class="cl-cluster">Joan: No, actually, believe it or not, I'm a pretty good typist. I 
guess it's just that I worry that if I did make a mistake, they 
would see it.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Therapist: And what if they did notice that you made a mistake? 
Then what?</p><p class="cl-cluster">Joan: Well, I would worry that they might tell my boss. 
</p><p class="cl-cluster">Therapist: Go on. What next?</p><p class="cl-cluster">Joan: Well, my boss would either keep an eye on me continually 
or ask me to leave, and then I'd be without a job. I don't 
want to lose my job.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Therapist: So, the bottom line for why you're concerned that others are 
watching you is that you could be fired. Anyone who believed 
that they were about to lose their job would most likely feel 
some anxiety. We need to examine whether the evidence is 
consistent with you being fired, such as whether your colleagues really are watching you, what they would actually do 
if they did notice a mistake, and what your boss would actually do if someone mentioned that you had made a mistake.</p><p class="cl-cluster">As an exercise, choose three to four examples from your Worry Records over 
the past two weeks. Now, think back to those events, and read the anxious 
thoughts that you recorded. Can you expand on those thoughts and pro vide a more detailed description of what you thought might happen or what 
you were worried about? Ask yourself the kind of questions that the therapist asked Joan. What, specifically, did you think could have happened? In 
the following example, Joan describes her worries about her boyfriend, Rob.</p><div id="calibre_link-98" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">When Rob didn't call me last night, I thought it was because he didn't 
like me anymore, or that I wasn't good enough for him. I thought 
that it was the end of our relationship, and that I would never see him 
again. Then I'd have to explain to all my friends what happened. My 
friends would feel sorry for me, and that would make me feel even 
worse, because they would think of me as someone who is never going 
to be in a stable relationship. What is even worse is that I think they 
might he right. I'm never going to meet someone who really cares for me.</p><p class="cl-cluster">As you can see, Joan is not just worried that her boyfriend doesn't like her, 
but that she will never meet anyone and that her friends will judge her to 
be incapable of ever meeting anyone. Notice how Joan assumed the worst 
and did not consider possible alternatives for why her boyfriend didn't call 
her. Perhaps he was tired, or upset with her, or out with friends, none of 
which necessarily means the end of the relationship. Also notice how Joan 
then extended her worry from the end of this relationship to never having 
a relationship. That sounds like jumping to conclusions. Similarly, her worry 
that her friends would judge her poorly if her relationship with Bob ended 
sounds like another example of jumping to conclusions.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Judgments of Risk</p><p class="cl-cluster">Errors in judgment tend to occur whenever someone is in a state of high 
anxiety. First, we tend to overestimate the likelihood of negative events 
happening. Second, we tend to view the consequences of negative events 
as being catastrophic and unmanageable. In short, we think the worst. Of 
course, as you probably understand by now, this type of error in judgment 
only increases our anxiety. So, the very first step in correcting your thinking is to recognize that whenever you feel anxious, you are probably overestimating, catastrophizing, or both.</p><p class="cl-cluster">In this chapter, we focus on the first error in judgment, which is to overestimate the likelihood of negative events or jump to conclusions. In the 
next lesson, we focus on catastrophizing, or blowing things out of proportion. A good example of overestimation was reported in a study in England some years ago (Butler &amp; Mathews, 1983). The researchers assessed a group 
of university students one month before and one day before a major exam. 
Each time, the students were asked to judge the likelihood that they would 
fail the exam. Interestingly, despite having a full month to study and prepare, many of the students rated the possibility of failure as much higher 
one day before the exam compared with one month earlier. The students 
overestimated the chance of failure because they were more anxious the day 
before the exam.</p><div id="calibre_link-99" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Overestimating the risk means jumping to conclusions about a particular 
event, and believing that it will happen, even though the actual odds are very 
low. From the earlier example, we could say that Joan was not likely to be 
fired although she felt as if it were a strong possibility. She was overlooking 
the fact that she was a good typist and other people were probably not evaluating her in the way that she assumed. Similarly, the likelihood that Joan 
would never meet anyone who really cared for her, or that her friends would 
judge her incapable of sustaining a relationship, was not supported by the 
evidence. Joan had just jumped to those conclusions.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Go back to the examples that you chose from your Worry Records over the 
last couple of weeks. Were any of those episodes of anxiety related to overestimating the likelihood of negative events? Were you judging something 
to be a high probability, only to find that it did not occur? This will be very 
apparent if you typically worry about the same thing over and over, yet it 
has never happened. Have you worried about your children being kidnapped, 
and how many times has that happened? Have you worried about missing appointments, and how many times has that happened? Have you worried 
about your neighbors being unfriendly to you because your house was untidy, and how many times has that happened? Have you worried about being 
fired, and how many times has that happened? Have you worried about your 
vacations being a total disaster, and how many times has that happened?</p><p class="cl-cluster">Your Doubts about Probabilities</p><p class="cl-cluster">Typically, people have several doubtful responses when asked to reconsider 
the probabilities in this way. However, these doubts only keep the worry 
going. The following are the most typical doubts:</p><p class="cl-cluster">"Even though it hasn't happened in the past, it could still happen." This type 
of thinking is one of the reasons why repeated disconfirmation (repeated evidence to the contrary) does not change worrying. For example, Joan may 
have worried about being fired every day for the past six months, despite 
the fact that no one has ever told her that she makes too many mistakes, and 
even though her boss has always given her positive reviews. Why haven't 
these disconfirming pieces of evidence prevented Joan from worrying about 
the possibility of being fired? Most likely, it's because she continues to tell 
herself that, "There is always a first time, and today could be the day."</p><div id="calibre_link-100" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">By believing that "it could still happen," you have thrown out all of the evidence and assumed that the probability of the negative event is high, without any valid reason. By telling yourself that the chance of being run over 
by a car when crossing the road is one in a million, but today could be that 
one in a million chance, mentally, you have inflated the chances of yourself being hit for no good reason.</p><p class="cl-cluster">`Negative events have not happened yet because I have always managed to prevent them. I always keep close watch on my children, I always make sure I get 
everything done on time, and I am always early for my appointments. "As another example, you might think, "The reason why my neighbors have not 
rejected me is because my house is always clean." These examples represent 
the mistaken thought that your worry and anxious behaviors have actually 
prevented negative events.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Instead of realizing that the negative event is probably not going to happen, the tendency is to assume that the only reason why negative events have 
not occurred is because of your extra care and worry. Therefore, the extra 
behavioral cautions that you take convince you that negative events are 
very likely and must be prevented. In other words, your careful and safetychecking behaviors interfere with learning that your worries may not reflect the true situation. At the very least, you must realize that you do not 
know what the real risk is because you have never allowed the situation to 
arise (because you have always taken extra care to ensure that it does not). 
You can discover the real risks by testing what happens when you do not 
carry out your usual anxious, safety-checking behaviors. For example, you 
could test what happens if you do not clean your house before inviting a 
guest over, or what happens if you arrive exactly on time, or even a little 
late, for an appointment. This is the focus of chapter 9.</p><p class="cl-cluster">"But I have had bad things happen to me before, and I don't want anything 
like that to happen again, so by worrying, I can prepare myself for the worst 
and be ready for it." When a negative event has indeed happened (maybe 
you were fired, or maybe a family member came down with an illness, or maybe your decision about a new car yielded more problems than you expected), it is important to return to probabilities and ways of coping. First, 
the fact that a negative event has happened does not necessarily mean that 
your chances of it happening again, or of other negative events happening, 
have increased. It is important to realize that negative events happen to everyone, and worrying will not necessarily prevent them from happening to you. 
Instead, focus on ways of coping when they do occur.</p><div id="calibre_link-101" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">"Because I think about my children being kidnapped, then they could be kidnapped." This is called "thought-action fusion," or the tendency to confuse a 
thought with reality. Obviously, every day, we have many thoughts about different possibilities and events. The occurrence of these thoughts does not mean 
that they are important or that they will influence what actually happens.</p><p class="cl-cluster">What Are the Real Odds?</p><p class="cl-cluster">The first strategy for dealing with overestimation is to question the evidence for probability judgments. The general format for this strategy is to 
remind yourself that your thoughts are guesses, not facts, and that your interpretations represent one of many possible interpretations of given object or event. Next, question the evidence for a probability judgment. This 
involves asking the following questions: What are the real odds of this happening? Has this ever happened before? What is the evidence to suggest 
that it will not happen? For example, what are the real odds that my neighbors will think I am a slob if my house is not perfectly clean?</p><p class="cl-cluster">Consider all of the facts and evidence before making a prediction about the 
likelihood of an event. For example, you may think that your boss is upset 
with you because he did not greet you this morning, and fail to take into 
account your boss's own stresses. Similarly, you may assume that making a 
single mistake is catastrophic, and fail to realize that almost everyone makes 
mistakes occasionally.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Consider whether you are making negative predictions on the basis of a very 
limited set of past examples. For example, you may assume that you will 
be criticized for your performance on a particular task at work, when in the 
past, the reviews of your work were generally positive.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Consider whether you are confusing low probabilities with high probabilities, or acting and feeling as if negative outcomes are certainties, rather than possibilities. Remember, you may be able to list an array of possible negative outcomes, but that does not mean that those outcomes will come true.</p><div id="calibre_link-102" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">The second strategy is to generate alternative interpretations that are based 
on facts and evidence. Use a pie chart to show alternative interpretations 
for your particular overestimation. Generate as many interpretations as you 
can, listing your one initial negative interpretation as one piece of the pie 
chart, as in the following example, which shows alternative interpretations 
regarding buying a new car.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Now, after considering the facts and considering alternative explanations 
or possibilities (using a pie chart), for the three to four examples from your 
Worry Records over the past couple of weeks, rate the probability of your 
initial negative interpretation on a o- to too-point scale (o = it will never 
happen; too = it will definitely happen).</p><p class="cl-cluster">The third strategy for countering probability overestimates is to conduct 
mini-experiments that will gather data and provide evidence that disconfirms your misappraisals. Experiments are designed in such a way that spe cific outcomes can be tested by the results. It is easiest to use extra-cautious 
behaviors as a way of testing hypotheses. For example, if you typically call 
your spouse twice a day to check his or her safety, then the hypothesis to 
be tested is whether he or she is safe, even if you call only once a day; or if 
you typically avoid looking your boss in the eye for fear of being reprimanded, then the hypothesis to test is whether you are reprimanded if you 
look at him directly. The hypothesis being tested is not related to the level 
of emotional distress in a situation (such as how anxious you will feel when 
you establish eye contact with your boss), but is about independent outcomes (such as the likelihood of being reprimanded). We will be focusing 
on these mini-experiments in chapter 9.</p><div id="calibre_link-103" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

changes. In particular, if the number of anxious episodes or the level of 
maximum of anxiety has decreased, think of changes in your level of physical tension or your thoughts or behaviors that may have contributed to such 
decreases. Were there any events that you responded to differently than you 
would have responded before, and if so, what was different? For example, 
was a worry about the well-being of your family easier to dismiss because 
you recognized that you were overestimating the risk? Becoming aware of the reasons for changes in your anxiety level will help you to know what to 
concentrate on as you continue with the program.</p><div id="calibre_link-108" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Did you keep records of your anxious thoughts, the evidence, and the realistic probability for every anxiety episode that occurred? Were you able to 
identify your thoughts as specifically as possible by continuing to ask yourself questions until you reached the bottom line, or your most feared negative event? If not, do so now. For each bottom line feared negative event, 
think of all of the evidence available for and against its probability, consider 
alternative possibilities using a pie chart, and then rate the realistic probability using a o- to ioo-point scale. Remember, thinking or feeling that a 
particular event might happen does not count as evidence. Using thoughts 
and feelings as evidence is a common error. Do not base your o- to toopoint rating on what you feel, but instead, base it on the evidence. We will 
spend more time discussing self-statements in this chapter.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Did you practice your relaxation exercise? Did you keep track of your levels 
of relaxation and concentration on the Relaxation Record? If you did not 
practice, think of reasons why and make corrections for the coming week. 
Remember, the benefit that you will receive from these exercises is based 
on how much you practice.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Relaxation</p><p class="cl-cluster">By this time, you should be regularly practicing the sixteen-muscle-group 
procedure, as well as either the eight- or the four-muscle-group procedure. 
If your relaxation ratings are below 50, or if your concentration levels are 
low, consider what could account for your difficulty. As we described in the 
previous chapters, typical reasons for low relaxation ratings are interruptions, fatigue, treating the relaxation exercise as a burden, trying too hard 
to relax, and an inadequate amount of time for relaxation because of the 
sense that there are too many other things to do. One of the benefits of relaxation training is that, by allowing yourself to let go of all other responsibilities and worries for a short period, you will learn to physically relax. 
You will also learn that some of the things that you believe must get done 
right now can actually wait, and also that relaxation does not lead to more 
negative events.</p><p class="cl-cluster">If you have successfully mastered the four-muscle-group procedure, it is time 
to move on to recall-relaxation. Instead of tensing the muscles before relaxing them, you will now relax the muscles simply through the power of concentration and recall. For the four major muscle groups that you have targeted 
up until now (probably the abdomen, chest, shoulders, and forehead), 
concentrate on each one in turn, and let the tension go as you think about 
what it feels like to relax each particular area of your body. As you breathe 
out, think the word "relax," and let go of the tension in each of the four 
major muscle groups. As you concentrate on your abdomen, think of your 
stomach muscles letting go, and feel the warmth of relaxation as your abdomen relaxes. As you concentrate on your chest, feel the air move in and 
out smoothly, as you inhale and exhale. Think about your shoulders, and 
as you let them droop, think of the sense of release from tension and the 
warmth and comfort of relaxation. Similarly, as you concentrate on your 
forehead, think about the feeling of release from tension as you smooth out 
the wrinkles. Allow yourself approximately five minutes to concentrate 
and relax while maintaining a pattern of slow, regular breathing, repeating 
the word "relax" silently to yourself each time you exhale. Continue to repeat the word "relax" as you exhale, to instill a sense of relaxation. This will 
be your exercise for the next week. For the moment, continue to practice 
this procedure in a quiet, comfortable location. Soon, you will move on to 
relaxing in more distracting and uncomfortable locations, so that relaxation becomes a portable skill or one that you could apply almost any, time 
in a variety of situations.</p><div id="calibre_link-109" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

felt anxious, and became frustrated with it, or with yourself, because it didn't 
work. Because you are still learning to use relaxation, it is likely that it may 
not work well in more difficult situations. To expect to use relaxation effec tively at times of high anxiety at this point would be the same as asking a 
pilot to make an emergency landing without having practiced all of the 
emergency procedures. Training is essential, and training in more and more 
difficult situations will occur over the next few weeks.</p><div id="calibre_link-110" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Thinking the Worst</p><p class="cl-cluster">Catastrophizing</p><p class="cl-cluster">Earlier, we talked about the basic principles of self-statements and introduced the notion of overestimating the risk, or assuming that negative events 
are very likely to happen, when in fact, the real probability is low. Overestimating the likelihood of a negative event increases anxiety, because anxiety is a response to the perception of threat or of negative events. We discussed the various ways in which overestimating the risk can continue, despite 
disconfirming evidence (see the section in chapter 6 that refers to "your 
doubts about probabilities"). If you do not recall the information from the 
last chapter, or are confused about the concept of overestimating the risk 
and how to correct it by questioning the real odds, we recommend that you 
reread the previous chapter before continuing.</p><p class="cl-cluster">In addition to overestimating the risk, anxiety is associated with a tendency to 
view impending events with a sense of catastrophe or disaster. "Catastrophizing" means blowing things out of proportion, or thinking the worst. Statements such as, "That would be terrible," "I could not live through that," or 
"I could never cope with that," give a sense of being unable to cope. Catastrophizing can occur while you are thinking about events that are likely to 
happen or events that are unlikely to happen. For example, one might catastrophize about others noticing a particular symptom of distress or anxiety 
that is indeed noticeable, such as blushing or trembling. An example might be, 
"They will think I'm really weak and incompetent. I would never be able to 
face them again." This is an example of catastrophizing an event that is likelya visible symptom of anxiety. Or, one might catastrophize about others noticing a particular symptom of distress or anxiety that is not really noticeable at 
all, such as an upset stomach. An example might be, "They will know how 
bad I'm feeling and how uncomfortable my stomach feels, and they'll think 
I'm a real idiot." This is an example of catastrophizing an unlikely event.</p><div id="calibre_link-111" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Another type of catastrophizing is jumping to an extreme conclusion from 
an unimportant event. Some examples are, "If my house is not in perfect 
order, then I am no good," "If my children argue with each other, then it 
must mean that I have failed as a parent," and "If I make a mistake at work, 
then I am not right for this position." This type of catastrophizing is particularly relevant for those who find themselves striving for perfection and 
worrying about issues of responsibility. Remember, as we described earlier, 
thoughts such as, "Everything has to proceed in the right way, or something bad might happen," "I must get everything finished on time," and "if 
I don't worry, then something really could go wrong," result from underlying 
beliefs that: (i) negative events are indeed very likely, (2) worrying prevents 
those events from happening, and (3) since you can predict what those events 
might be, it is your responsibility to be worried and to prevent their occurrence, because failure to do so means that you are neglecting your responsibilities. Through self-statement training, we aim to shift the perception that negative events are likely to occur at any moment, to help you to 
realize that worrying has no effect on the probability of independent events, 
and to help you to learn that letting go of worries does not mean that you 
are irresponsible, because what you are worried about is unlikely to occur 
in the first place. Responsibility is important only when the event that you 
are worried about is of high probability. Most of the events that concern 
people who worry chronically are of low probability. Another underlying 
belief has to do with a sense of incompetence, or the notion that, "If I make 
a mistake in my decisions or judgments, then I am incompetent." Sometimes this idea is related to a concern that other respected individuals will 
recognize our mistakes, whether that person is our boss, a parent, a friend, 
or a spouse. It is important to recognize that everyone makes mistakes, and 
in most cases, you are likely overestimating the significance of the mistake.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Decatastrophizing</p><p class="cl-cluster">Decatastrophizing involves imagining the worst possible outcome and then 
objectively judging its severity. Usually, you will realize that, although the 
event that you were worried about, if it were to come true, would be unpleasant, nonetheless, it would be manageable and time-limited. This means 
that you would be able to cope with the event and that the unpleasantness 
would not continue forever. Although some events may be very unpleasant, 
and you would not wish them on anyone (such as losing a loved one), the reality is that there is a way to survive these unpleasant events. It is important to recognize that there is a way to continue, even if the event brings 
about sadness and struggle. This is a more effective way of managing anxiety about such events than focusing on how horrible the event would be, 
without further consideration of ways to manage it. Recognizing your ability to cope with negative events involves recognizing alternative solutions 
to problems, as opposed to continuing to dwell on the catastrophic nature 
of negative outcomes. Thinking of a negative event as a disaster is very different from thinking of the same event with the realization that you can cope 
with it. We have to examine the evidence at hand to realize that we usually 
do cope, in one way or another, even when very negative events happen, 
such as wars, losing loved ones, or severe illnesses. In fact, great strength 
and mastery may come out of conditions of real sorrow or threat. This is 
not to say that all of the events that you worry about will occur. Decatastrophizing is just another strategy for learning to control the tendency to 
worry excessively about negative events. Decatastrophizing allows you to see 
that you can cope with negative outcomes that do occur.</p><div id="calibre_link-112" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Imagine yourself being reprimanded at work for having missed a very obvious mistake in a very important document that resulted in the firm losing a 
big project. Your boss is obviously disappointed in you. The question is how 
to manage the situation. The catastrophic approach would be to interpret 
this situation as a sign that you are incompetent in general, irresponsible in 
your decision-making, and out of control, and that this mistake represents 
the loss of all respect from others. The decatastrophizing approach would 
be to recognize that, while this is a very difficult situation that has had real 
consequences for your firm, everyone makes mistakes, and the severity of 
the situation will subside with time. In all likelihood, the people around you 
will continue to perceive you similarly to the way they perceived you before 
this event, and if even if they don't, that, too, will subside with time. To make 
a mistake is to be human, and to be judged negatively by others some of the 
time is part of everyone's existence.</p><p class="cl-cluster">In most cases, you can handle a worrisome thought by evaluating the evidence to consider the probabilities and by decatastrophizing. For example, 
let's say that you are worried about making mistakes at work and being 
fired as a result. You can challenge these thoughts by asking the following 
key questions: What is the likelihood that I will make a major mistake? What 
is the likelihood that my boss would fire me if I did make a mistake? And 
if I did get fired, what steps would I take to cope with the situation? For example, would you look for another job, seek assistance from friends or 
family, or take a break from work?</p><div id="calibre_link-113" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Review the episodes of anxiety that you recorded over the past couple of weeks, 
and evaluate whether any of your thoughts are examples of catastrophizing, 
or blowing things out of proportion. In other words, have you had the feeling that an event, if it were to happen, would he unmanageable or terrible? 
</p><p class="cl-cluster">For each episode of anxiety, question the assumption that the negative 
event would he a catastrophe. In some ways, you are being asked to say to 
yourself, "So what if it happens? I can deal with it." Of course, as discussed 
earlier, some situations are certainly negative, and it is not accurate to say, 
"It doesn't matter." However, it is important to realize that we all live through 
bad times, and even if negative events happen, life goes on and you can cope.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Putting Catastrophizing and Decatastrophizing Together</p><p class="cl-cluster">An example of catastrophizing and decatastrophizing with the help of a 
therapist follows:</p><p class="cl-cluster">Therapist: You said earlier that you sometimes worry again and again 
about the effect that your death would have on your family. 
Tell me more about this worry.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Sandra: Well, I worry because I don't want my kids to go through 
what I went through, and am still going through, when my 
father died last year. Besides the horrible sense of sadness 
they would suffer, who would look after them, and what 
would happen to them if I weren't around?</p><p class="cl-cluster">Therapist: What kind of situation do you imagine if you were to die? 
What would happen to your children?</p><p class="cl-cluster">Sandra: (Teary) It's really hard to talk about because I think it would 
be so terrible. I see them being alone, and crying, and not 
knowing what to do.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Therapist: These kinds of thoughts are obviously very distressing for 
you. Let's evaluate them. First of all, let's consider the possibility of overestimating the risk. Do you have any reason to 
believe that you'll die unexpectedly or soon?</p><div id="calibre_link-114" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Sandra: Only that my father died suddenly.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Therapist: What was the reason?</p><p class="cl-cluster">Sandra: Apparently, he had a heart condition that we didn't know 
about.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Therapist: What evidence do you have to believe that you have the 
same condition?</p><p class="cl-cluster">Sandra: None, actually. I had a complete checkup a few months after 
he died because I was so worried, and I'm in fine shape.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Therapist: Given the available evidence about your own health and 
the population statistic for a woman of your age dying unexpectedly for no apparent reason, what is the real probability of that you will die soon? Use the o- to too-point scale.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Sandra: When I think of it that way, I suppose it's really lowmaybe io%.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Therapist: So, you're telling me that for every day you live over the 
next few years, you have a one in ten chance of dying on 
any given day?</p><p class="cl-cluster">Sandra: (Laugh) No, I guess it's lower than that, probably less than i%.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Therapist: Okay, now there are other areas where you seem to have 
made assumptions and overlooked the evidence. Can you 
think of any?</p><p class="cl-cluster">Sandra: You mean the way my children would feel? I really believe 
that they would feel terrible.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Therapist: No, I'm not questioning the sadness and loss, but I am questioning your assumption that their lives would continue in 
that way. Even though it's difficult to think about, imagine 
what would happen over time, after your death.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Sandra: I suppose that, eventually, things would get back to some 
kind of normalcy, although not the same as if I were there. 
Their father is a good dad. He could probably look after them.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Therapist: Again, I want to emphasize that we are not saying that you 
most likely will die in the near future, or that you should think 
about it with a carefree attitude. However, realizing that, as 
difficult as it would be for them to lose you, your children may be able to survive and continue without you. That's a 
very different way of looking at the situation. Do you agree?</p><div id="calibre_link-115" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Sandra: Yes, I understand. I think I tend to do that with a lot of 
things. I think of the worst and just focus on that, without 
considering the alternatives.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Notice how this example demonstrates that negative thoughts can become 
so powerful that reasonable alternatives aren't even considered. Sandra hadn't 
considered the possibility of her family coping without her; she had only 
considered how terrible it would be if she were to die. It is important that 
you give full consideration to alternative ways of coping with future negative events or problems, so that you can interrupt the tendency to worry 
chronically, without ever reaching a solution or recognizing an alternative. 
Take the earlier example of worrying about being fired. Even though the 
probability of being fired may be low, it is important to realize that losing 
one's job does not have to mean a catastrophe. Looking for another job 
may not be enjoyable, but it can be done. Another example is the feeling 
of being overwhelmed and not having enough time to get tasks done. A 
good way to interrupt this worrisome thought is to ask yourself, What's the 
worst that can happen? For example, "What's the worst that can happen if 
I don't get everything done by the end of the day, or if somebody has to 
wait until tomorrow? So what if I leave the office without tidying my desk, 
or leave the house without making sure that it's in perfect order! What's the 
worst that can happen if I take thirty minutes to relax?" Your response 
might be, "If I don't get everything done today, it will pile up tomorrow 
and continue to pile up forever." In reality, there will always be things to 
be done, and one can never really reach the point of having everything 
completed. A more effective strategy is to accept the fact that there will always be things to do and to realize they don't all have to get done immediately. In chapter to, we describe ways to manage work overload.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Decatastrophizing Personal Examples</p><p class="cl-cluster">Go back to each example of catastrophic thinking that you recorded over the 
past couple of weeks. As objectively as you can, consider the meaning that 
you gave the event to see where you might be blowing things out of proportion, and where alternatives can be generated. Keep in mind that the goal of decatastrophizing is not positive thinking, but a realistic appraisal of possible outcomes.</p><div id="calibre_link-116" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Just as you used a pie chart to generate alternative interpretations for errors of 
overestimation, you can use a pie chart to generate alternative meanings of negative events. The following example shows alternative meanings of being fired.</p><p class="cl-cluster">It is important to remember that, decatastrophizing means placing events 
in perspective, and that means accepting the idea that we cannot prevent 
all negative events from happening, no matter how much we try. In addition, making mistakes is a normal part of human existence. The error is in 
blowing errors out of proportion by: (i) viewing mistakes as more significant than they really are, such as viewing our mistakes as a sign of a fatal 
character flaw or a sign of overall incompetence; and (2) failing to consider 
realistic ways of coping, should negative events occur.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Next, switch gears from focusing on "how bad it would be if it happened" 
to considering "ways of dealing with it." No matter how intense your fear, you will survive. No matter how distressing the moment, it will pass. So, 
the final step in decatastrophizing is to generate ways of coping with the 
event, if it were to happen. Think through what you would do if, for example, you received a negative review at work, lost your job, found out that 
you made the wrong choice when purchasing a car or house, or lost a child. 
Remember, you may become more anxious initially, as you face the situation and consider ways of coping, especially if you believe that the negative 
events are your responsibility. In these situations, the goal is to recognize that: 
(t) the event is unlikely to occur, (2) you are unlikely to be fully responsible 
for all negative events, (3) negative events happen to everyone, and (4) there 
are ways of coping with any event.</p><div id="calibre_link-117" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

<p class="cl-cluster">Decatastrophizing Pie Chart</p><div class="graphic"><img src="images/000035.jpg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><p class="cl-cluster">In fact, it is likely that, in the past, the intense anxiety associated with these 
thoughts led you to think desperately about something else, without fully 
addressing your main fear. For example, the anxiety associated with thinking about losing a loved one may lead you to divert your attention to other 
worries about less important things. Here, we are asking you to face di rectly the events that you are most afraid of, and by facing them directly, 
to realize that, as negative as they may be, there is a way to manage them. 
As we discuss in more detail in the next chapter, you will find that thoughts 
become less anxiety-provoking the more often you face them directly and 
consider ways to cope.</p><div id="calibre_link-119" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

and were you able to question the evidence and evaluate your ability to cope 
with negative events? If you have not done so, spend the next week closely 
monitoring and challenging your thoughts. As mentioned earlier, this program proceeds in a sequence, so that each new step depends on the steps 
learned earlier. It is essential that you have a good grasp of overestimating 
the risk and catastrophizing (thinking the worst) in relation to your own 
thinking. Actively challenging your thoughts takes some effort and may feel 
artificial initially, but practice helps to develop a stronger, realistic thinking style. As we described before, one of the reasons why anxious worries 
come to mind so often is because they have become habitual, or automatic, 
through repetition. For the alternative, realistic styles of thinking, to become habitual, you must practice and rehearse them, just as you would if 
you were studying a new language. With repetition, the new alternatives will become the more natural approach, and then you will no longer need 
to work at changing your anxious thoughts. It will happen naturally.</p><div id="calibre_link-122" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Relaxation</p><p class="cl-cluster">If you are successful with the four-muscle-group recall relaxation procedure (that is, you can achieve at least a moderate level of relaxation through 
concentration and regular breathing for approximately five minutes), it is 
time to move on to one-step relaxation. It's okay if you need more practice 
with the four-muscle-group recall-relaxation procedure; just delay the new 
one-step procedure until next week.</p><p class="cl-cluster">The one-step procedure is called "cue-controlled relaxation," and it is based 
on all of the relaxation practice you have done up until now, specifically, 
all of the times that you have paired the word "relax" with a feeling of relaxation. Now, we will use the word "relax" to bring on the feelings of relaxation. With the one-step procedure, you take a few slow breaths, and when 
breathing out, you repeat the word "relax" to yourself, while letting your 
whole body relax. Do not take unusually deep breaths; take slow, smooth 
breaths. As you exhale, let go of all of the tension in your body and relax 
into a drooping position. Practice taking four or five breathes and repeating the word "relax" on each exhalation, as you release the tension from 
your body. Concentrate on the feelings of relaxation.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Cue-Controlled Relaxation Procedure</p><p class="cl-cluster">i.When you notice tension, focus on your body and take four to five 
slow, smooth breaths.</p><p class="cl-cluster">2.On each exhalation, repeat the word "relax" to yourself.</p><p class="cl-cluster">3.Release the tension in your body with each exhalation.</p><p class="cl-cluster">4.Concentrate on the feelings of relaxation.</p><p class="cl-cluster">5.Maintain a pattern of slow, regular breathing.</p><p class="cl-cluster">6.Practice this one-step procedure in a variety of situations, such as at

different situations as possible.</p><div id="calibre_link-123" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">For the rest of the week, practice the cue-controlled procedure several times 
a day in various locations, not just in quiet, peaceful locations. The training phase is almost over, and as a last step, it is important to extend your 
practice to situations that are not truly conducive to relaxation. This will 
be a test of your ability to concentrate as well, since relaxing in the presence of other noises and people means cutting yourself off from the things 
around you, just to concentrate on relaxing. Practice cue-controlled relaxation at home, while waiting at traffic lights, at your desk, or in a movie 
theater. Practice as much as you can. You need a week of solid practice in 
as many situations as you can. From now on, it is no longer necessary to 
monitor your relaxation using the Relaxation Record.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Facing Your Fears: Taking the Bite out of Worry</p><p class="cl-cluster">Up until now, the goal has been to learn ways to control worrisome thoughts 
when they arise. Now the goal is to deliberately face the negative images 
that underlie the worry and learn to be less affected by them. As we described in chapter 2, there is evidence to show that much worrisome thinking is driven by images or pictures in one's mind of catastrophic events, as 
if they were actually happening. For example, if your worries are about 
your children's safety, then it is possible that these worries are connected to 
a picture or an image of your children being injured and you being blamed 
for being an irresponsible parent. The picture represents a visualization of 
the scene as if it were actually happening. Since this picture or image typically creates a high level of emotional distress and fear, it is not uncommon 
for people to divert their attention to worrying about checking on their 
children's safety, calling the school to make sure that the children are okay, 
and so forth. Such worry tends to be associated with less intense emotional 
distress than picturing catastrophic images, and therefore, becomes a preferred mode of operating. However, by avoiding the images through worrying, the images are likely to occur again. Now, it is time to face the fear 
and learn not to be afraid so that you don't have to worry so much. We 
know that fear will decrease through exposure, and so our goal in this chapter is to practice repeated exposure to the most feared images, while you are 
encouraged to think about what would happen as the feared image unfolds, 
and to do so repeatedly until the fear decreases.</p><div id="calibre_link-124" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">You will need to identify the most frightening, catastrophic image at the 
end of your chain of worries by asking yourself, "What is the worst-case 
scenario?" This is an extension of the work you did in the last chapter on 
identifying catastrophic thinking, but now you are going to focus on images, or pictures in your mind, rather than verbal statements of things that 
you worry about. The most frightening images are those brief pictures that 
pop into your mind that involve extreme catastrophe, such as a family member dying, being homeless and living on the streets, or being humiliated in 
front of your entire firm. You will identify the catastrophic image associated with each of your main topics of worry-your family, job security, 
health, and so on. For each worry, generate a description of the image that 
is tied to the worry in as much detail as possible, as if it were actually happening. Describe the situation that you imagine; your physical responses of 
fear, such as feeling sick to your stomach, a racing heart, or shortness of 
breath; and the meaning that you give to the situation, such as, "I am a 
sham and a failure." An example of an image in descriptive form would be, 
"Upon my yearly evaluation, my boss told me that my work was not up to 
par, and that I am too slow and make too many mistakes. I was fired and 
can no longer afford my apartment. I cannot find anywhere else to live. I 
am living on the streets. I feel weak, fragile, and disoriented. I believe that 
this has happened because I screwed up and that I am incompetent." Use 
the following Imagery Description form to help generate images for each 
main topic of your worry. Again, for each image, describe the situation, your 
physical responses, and the meaning you give to the situation. Spaces for 
three different images are provided, but you may add more, if necessary.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Now that you have generated several images, rate each one from o to too 
in terms of the level of distress that each one evokes as you think about 
what you have written. By facing these images repeatedly, you will learn 
something new. Specifically, you will learn that the emotional distress will 
decrease with repeated exposure, and that the image is just that, an image. 
In other words, repeated exposure to the image will enable you to change 
the meaning that you give to the image. For example, an image of a car accident is distressing only if you believe that the image means that the car 
accident is actually going to happen or that it is a result of your own incompetence. By imagining the scene repeatedly, you will learn that the image 
does not represent reality. In addition, facing your feared images and asking yourself how events will unfold after the worst-case scenario happens will enable you to think about realistic odds and ways of coping, using the 
tools you have already mastered. For example, if your feared image is of 
losing your job, the imagery exposure encourages you not only to imagine 
this event, but also to imagine what would happen after the event. For example, you will be encouraged to imagine what will happen one week, six 
months, and one year later.</p><div id="calibre_link-125" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

<p class="cl-cluster">Imagery Training</p><p class="cl-cluster">For imagery exposure, it is essential that you imagine the worse event happening and concentrate on it as hard as you can. Do not avoid the image, since 
avoiding it will defeat the purpose of the exercise. The skill of imagining 
can be practiced by first using pleasant scenes that do not involve anxiety. 
Imagine as best you can by putting yourself in a situation, not as if you are 
watching it like a movie, but as if you are really there. In other words, see 
the things and people around you, hear the sounds, and experience the situation physically and emotionally. Practice the technique by imagining the 
pleasant scenarios listed below. To do this, you may record each of the scenes 
on an audiotape, and then close your eyes while you play the tape and 
imagine the scene as vividly as you can. Repeat this procedure two or three 
times, remembering to focus on the physical experiences as you imagine.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Imagery Scene 1</p><p class="cl-cluster">You are sitting by a window. The window is square, with one clear pane of 
glass. There are yellow and white checkered curtains on the side. You are 
sitting on a soft chair, and you feel comfortable and relaxed. Your elbows 
are on the windowsill, and your hands are clasped under your chin. The 
sun is streaming in through the window, onto your face and hands. You feel 
warm, and the light is bright. You close your eyes and feel the warm sun.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Imagery Scene 2</p><p class="cl-cluster">You walk into a square room. The walls and ceiling are all a deep blue. On 
the floor is a blue carpet. The carpet is soft under your bare feet. There is 
nothing in the room, except for a plain wooden table in the middle. On the table, you see a clear glass pitcher filled with water and a tall, clear glass 
filled with ice. You are thirsty, and you are glad to see the water. Your mouth 
is very dry. You walk over to the table and pick up the pitcher in one hand 
and the glass in the other. You fill the glass with water. The hand that holds 
the glass feels cool as you fill the glass with water. You put the pitcher back 
on the table, and take a sip from the glass, letting the cold water flow slowly 
down your throat. You continue to drink the cold water and feel the sensation of water quenching your thirst.</p><div id="calibre_link-127" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Imagery Scene 3</p><p class="cl-cluster">It is summer. You are walking up a hill. You are on a dirt path lined with 
lilies. The lilies are bright yellow. You can smell them in the wind. The day 
is hot, and your feet feel tired. The ground is soft and not easy to walk on. 
You begin to sweat a little bit, and you rub your forehead with the back of 
your hand. The back of your hand feels wet. You get close to the top of the 
hill, and you begin to hurry. You can feel your heart pound as you reach 
the top. At the top is a soft patch of grass, in the shade, under a tree. You 
sit down on the grass and rest. You look at the path with the yellow lilies.</p><p class="cl-cluster">As you can see, each of these images is filled with sensations. As you imagine your own fearful images, incorporate fear responses (i.e., fear sensations), 
along with a description of the situation and the meaning that you give the 
situation. Once you have practiced imagery scenes several times, you will 
he ready to begin the actual exposure.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Procedures for Imagery Exposure</p><p class="cl-cluster">A specific set of procedures is to be used for the imagery exposure. Remember, follow these procedures after you have practiced with the pleasant imagery scenes.</p><p class="cl-cluster">I.Begin with the image associated with the least distress. Read your description, and then sit back, close your eyes, and imagine the scene as 
if it were actually happening. For example, the image might be of 
your spouse lying unconscious, and slumped over the steering wheel 
of a car. You are in the image as well. You feel weak and sick to your 
stomach, and you are about to faint. The meaning that you give to thisimagined scenario is that you are to blame, and that you should 
have known better than to let him or her drive home late after work. 
Again, imagine the scene as if it is actually happening, and include the 
situation, your fear response sensations, and the meaning you give to 
the situation in the imagery.</p><div id="calibre_link-128" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">2.After about 30 seconds, rate the vividness, or clarity, of the image 
and the maximum level of anxiety that you experience, using a o- to 
too-point scale, where o equals no image and no anxiety and too 
equals an extremely vivid image and extreme anxiety. An example of 
these ratings is on the Exposure Record.</p><p class="cl-cluster">3.If the image is not clear or is rated less than 50 on the o- to toopoint scale of vividness, spend another minute or so imagining the 
event. Remember to imagine yourself in the setting, not as an observer, but as a participant, and focus on the different fear response 
sensations and emotions that you imagine experiencing. If the image 
remains vague, practice several more times with the pleasant scenes 
described earlier. It is possible that your imagery is not clear because 
the particular image that you chose was not very frightening. If this 
is the case, choose the next most distressing image on your list. It is 
also possible that the image is not clear because it is too frightening 
and your mind is preventing you from letting yourself really experience what it is you fear. If this is the case, then continue with the exposure to this image, with the reassurance that the image, is just an 
image, and that by focusing on it, you are not causing the frightening scene to come true.</p><p class="cl-cluster">4.Once you have achieved a vivid image that is emotionally evocative, 
meaning that it produces some anxiety, the goal is to observe the 
image mindfully for five minutes. This may require repeated reading 
of the description of the image on your Imagery Description Form. 
After you read the description, close your eyes and imagine the event, 
as if it were actually happening. You might set a timer to let you 
know when the five-minute period is up. As you imagine the event, 
let yourself experience whatever emotions are actually produced by 
the image. Do not attempt to change either the image or your emotional experience. At this stage, the most important thing is to let 
yourself face the image and the associated emotions. As a result of 
repeated exposure to the image, the distress that it evokes and the meaningthat you ascribe to it will change. If your mind wanders 
during the five-minute interval, simply redirect your attention to the 
imagined situation, the imagined emotional and physical response, 
and the imagined meaning that you give to the situation, and again, 
let yourself observe the image and experience whatever emotions are 
produced by the image.</p><div id="calibre_link-129" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">5.After you complete five minutes of imagery, shift your attention to 
cue-controlled relaxation by taking several slow abdominal breaths, 
repeating the word "relax" to yourself on each exhalation, and letting 
your body relax into a drooped position. Then, ask yourself the following questions about the image: Because I imagined this event, will 
it come true? If this imagined event were to occur, what would I do 
to cope? Where am I overmagnifying the meaning of this imagined 
event? What is the realistic likelihood of this imagined event occurring? By asking these questions, your goal is to develop more realistic 
interpretations and coping solutions for the imagined event, recognizing all the while that it is just an image.</p><p class="cl-cluster">6.Once you have completed the relaxation procedure and answered the 
questions, repeat the entire imagining exercise. Read the description, 
and then imagine the event, as if it were actually happening, for about 
30 seconds. Rate the vividness of the image and the level of anxiety 
associated with the image. When you have a vivid image that is associated with at least some anxiety, continue imagining for five minutes, 
but this time, imagine not only the event, but also what would happen the next day, the next week, or the next month. In other words, 
imagine yourself actually coping with the imagined event. For example, see yourself one week after having lost your job, and then one 
month later. Then, practice cue-controlled relaxation and questioning of your self-statements, using the questions listed earlier. You 
might find that, as your emotional distress in response to the image 
decreases, your ability to imagine also decreases. This is to be expected, since the vividness of the imagery is partly due to its emotional intensity. The more you practice exposure to the image, the 
less frightening it will become, and hence, the less vivid it will be.</p><p class="cl-cluster">7.Continue for the number of repetitions necessary for your level of 
anxiety to decrease to 25 or less on the o- to ioo-point scale. Then, 
move to the next distressing image on your list, and begin the procedure again.</p><div id="calibre_link-130" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Exposure Record Example</p><p class="cl-cluster"><img src="images/000124.svg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p><p class="cl-cluster">We recommend that you practice the imagery exposure each day (3 times, 
5 minutes each) for the next week or two. Do not go on to the next chapter until you have completed one or two weeks of imagery exposure.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Potential Difficulties with Imagery Exposure</p><p class="cl-cluster">The following is a list of potential difficulties that you might encounter with 
imagery exposure, some of which we described in the previous section.</p><p class="cl-cluster">i.Sometimes it is difficult to fully and vividly imagine the worst-case 
scenario because you fear the image, because you are unskilled in 
imagining, or because you have chosen an image that is not sufficiently anxiety-producing. If you are afraid to imagine a particular 
scenario, remember not to confuse images with facts. Deliberately 
inducing a fearful image does not mean that the imagined event will 
come true. Also, remember that, with repetition, the distress that you 
feel will decrease. If you are having trouble imagining in general, 
practice with the pleasant scenes, focusing on the different sensations 
associated with each scene. If the image does not develop because it 
does not produce enough distress, then find another image that elicits more anxiety or distress.</p><p class="cl-cluster">2.Sometimes the procedure is not effective because the image is too 
general. Be as specific as you can in the images that come to mind. Forexample, if the image is the "future," you can make it more specific by imagining that five years from now you are unemployed, 
have no money, lose your house, and so on.</p><div id="calibre_link-131" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Exposure Record</p><p class="cl-cluster"><img src="images/000125.svg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p><div id="calibre_link-132" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">3.Sometimes images produce little or no anxiety. This can occur if the 
image is not vivid (vividness will come with practice and willingness 
to experience distress) or because the procedure has immediately 
helped you to view your concern more objectively. That is, by telling 
yourself to face the catastrophic images directly, you already may be 
recognizing that the image represents events that are unlikely to 
occur, or that could be managed if they did occur, or that the image 
is just an image. If so, then you have accomplished what you need to 
accomplish with the specific image, and you may move on to the 
next one. However, be absolutely sure that you are not just avoiding 
an image that distresses you.</p><p class="cl-cluster">4.Another potential difficulty is that you may experience little or no 
decrease in emotional distress with repetition of the imagery. This 
can happen if the image continuously changes. Remember to repeat 
the same image until your distress decreases, and then move on to 
the next image.</p><p class="cl-cluster">5.Finally, sometimes you will find that writing out or recording the 
images, as outlined earlier, is simply not enough to create emotional 
distress. Sometimes a real-life trigger is required, such as reading 
stories in newspapers and magazines about death, car accidents, 
robberies, and so on. Newspapers are full of this type of information, 
and for this reason, you may have learned to avoid them because they 
make you anxious. Now, it is time to overcome that fear. Look for 
newspaper stories that relate to your own catastrophic images, and 
use them to develop images of the catastrophic events you fear.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Homework</p><div class="graphic"><img src="images/000044.jpg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><div class="graphic"><img src="images/000045.jpg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><p class="cl-cluster">Practice cue-controlled relaxation whenever and wherever you can.</p><div class="graphic"><img src="images/000046.jpg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><p class="cl-cluster">Apply realistic thinking strategies by considering the real odds, alternative possibilities, and ways of coping for each worrisome thought.</p><div id="calibre_link-133" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

strategies (questioning the real odds, considering alternatives, and generating ways of coping). Add your summary data to your Progress Record. Examine the patterns that you have observed since the beginning of the program. It is possible that the imagery exposure practices over the last couple 
of weeks have increased your level of anxiety or the number of episodes of 
anxiety, because you have been focusing on the very things that frighten 
you most. However, this initial increase in anxiety will decrease. The more 
comfortable you become with the images, realizing that they are just images, the less anxiety you will experience.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Did you practice cue-controlled relaxation in as many different situations 
as possible? This particular relaxation exercise will not work if you have 
been getting upset about not relaxing right away. Nor will it work if you believe that you must relax completely or things will be a disaster. If you feel desperate every time you try to relax, it's almost guaranteed that you will 
not be able to relax. Remember, relaxation is a useful strategy for calming 
yourself, but it is not necessary for your survival. The next, and final step, 
in relaxation training is to use this tool throughout the day, as you feel tension or anxiety building. Up until now, you have been using these methods in either relaxing situations or distracting environments. The final phase 
is to apply cue-controlled relaxation whenever tension builds. As you feel 
your muscle tension increasing, whether you are at work, in the car, or trying to get the kids ready for bed, take a few slow, abdominal breaths, repeat 
to yourself the word "relax" on each exhalation, and physically let go of the 
tension in your body. This brief interruption of the cycle of anxiety and 
tension may be very effective in helping you to gain a different perspective 
on whatever it is you're dealing with at that moment. In fact, each time you 
notice anxiety and tension building, first, relax using the cue-controlled 
procedure; and then ask yourself these questions: What it is that I'm worried about? What are the real odds of that happening? What is the worst 
that can happen? How would I cope with that if it were to come true?</p><div id="calibre_link-134" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Imagery Exposure</p><p class="cl-cluster">Follow the procedure described in the last chapter for any remaining images on your list. As a reminder, the method is to imagine the worst-case 
scenario, as if it were actually happening, including a description of the situation, your physical responses to the situation, and the meaning that you 
give to the situation. After about 30 seconds, rate the vividness and anxiety 
associated with the image. If the image is sufficiently vivid, imagine the scene, 
as if it were actually happening, for approximately five minutes. If your 
mind wanders during that time, just return your attention to the situation, 
your responses, and the meaning you give the situation. If it is difficult to 
imagine a scene vividly, go back to your Imagery Description Form and remind yourself of the scene, and then close your eyes and imagine it, as if it 
were happening. After five minutes, practice cue-controlled relaxation and 
then think through the questions that were posed in the last chapter: Because I imagined this event, will it come true? If this imagined event were 
to occur, what would I do to cope? Where am I overmagnifying the meaning of this imagined event? What is the realistic likelihood of this imagined 
event coming true? Then, repeat the imagery exposure for two more fiveminute periods, each time imagining forward in time to visualize yourself 
coping beyond the point at which the imagined negative event occurred.</p><div id="calibre_link-135" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">The goals of this exposure are to reduce the level of emotional distress in 
response to the image and to learn to reevaluate the significance of the 
image by recognizing that it is just an image, and that the imagined event 
is unlikely to occur, and that, if it were to occur, it would be manageable 
in some way.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Worry Behavior</p><p class="cl-cluster">The next step toward controlling your worry and anxiety involves work in 
everyday situations. From chapter 3, you may recall that we described anxious behaviors as behaviors that are designed to: (t) prevent bad things 
from happening, (2) prevent yourself from worrying, and (3) provide reassurance. Although these behaviors may seem small and insignificant, they 
can play a very big role in perpetuating anxiety and worry. If you continually use these types of behaviors to "keep yourself and your family safe," to 
minimize the likelihood of worrying, or to obtain reassurance, then you 
never give yourself the chance to learn that whatever you are worried about 
either may not happen, or if it were to happen, could be managed. In other 
words, these anxious behaviors reinforce worry. An example of an anxious 
behavior designed to prevent bad things from happening might be staying 
late at work every night so as not to be reprimanded the next day for not 
having completed everything that was assigned. An anxious behavior designed to prevent worry may be avoiding taking on extra responsibilities 
for fear that the responsibilities would cause you to worry. An anxious behavior designed to provide reassurance might be checking on the safety of 
family members throughout the day.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Of course, some safety-checking and avoidance behaviors are very important and worthwhile. If you are living in a dangerous neighborhood, it makes 
sense to be more concerned and to check more carefully on the safety of 
your children, for example. If a gang of delinquents is terrorizing the 
neighborhood, for example, it would be worthwhile to prevent your children from walking outside without the protection of an adult. However, if 
your neighborhood is safe, then it is not necessary to protect your children 
as much. Similarly, if your husband or wife is in good physical health, then 
it is not necessary to check on him or her regularly during the day. And, it 
is probably not necessary to make the extra effort to keep your house perfectly clean so as to prevent being judged negatively by unexpected visitors.</p><div id="calibre_link-136" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">On the Anxious Behaviors form, make a list of all of the behaviors that you 
recognize as being excessive and based on worry. Use your Worry Records 
over the past few weeks to help you identify your most common anxious 
behaviors. Remember, anxious behaviors may take many forms, including 
checking or reassurance-seeking, saying "no" to additional demands or responsibilities for fear of becoming worried, overprotectiveness with regard 
to your family and making an extra effort at work for fear of being fired. 
An example of a completed form follows; notice that, for each anxious behavior, you will eventually list a nonanxious behavior, but leave that section of the form blank for now.</p><p class="cl-cluster">From this list of behaviors, you will develop a set of tasks that are designed 
to replace the anxious behaviors with nonanxious behaviors. As a specific 
example, if your anxious behavior is to always arrive early at appointments 
for fear of being late, then the task would be to arrive on time, instead of 
early. Similarly, if your anxious behavior is to check on your family members repeatedly throughout the day, then the task will involve limiting the 
number of checks to perhaps one time a day. If the behavior is never to 
allow your son to sleep at a friend's house because you worry about his safety, 
even though you know and trust the parents of your child's friend, then the 
practice would be to allow your son to sleep at his friend's house. If one of 
your anxious behaviors is to never leave the house before everything is clean and in place, then the practice will be to leave the house with at least one 
thing left undone. If the behavior is to call a radio station about road accidents to check that your husband is safe and has not been involved in an 
accident, then the practice will be to prevent yourself from calling the radio 
station. If the behavior is to stay at work late every night so that your desk 
is clean and all of the day's tasks are completed, then your practice will be 
to leave work without cleaning off your desk or completing every task. If 
your behavior is to avoid inviting friends to your house because you imagine that they will not have a good time, then the task will be to arrange a 
get-together at your house. If your behavior has been to avoid buying a 
new car, even though your current car is in terrible condition and you can 
afford a new car, then the behavioral task will involve taking steps toward 
purchasing a car and managing the anxiety that will result from decisionmaking regarding which car to buy. If your anxious behavior involves obtaining excessive amounts of information or opinions from various people 
about a purchase for fear of making the wrong choice, then the task will 
involve making the purchase based on fewer opinions and less information. 
Next to each anxious behavior that you have identified, list the appropriate nonanxious behaviors. Finally, rate each nonanxious behavior on a o- to 
too-point scale on how much anxiety you anticipate you will experience as 
you practice these nonanxious behaviors. As always, o means no anxiety, 50 
means a moderate amount of anxiety, and ioo means extreme anxiety.</p><div id="calibre_link-137" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Anxious Behaviors Example</p><p class="cl-cluster"><img src="images/000133.svg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p><div id="calibre_link-138" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

<p class="cl-cluster">Of course, your first reaction to these suggestions might be, "I couldn't do 
that. What if something terrible happens?" Feeling hesitant about these behavioral changes is exactly why it is important to implement them, because 
the hesitation means that you are continuing to overestimate the likelihood 
of negative events or continuing to view negative events as unmanageable. 
Evaluate the likelihood of whatever it is that you are concerned about happening, as well as your ability to deal with the negative event, if it were to 
happen before you implement the behavioral change. Once you have practiced the behavioral change a number of times, you will learn that whatever it was that you were concerned about either is unlikely or is manageable. The goals are to tolerate imperfection, to let go of attempts to control 
everything, to let go of the sense of responsibility for unlikely events, and 
to realize that making mistakes is part of being human. These practices will 
lead you on a sure path to achieving these goals.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Begin with the least anxiety-provoking behavioral change. Practice this behavioral change as many times as necessary for your anxiety level to de crease to least 25 on the o- to too-point scale, in the same way that you did 
as you faced your most catastrophic images. For example, it may take five 
days in a row for you to practice not calling the radio station to ask about 
road accidents before your anxiety about not calling decreases to a mild 
level. Of course, you should realize by now that your anxiety will decrease 
with repeated practice because you will learn that your concerns are unfounded; you will gather evidence that allows you to reevaluate the odds 
and decatastrophize your worries. In other words, by not calling the radio 
station repeatedly, you will learn that nothing has changed in term of real 
outcomes, based on whether you call the radio station or not.</p><div id="calibre_link-140" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">You can facilitate these tasks by using cue-controlled relaxation strategies 
and realistic thinking strategies. For example, if you become very anxious 
knowing that you left work with one incomplete task on your desk, practice cue-controlled relaxation and consider the real odds of your behavior 
leading to a serious outcome, and if there is any negative outcome (such as 
your boss asking why the project was not completed), consider ways in 
which you would manage it.</p><p class="cl-cluster">As with the imagery exposures, keep a record of your progress with each 
behavioral change on the Behavioral Change form, as shown in the following example. On the form, record the maximum level of anxiety that you 
felt during each practice. The form has enough spaces for one behavioral 
change per day for a week, but you may end up making more changes than 
one per day; the more, the better. Of course, depending on the task, you 
may have to wait until the end of the day to make your ratings; that would be the case, for example, if the task were to avoid calling your husband or 
wife at all when he or she is at work. A summary of the instructions for 
these behavioral changes is provided.</p><div id="calibre_link-141" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Behavioral Change Example</p><p class="cl-cluster"><img src="images/000135.svg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p><div id="calibre_link-142" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

<p class="cl-cluster">Instructions for Behavioral Change Exercises</p><p class="cl-cluster">For each behavioral change practice, use the following steps:</p><p class="cl-cluster">t.Consider the practical aspects of the behavioral change: what you 
must do or not do, and how you will do or not do it. This may entail 
some planning, such as asking a friend to watch your children, arranging a dinner party, and so on. In addition, inform your family 
and friends of any changes in behaviors that may affect them. For example, let your husband or wife know if you are not going to make 
your usual daily calls.</p><p class="cl-cluster">2.Consider the worrisome thoughts that will come to mind as a result 
of the behavioral change, and think about how you will deal with 
them. That is, have your realistic thinking strategies prepared to deal 
with the worry that occurs as you make these behavioral changes.</p><p class="cl-cluster">3.Practice each behavioral change as many times as necessary for your 
anxiety to decrease to a mild level, about 25 or less on the o- to toopoint scale. Depending on the task, you may be able to practice it 
repeatedly very quickly, such as one day after another. For example, 
limiting yourself to just one phone call to your children or other 
family members can be practiced every day. On the other hand, some 
tasks will have to be spread out over longer intervals; for example, arranging for visitors to come to your home or for babysitters to look 
after your children may be limited to once or twice a week. For this 
reason, you could tackle several behavioral changes at once, instead 
of waiting to finish one behavioral change before moving on to the 
next one. For example, you could leave your desk a mess at the end 
of the day and ask your supervisor questions that you have been 
avoiding at the same time. In general, though, it is better to proceed 
from less anxiety-producing changes to more anxiety-producing 
changes.</p><div id="calibre_link-144" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Potential Difficulties with Behavioral Change Exercises</p><p class="cl-cluster">The following difficulties can sometimes occur as you change your behaviors.</p><p class="cl-cluster">t.Procrastination. This means putting off the behavioral change with 
comments such as, "I'll do it next week." Examine the reasons for 
procrastinating. Maybe you feel that the change is too much work 
and that it is easier to stay with your old ways. It's true that these behavioral changes require effort and planning, and they will sometimes increase your anxiety. However, the long-term benefit will be 
worth it. Another reason for procrastination might be that you are 
afraid to make the behavioral change. In this case, redirect your attention to what you are worried about, how likely that event is, and 
how you would cope if it were to come true.</p><p class="cl-cluster">2.Immediate anxiety. Perhaps you practiced the behavioral change on 
one occasion and felt so anxious that you decided not to go through 
with it again. It is possible that you will experience high anxiety the 
first time you practice some of these behavioral changes because you 
may feel as if you are setting yourself up for negative outcomes. 
However, with repeated practice your level of anxiety will decrease. 
Remember, in the end, it is more effective to take risks than it is to 
live in a constant state of vigilance and preparation for negative 
events. Some risk-taking will teach you to be more relaxed and confident in your ability to manage negative events when they do occur.</p><p class="cl-cluster">3.Being unprepared. A related difficulty is feeling unprepared to deal 
with the anxiety that you will experience as a result of the behavioral 
changes. To be prepared for the anxiety, think of all of the possible 
worries that could enter your mind as you make these behavioral 
changes. Then, address each worry by considering the real odds, alternative possibilities, and ways of coping.</p><p class="cl-cluster">4.Impractical tasks. Sometimes the behavioral changes are simply too 
impractical. For example, taking a long trip that you have avoided 
for years may be very difficult to arrange, in addition to being hard 
to repeat. It is usually better to work with practical, daily activities, 
although if the opportunity for a big behavioral change arises, then 
definitely go for it.</p><div id="calibre_link-145" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">5.Little or no anxiety. This may occur because, by the time you reach 
this point in the program, you already fully understand that you are 
overestimating the likelihood of negative events or blowing things 
out of proportion. That is a sign of success. Anxiety also may be 
minimal if you are "sabotaging" the practice of behavioral change by 
continuing to engage in subtle safety checks or subtle behavioral 
avoidances. For example, if the behavioral change is to leave your 
desk untidy at the end of the day, you may sabotage the goal of learning that a messy desk will not lead to disaster by arriving at work 
early enough the next day so that you can tidy your desk before anyone else arrives. Watch out for these types of "sabotaging" behaviors.</p><p class="cl-cluster">6.No decrease in anxiety. If your anxiety level does not decrease with 
repeated practice of the behavioral change, it is possible that your 
thinking is continuing to support the idea of negative outcomes. For 
example, if visitors did not make negative comments about your 
home, even though it was not completely in order, you may believe 
that they simply did not want to tell you how bad it looked, or that 
they did not notice, but other visitors would have seen the mess, and 
so on. Of course, these types of interpretations are as negative and 
unrealistic as the reasons why you have not invited people in the first 
place. Watch out for these types of misinterpretations.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Homework</p><div class="graphic"><img src="images/000049.jpg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><div class="graphic"><img src="images/000050.jpg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><p class="cl-cluster">Over the next few weeks, tackle the behavioral changes that you have

your anxious behaviors. If you have not practiced these behavioral changes, 
we recommend that you spend the time it takes to progress through your 
list of anxious behaviors before going on.</p><p class="cl-cluster">If you have practiced these behavioral changes, congratulations! Now, ask 
yourself what you have learned from your behavioral changes. You have 
probably learned that your initial predictions were incorrect and that your 
safety-checking or avoidance behaviors were unnecessary. If you still hold 
on to thoughts, such as, "what if?" or "I was lucky. It could still happen," 
you will need to further examine the validity of your thoughts. Remember,

appropriate worries about real dangers.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Add your summary data to your Progress Record. Have your ratings declined

<p class="cl-cluster">Dealing with Problems</p><p class="cl-cluster">As a final step in this training program, we will discuss certain valuable skills 
that you can use when stressful issues arise. We have found that the most 
common sources of stress, by far, in our clients, are: (i) feeling overwhelmed 
by obligations and duties and (2) dealing with crises or problems that arise 
from time to time in everyone's life. For people who tend to be high-strung 
or anxious, these stressful situations compound their anxiety. For this 
reason, we devote this chapter to skills for dealing with these sources of 
stress. These skills can be divided into time management, goal-setting, and 
problem-solving through brainstorming.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Time Management</p><p class="cl-cluster">Sometimes people take on too many tasks at one time, often because they 
feel personally responsible for everything and want everything to be perfect. Of course, having too many tasks creates tension, pressure, and worry 
about not getting everything done. Ways to deal with this type of stress include: (i) using realistic thinking strategies to address your concerns about 
what could happen if you did not get everything completed on time and 
(2) letting go of some of the unnecessary tasks or limiting the number of 
tasks that you attempt to complete at one time.</p><p class="cl-cluster">To help you determine if you have too many things on your daily schedule right now, make three lists. First, list every activity that you did today, 
at work and at home. Use the Daily Activities form, as shown in the following example. Be as specific as possible. For example, include all of your 
routine activities and every task that you spent time on, no matter how big 
or small. Second, list the activities that you planned to do, but did not do 
today. Third, list the activities that you wanted to do, but had no time to 
even consider doing. If the second list is quite long (meaning that you have 
many things on your schedule that you did not have time to attend to), and 
if the third list is full of pleasurable activities (meaning that you are someone with too much work and not enough play in your schedule), then you 
are probably overcommitted. Look at the items on the first list. If some of the items are unnecessary, then it's likely that you are not managing your 
time very well. Eliminating the unnecessary activities will allow more time 
for you to complete what you need to do and will also give you some welldeserved time for pleasurable activities.</p><div id="calibre_link-148" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">There are four basic ways to help you manage your time more efficiently.</p><p class="cl-cluster">t.Delegating responsibility. It's possible that others in your family or at 
work could do many of the tasks that you currently perform. For example, instead of making a special trip to the store, you might ask 
your children or spouse to pick up something from the store on the 
way home. Similarly, instead of taking primary responsibility for preparing meals, you could ask your children to help. "Fat chance," you 
may say. A surprisingly large number of our clients don't even bother 
asking, for fear of conflict and rejection. When they do ask, however, 
they often get far more help than they anticipated. Remember, if you 
worry about whether others will do the work as well as you could 
(which may be one reason why you take on so much work in the first 
place), you are making predictions that should be subjected to the realistic thinking strategies that we discussed in previous chapters. For 
example, ask yourself what is the worst that can happen if a letter is 
not written in exactly the way you would have written it, or if dinner 
is not cooked as well as you would have cooked it. You can also ask 
yourself what is the worst that could happen if others find out that 
you are not taking on all of the responsibilities that you once did.</p><p class="cl-cluster">2.Saying "no." It is also possible that you don't complete planned activities because of unexpected demands that you feel obliged to handle. Forexample, you may have planned to spend several hours working in 
the garden (an enjoyable and productive activity for you), but your friend 
called to ask you to baby-sit for her while she goes shopping. Under 
these circumstances, it is reasonable to say no and not to worry about 
hurting your friend's feelings. Why? There are two reasons: (i) your 
friend asked you at the last minute, and (2) it is not a life-or-death 
situation. Difficulty saying no is often based on worries about being 
rejected or angering others. Usually, these worries are not based in fact. 
Saying no and delegating responsibility are very good candidates for 
the behavioral change exercises that we outlined in the previous chapter. 
You will most likely find that others will not be hurt if you say no 
(unless, of course, you say it in a very inappropriate or aggressive manner). Occasionally saying no in an appropriate way can actually contribute to the development of mutual respect between two people.</p><div id="calibre_link-149" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Daily Activities Example</p><p class="cl-cluster"><img src="images/000144.svg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p><div id="calibre_link-150" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

<p class="cl-cluster">3.Sticking to an agenda. Frequently, we can become overwhelmed by 
many other tasks that present themselves when we begin one particular assignment. For example, if your task is to organize your files, you 
might decide to reorganize your entire office. Usually, it is more efficient to stick with the task that you started.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Avoidingperfectionism. Finally, it is possible that tasks take too long 
or become overwhelming because of your own perfectionism. In this 
case, it is important to recognize that raising the bar too high only 
makes your life more difficult. We often use the 85% rule. If you 
typically spend to hours preparing a document for your office files, 
this time, spend only 8.5 hours. You must recognize that the document may not be as good as you would have liked, but the importance of the document does not warrant to hours of your time. This

important things to do, with no chance of completing all of them. At this 
point, you can just give up and doom yourself to a life of stress and anxiety, or you can set some firm priorities. Setting priorities and realizing that 
some things just cannot be done is an important skill. Priorities can be set 
on a daily basis or over the long term. For a given day, make a list of all of the 
things that you plan to do. Then, decide how important it is to complete 
each task. To do this, rate each task as A, B, or C. A tasks are top-priority 
tasks. These are the tasks that absolutely must get done that day. Some days, 
you may have no A tasks. B tasks are important, but do not absolutely have 
to get done that day. These are the most common tasks. If they are not 
completed, they will eventually become A tasks. C tasks need to get done 
some day, but they aren't really important today.</p><p class="cl-cluster">To organize your day, you can use the following steps. First, record the activities that have to be done at specific times, such as attending meetings, 
picking up your children, and so on. Then, begin with the A tasks, and 
schedule them for the times during which you think they can be accomplished. Be somewhat flexible in case you have unexpected interruptions. 
For example, do not schedule one A task immediately after another A task 
because you may be interrupted or delayed. You can sacrifice a B or C task 
so that you can complete an A task, but you cannot sacrifice another A 
task. Remember to allow much more time to complete the task than you 
initially predict. Build in time for unexpected events. Next, place the B tasks into some time slots, again giving yourself enough leeway to get them 
done or partially done. Finally, fill in any remaining time slots with C tasks.</p><div id="calibre_link-153" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

with time management, prioritizing tasks, and feeling overwhelmed with 
real-life problems that occasionally arose. As shown on Nancy's Daily Activities form, which follows, Nancy has a packed day and works long hours 
as an executive accountant and she also has children. However, some of the 
activities that she reported on the form were unnecessary. For example, 
Nancy could have asked her children to clean the cat litter and asked her 
husband to prepare breakfast (or at least help). That way, she could have 
done some of the activities in the third column, such as finishing the letter 
to her sister.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Also, notice how Nancy spent time working on reports and audits as a favor 
to her co-workers. In the second column, she listed finishing the inventory as something she had wanted to do, but did not do. Clearly, Nancy could 
have said "no" when asked to do the co-worker's report in order to give herself more time to finish the inventory. Notice that Nancy also spent time 
on the phone with an angry client. On further questioning, Nancy informed 
us that this is something that someone else in the office usually handles, but 
that person was away from his desk. Instead of handling the call herself, 
Nancy could have not picked up the phone. That would have freed up another hour for her to do other things. Nancy also entertained a job candidate at a restaurant. Once again, Nancy admitted to us that she was asked 
to do this at the last minute by her supervisor. Normally, Nancy uses this 
time to go to her aerobics class. Again, Nancy could have delegated the responsibility of the dinner interview to another person. Finally, when Nancy 
arrived home from work, instead of preparing her kids' lunches for the next 
day, she could have asked her husband or children to help. We often see 
this pattern, in which our client takes care of all of the family's needs at the 
expense of his or her own. This behavior usually stems from wanting things 
to be perfect and feeling anxious when they are not. Nancy stated to us that her children "are not good at that kind of thing," and said that she has 
never given them the opportunity to take care of their own lunch preparation. By delegating this job to them, she would not only be giving herself 
time to relax after work, but also would be teaching her children a valuable 
skill that they will eventually use. A related issue is Nancy's reluctance to 
have her husband do his own laundry. She could briefly explain the procedure for washing clothes to him, and then allow him to take care of this 
task. In this way, she could do her own laundry, read, play with her kitten, 
and so on-all of the things that she wanted to do, but didn't because she 
had no time left for herself.</p><div id="calibre_link-154" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

<p class="cl-cluster">Because her schedule tends to be quite hectic, Nancy decided that the best 
strategy for reaching her goals would be to make a list of A, B, and C activities for the day. She crossed off each task that she managed to finish that 
day. Nancy reported that the ABC method of arranging her daily activities 
helped her to get a sense of what had to get done and what could wait until 
later. She managed to complete all of her A tasks and also several of her B 
and C tasks.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Problem-Solving through Brainstorming</p><p class="cl-cluster">Brainstorming is a useful technique for times when real problems or crises 
arise. Donald Meichenbaum, a Canadian psychologist, has developed a specific set of procedures for helping people solve real problems. Dr. Meichenbaum has found that people tend to have two types of difficulties when 
problem-solving. First is the tendency to think of the problem in broad, 
vague, and catastrophic ways. This means becoming overwhelmed and losing sight of the specifics. It is more helpful to think through the specific 
and objective details of the problem, as opposed to focusing on your thoughts 
or feelings about the situation. For example, if the problem has to do with 
your child's rebellious behavior, describing the problem as "Kathy is being 
very rude" is too vague, while describing the problem as "Kathy doesn't 
care about my feelings and doesn't appreciate everything that I have done 
for her over the years" is too emotional. Describing it as "Kathy doesn't do 
her chores around the house and doesn't tell me what time she will be 
home" is better, because it is more descriptive and detailed. Part of the skill 
in problem description is identifying the real problem. For example, if your 
child is not doing well in school, different solutions would be appropriate, depending on the source of your child's difficulties, such as the teachers, 
her friends, or her home life.</p><div id="calibre_link-156" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">The second difficulty that many people have when trying to solve problems 
is feeling that there is no possible solution. This is where brainstorming is 
used. Brainstorming means letting your mind go and coming up with 
every possible solution, no matter how unreasonable or silly it may sound. 
The idea is that, by doing this, you will be more likely to realize that there 
are potentially good solutions that you had not considered. After you come 
up with a number of possible solutions, select the solutions that are practical, and then decide which is the best. It is helpful to list the solutions in 
order of best to worst. Generate several possible solutions so that you have 
a backup plan if the first one doesn't work. Finally, it's important to decide 
on a plan of action for carrying out the solution. Following is an outline 
for brainstorming.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Outline for Brainstorming</p><p class="cl-cluster">When you are faced with a real-life problem or crisis, use the following 
steps:</p><p class="cl-cluster">i.Write down specifically what the problem is. Avoid being vague, too 
general, or overly emotional when describing the problem.</p><p class="cl-cluster">z..Let your mind go, and write down every possible solution that comes 
to you, no matter how foolish, silly, or ridiculous it sounds.</p><p class="cl-cluster">3.Rank these solutions in order, from best to worst, based on how 
practical and reasonable they are.</p><p class="cl-cluster">4.Decide on a specific plan of action in order to carry out each reasonable solution. Rate the probability of each solution working.</p><p class="cl-cluster">5.Put the plan for the most reasonable solution into action. If it doesn't 
help to solve the problem, move down your list to the next best solution, and then try again until you can successfully resolve the problem.</p><p class="cl-cluster">While in treatment at our clinic, Michael, one of our clients, complained 
of having a real-life problem for which he could find no acceptable solution. 
His problem was car trouble. Michael found himself spending hundreds of 
dollars on his car's transmission and various engine parts. We suggested that he try brainstorming to find a solution. The results of his brainstorming 
session are shown in the table. Clearly, the best thing that Michael could 
do at this point was get a second opinion about his car from a different mechanic. Perhaps all his car needed was better service and maintenance. 
"Going to a different mechanic" would be the best solution to try first.</p><div id="calibre_link-157" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Brainstorming Example: Spending Too Much Money on an Old Car</p><p class="cl-cluster"><img src="images/000147.svg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p><p class="cl-cluster">Michael listed his second best solution as borrowing his brother's car after 
trading in his own car and saving up for a new car. Michael planned to use 
this solution if another mechanic also said that his car needed serious work. 
Using what is called a cost-benefit analysis, or a closer look at the expenses 
associated with both short-term and long-term solutions, Michael realized 
that the money he was spending on repairs totaled more than the cost of 
buying a new, reliable car, with few maintenance problems. It would be 
practical to trade in or sell his current car and borrow his brother's extra car 
while Michael saved for a new one. As we see from Michael's ratings, he 
used this cost-benefit analysis to judge how reasonable and practical each 
solution would be. The seventh best solution in which he would deliberately burn or total the car and collect the insurance money, is, for obvious 
reasons, the least desirable possibility and a rather extreme and criminal 
way to solve this problem! Brainstorming, then, can help you gain a sense 
of perspective on your real-life problems and pave the way for solving them.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Now, let's examine Michael's probability rating. Although he rated "trade 
it in and buy a new car" as having too% probability of working, his first 
choice, "go to a different mechanic," was the least expensive and most bene ficial strategy to try at this point, even though it may not be as effective as 
buying a new car. Since Michael, like most people, must live on a budget, 
he used the cost-benefit analysis to find the best solution with a high probability of working.</p><div id="calibre_link-158" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

treat anxiety</p><p class="cl-cluster">■To talk to your physician about stopping your medication, if you are 
currently taking any</p><p class="cl-cluster">Reasons for Taking Drugs for Anxiety</p><p class="cl-cluster">If you're like many people with anxiety, you have probably already been to 
see your family doctor, who has prescribed a mild tranquilizer for your anxiety. You may be taking this medication regularly, or perhaps only occasionally, when you feel particularly nervous or anxious. Many people go through 
this program without ever taking medication; others would just as soon not 
take the medication, but are doing so on the advice of their physician. 
However, there are a number of people who take medication for their anxiety, for a variety of reasons. For some, the anxiety is so overwhelmingly 
severe that they feel that they cannot take even one more day of being anxious, and they want relief as soon as possible. Even the drug that takes the 
longest time to start to be effective would take only three weeks. Some of 
the shorter-acting drugs can be effective within a day or two. These drugs 
are likely to have some beneficial effect in a shorter period than this program, unless you are able to set aside time to work through the chapters 
fairly quickly. Others may not feel that they have the time to devote to this 
program right now, and believe that medication is the next best option. 
Still others may believe strongly that medication is the most appropriate 
treatment for their anxiety.</p><p class="cl-cluster">In any case, almost 6o% of the people who come to one of our clinics for 
treatment are taking some kind of medication for their anxiety. Naturally, all of the people coming to our clinics who are taking medication are still suffering from anxiety, or they wouldn't bother to come. For others, their family physician has given them a prescription to get through the next couple of 
weeks, but has also told them to come to our clinics as soon as possible.</p><div id="calibre_link-159" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">As we mentioned in the introduction, it is not at all necessary that you stop 
taking your medication before starting the program. However, approximately half of the people completing this program stop taking drugs on 
their own (usually with the help of their physician) by the time they finish 
this program, and most others stop sometime during the first year after they 
finish the program. Below, we describe methods for using this program to 
help you stop taking drugs, if you want to.</p><p class="cl-cluster">At this point, the evidence seems quite clear that several types of drugs, if 
prescribed at the appropriate dosage, may be effective for at least shortterm relief of anxiety for some people. Many of these drugs, however, are 
not effective in the long term unless you continue to take them indefinitely. 
Even then, they may lose some of their effectiveness, unless you learn some 
new, more adaptive methods of coping with your anxiety while you are 
taking the drug.</p><p class="cl-cluster">There are also some individuals who begin drug therapy and stop several 
months later, without any need to go through a program such as this. Whether 
the particular stress that they were under has resolved itself, whether there were 
some neurobiological changes in their "emotional sensitivity," or whether 
they developed a different attitude toward their anxiety, that was the only 
treatment that they needed. For all of these reasons, it seems useful to review briefly the types of medications prescribed for anxiety, as well as the 
best times to use them, based on current knowledge.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Anti-Anxiety Drugs</p><p class="cl-cluster">Benzodiazepines, or high-potency benzodiazepines, better known as minor 
tranquilizers, are commonly prescribed for anxiety. The types and brand 
names of minor tranquilizers are far too numerous to mention here, but four 
of the most common are diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam 
(Ativan), and clonazepam (Klonopin). There is another type of anti-anxiety 
drug that is not a benzodiazepine. This drug is called buspirone (BuSpar). 
The U.S.Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved all of these 
drugs, except klonopin, for the treatment of GAD.</p><div id="calibre_link-160" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Typically, these drugs are prescribed for short-term relief of anxiety. Evidence indicates that these drugs can be effective in relieving anxiety for a 
short period, although there is little or no evidence that they work over a 
long period. One of the reasons for this is that after several weeks, a tolerance to some of these drugs begins to develop. That is, you would require 
a higher dosage of the drug to obtain the same anxiety-reducing effect. 
Also, unless you work carefully with your doctor, there is a danger that you 
could become psychologically and physically dependent on benzodiazepines. 
If dependence does develop, it can be very hard to stop taking the drug because you will experience some withdrawal effects. In other words, you will 
very quickly feel the symptoms of anxiety that the drug relieved, but many 
of these symptoms could be due to the effects of withdrawing from the 
drug. Finally, many people relapse when they stop taking benzodiazepines. 
For all of these reasons, you should work very closely with your doctor as 
you cut back on using the drug.</p><p class="cl-cluster">BuSpar does not seem to have many of the problems with dependence and 
withdrawal found with the benzodiazepines, but it is the impression of 
many physicians that its anxiety-reducing effects are not as strong, either. 
Since very few research studies have been done, we can't say for sure what 
the effects are. In any case, many doctors recommend anti-anxiety drugs 
only for short-term relief during a particularly anxious period. The purpose of the drugs would be to help you get through a difficult situation. 
After the situation is resolved, you would stop taking the drug so that you 
would not become dependent on it.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Antidepressant Drugs with Anxiety-Reducing Properties</p><p class="cl-cluster">There is wide agreement that antidepressant drugs that have anxietyreducing properties are the first choice in drug treatment for GAD. The 
most popular of these drugs are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs), as well as the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). 
Most of these drugs seem approximately equal in effectiveness for GAD, 
particularly when combined with the type of program presented in this 
book. The major difficulty with these drugs is that they can take three weeks 
or more to he effective, and you may experience some relatively minor side 
effects during that three-week period, which, to some people, seem very similar to anxiety. A more important and widespread side effect of these drugs 
is sexual dysfunction. Nevertheless, all things considered, these drugs are the best choice at this time for GAD. Drugs of this type that have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of GAD include paroxetine (Paxil), 
venlafaxine (Effexor), and escitalopram (Lexapro). Both Paxil and Effexor 
come in extended-release tablets, which means that you can take fewer pills 
per day. Recommended starting dosages of each of these drugs, as well as the 
dosage range (which means the amount of drug that you would want to be 
taking to get the full therapeutic effects), are listed in table ii.i. If you are 
taking one of these drugs, but not within the recommended dosage range, 
you may want to check with your doctor to find out why. He or she may 
have a good reason, but sometimes doctors are reluctant to prescribe a higher 
dosage of a drug, even though all of the research shows that you really don't 
get the benefit from the drug outside of the therapeutic dosage range. Some 
other antidepressant drugs with anxiety-reducing properties that probably 
have similar effects, but have not been approved by the FDA for the treat- ment of GAD, mostly because the companies making them have not yet 
submitted these drugs for approval, are also listed in table ii.i. The drugs 
that you have most likely heard of include fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline 
(Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa), and fluvoxamine (Luvox). Once again, these 
drugs are probably just about as effective as the drugs approved by the FDA, 
but some individuals tolerate one of these drugs better than another, and 
sometimes your doctor will need to try several different drugs to find out 
which one is best for you.</p><div id="calibre_link-161" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Table 11.1. Drug Treatments for Generalized Anxiety Disordera</p><p class="cl-cluster"><img src="images/000154.svg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p><p class="cl-cluster">'Modified from Goodman (2004).</p><p class="cl-cluster">Abbreviations: FDA, U.S.Food and Drug Administration; GAO, generalized anxiety disorder; SNRI, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; TCA, tricyclic antidepressant.</p><div id="calibre_link-162" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Sometimes, an older class of antidepressant medications, tricyclic antidepressants, is prescribed for anxiety, including drugs such as imipramine (Tofranil) 
and clomipramine (Anafranil). The effectiveness of these drugs is approximately equal to that of the SSRI or SNRI drugs mentioned earlier, but they 
seem to have more side effects for some people, and the side effects strongly 
resemble anxiety. Although the side effects stop after two to three weeks, 
many people have trouble getting through that period. It is much easier to 
stop taking these drugs than it is to stop taking the benzodiazepines. Nevertheless, relapse rates approach 50% in the six months after discontinuation 
of the drug.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Beta-Blockers</p><p class="cl-cluster">Many people take beta-blockers in order to reduce their blood pressure or 
regulate their heart rate. These drugs act on a specific receptor, the betareceptor, which is involved in physiological arousal. Therefore, if one needs 
to avoid physiological arousal for medical reasons, beta-blockers are often 
prescribed. Again, there are a large number of beta-blockers available, but 
the most popular is propranolol (Inderal). One would think that any medication that reduces arousal, which is so much a part of anxiety, would have 
some beneficial effect. Nevertheless, there is very little, if any, evidence that 
Inderal is useful in any way for anxiety, although occasionally, someone 
might feel a little better. For that reason, psychiatrists who are knowledgeable about the drug treatment of anxiety almost never prescribe this drug 
to treat anxiety.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Stopping Your Drug Use</p><p class="cl-cluster">Now that you have completed this program, you should be ready to stop 
your medication if you want to. Chances are you already have done so. If 
not, be very sure that you stop taking your medication under the super vision of your physician; only he or she can decide how soon it will be safe 
for you to taper your medication to the point where you eliminate it altogether. This will be particularly true for drugs (such as Xanax) that are very 
hard to stop taking. Nevertheless, with what you have learned from this program, you should have little trouble stopping your medication if you follow these guidelines.</p><div id="calibre_link-163" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">I.Withdraw from your medication relatively slowly. Don't try to do it 
all at once. Once again, your doctor will be able to give you the best 
advice on what rate (schedule) of withdrawal is appropriate for you.</p><p class="cl-cluster">2.Set a target date for stopping your medication altogether. Once again, 
this will have to be planned with your physician, so make it a reasonable date, in view of your own withdrawal (tapering) schedule. On 
the other hand, the date should not be too far away. Generally, the 
quicker, the better, as long as it is within a schedule that is reasonable 
for you, as determined by your physician.</p><p class="cl-cluster">3.Use the principles and coping skills that you have learned in this program as you withdraw from the medication.</p><p class="cl-cluster">The reason that we have not addressed this topic until now is because it is 
important for you to learn how to master your anxiety and worry before 
successfully stopping your medication. One of the major reasons for this is 
that you may begin to experience anxiety at somewhat more intense levels 
as you withdraw from medication, particularly if you were taking minor 
tranquilizers. If you were never taking medication, then you have mastered 
your anxiety by now. If you are taking medication, the principles you have 
learned may need to be applied again as you experience some anxiety when 
you stop your medication. Once again, most people do not find this a problem, and generally reduce their medication use as they become more comfortable in dealing with their anxiety using this program. These people never 
experience a series of new outbreaks of anxiety as they withdraw from their 
medication. However, if, for some reason, your anxiety seems to be increasing, particularly if you are withdrawing from one of the benzodiazepines, 
you should be reassured by the fact that this will only last a week or two, at 
most, until the drug clears from your system. In addition, you now have 
the skills to handle this anxiety, and perhaps eliminate it entirely.</p><p class="cl-cluster">If withdrawal from benzodiazepines or other medications is posing a particular problem in your life, and is something you have tried before, unsuc cessfully, while working with your physician, then the book Stopping Anxiety Medication may be useful for you. That particular program is designed 
specifically for panic attacks, as well as symptoms of very severe anxiety and 
panic that one feels when attempting to withdraw from benzodiazepines or 
other drugs.</p><div id="calibre_link-164" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>

"Number of anxiety episodes" on your Self-Evaluation form. If the number of episodes has not reduced or has increased, check the "No" box. Similarly, examine the maximum anxiety ratings for each week, from the beginning of monitoring to the end of monitoring. If you have experienced 
what you consider to be a significant reduction in how anxious you are during the day, check the "Yes" box next to the item labeled "Maximum daily 
anxiety." If your average maximum anxiety ratings have not changed, or 
have increased, check the "No" box.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Next, think about the catastrophic images that you repeatedly faced in 
chapter 8. Compare your initial anxiety ratings with the level of anxiety 
that you now experience when imagining these scenes. If your anxiety level has reduced, check the "Yes" box next to the item labeled "Catastrophic 
images." Check "No" if your anxiety in relation to these images has not 
decreased.</p><div id="calibre_link-165" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Self-Evaluation</p><p class="cl-cluster"><img src="images/000157.svg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p><p class="cl-cluster">Finally, consider the list of behavioral changes that you identified as ways 
of replacing anxious behaviors. Rate your level of anxiety now for each behavioral change. If your level of anxiety is significantly less than when you 
first rated those behavioral changes (chapter 9), check the "Yes" box next 
to the item labeled "Anxious behaviors"; if not, check "No."</p><p class="cl-cluster">If you have checked the "Yes" box for at least two of the four items, then 
you have progressed very well with this program. If, on the other hand, you 
have checked "No" to three or more of the items, then there is still room 
for gains to be made.</p><p class="cl-cluster">What to Do Next</p><p class="cl-cluster">On the basis of your Self-Evaluation, decide whether you have responded 
well to the program or whether you have room to make more improvements. If you feel good about your level of progress, then your strategy 
should be to identify any remaining areas of concern and to continue with 
the same principles and strategies that you have been taught up until this 
point. Think of any remaining difficulties with the way you react to events 
(any tendencies to overestimate the risk or to catastrophize), repetitive worries that you find bothersome and difficult to get rid of, or excessive caution in your behavior. Review the appropriate chapters to help you with 
these remaining areas.</p><div id="calibre_link-166" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">If, on the other hand, you decide that you still have a long way to go, evaluate the following possible reasons why you may not have done as well with 
the program as you would have liked:</p><p class="cl-cluster">The initial decision that this program was appropriate for you may not 
have been accurate. This is likely the case if you found that much of 
the material in the program did not seem relevant to the kinds of 
problems that you are encountering. In this case, you should discuss 
with your doctor or mental health professional the need for further 
assessment to identify a more appropriate program.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Some people simply need a longer time to complete the program, depending on various factors. Requiring a longer time is not an indication of 
lack of success with the program, but simply an indication of the need 
for continued application of the strategies, as described. This possibility 
would be most likely if you have experienced some improvement, although not as much as you would like. If so, continue applying the 
strategies. If absolutely no progress has been made, then the first possibility may be more likely.</p><p class="cl-cluster">The program is appropriate, but the amount of effort you have put in 
has not been sufficient. This is the most common reason for lack of 
success. Have you practiced regularly and sufficiently? Perhaps events 
have occurred that have taken your attention away from the program 
(such as a family crisis or marital problems). If so, the success of the 
program simply depends on renewed effort and motivation. If motivation is a more general issue (you have not practiced regularly, despite 
having the time to do so), then it may he better to stop the and return 
to it when you are feeling more motivated.</p><p class="cl-cluster">The fourth possibility is that you have not fully understood the major 
principles of this program. In this case, a review of all of the principles, preferably with the help of your doctor or mental health professional, is suggested.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Finally, lack of success may be a function of the way in which you are 
defining success. Remember, success is change in the right direction, 
no matter how small. If you are waiting for a time when you feel absolutely no anxiety, worry, or tension, you are most likely using unrealistic standards of success. Change is gradual, and some anxiety is 
necessary.</p><div id="calibre_link-167" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Planning to Maintain Your Gains</p><p class="cl-cluster">If you have done well with this program, or are still in the process of 
achieving control by continued use of the strategies, one issue to keep in 
mind is how to maintain, or keep up, the changes that you have made. 
Sometimes people ask, "Will I always be anxious?" or "Has this program 
simply taught me how to suppress an underlying anxiety that will always 
be part of me?" To respond to the first question, it is important to remember that anxiety is a perfectly normal human trait; all of us experience anxiety, and in fact, as we discussed earlier, it would be unadaptive 
to completely remove anxiety from our lives because it plays such a big 
role in motivation for performance. Learning to control excessive levels of 
anxiety is like any other learned behavior; once the way to achieve control is learned, then that behavior becomes more powerful with time. 
However, there are some situations that may increase the likelihood of 
experiencing high levels of anxiety in the future (discussed below).</p><p class="cl-cluster">To respond to the second question, it is important to understand that the 
goal of this program is not to suppress anxiety. Instead, the methods you 
have been taught are intended to change the way you react so that you no 
longer experience excessive anxiety. You are learning to reach the core of 
your anxiety reactions and to change them. Always keep in mind that anxiety is an emotional response that is made up of certain key features and 
processes, such as physical arousal, patterns of thought, and avoidance behaviors. By changing these components of your anxiety response, your anxiety itself is changed.</p><p class="cl-cluster">Certain key factors will promote the continuation of the accomplishments 
that you've made during the program. First, whenever you notice yourself 
worrying about something over and over again, or worrying to the extent 
that it is difficult to stop, use this as a signal to evaluate your thoughts. Take 
a step out of the anxiety cycle to examine what you are saying to yourself, 
how likely it is, and what is the worst that can happen. Remember to become an observer rather than a victim. Second, if you notice physical tension building in your body, such as headaches or backaches, practice the 
relaxation strategy. Finally, watch out for the subtle behaviors that are based 
on worrisome thoughts, such as watching for news stories about car accidents, and so on. In summary, act on your signals of anxiety, worry, and 
tension, rather than letting them take over your whole being. It is helpful, and generally a good idea, to review the material in the various chapters on 
occasion.</p><div id="calibre_link-168" title="pagetype_txt" class="calibre1"></div>
<p class="cl-cluster">Also, don't view an episode of high anxiety as evidence or loss of all of the 
gains that you've made. That's the time when you must become an objective observer, outside of the bowl of gelatin, examining the reasons why you 
became so anxious, so that the appropriate strategies for anxiety management can be applied.</p><p class="cl-cluster">High-Risk Times</p><p class="cl-cluster">From our work, we have found that the likelihood of experiencing high 
levels of anxiety again increases at times when you experience a lot of stress. 
This might include positive stress (such as a job promotion or having a new 
baby) or negative stress (such as losing someone close to you). High levels 
of stress might lead you to feel more physical tension, since you are likely 
to be more physically aroused. Along with the physical tension, you might 
experience an increase in your worry. The key is to remember the strategies 
for dealing with the worry and tension.</p><div id="calibre_link-13" title="pagetype_bmatter" class="calibre1"></div>
