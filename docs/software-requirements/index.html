<div class="calibre1" id="calibre_link-2"><section title="Introduction" type="preface" id="calibre_link-2574"><div class="titlepage" id="calibre_link-2575"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title1">Introduction</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-681" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1366" class="calibre"></a>Despite decades of industry experience, many software
    organizations struggle to understand, document, and manage their product
    requirements. Inadequate user input, incomplete requirements, changing
    requirements, and misunderstood business objectives are major reasons why
    so many information technology projects are less than fully successful.
    Some software teams aren’t proficient at eliciting requirements from
    customers and other sources. Customers often don’t have the time or
    patience to participate in requirements activities. In many cases, project
    participants don’t even agree on what a “requirement” is. As one writer
    observed, “Engineers would rather decipher the words to the Kingsmen’s
    1963 classic party song ‘Louie Louie’ than decipher customer requirements”
    (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-3">[ref184]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3">The second edition of <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Software Requirements</em></span> was
    published 10 years prior to this one. Ten years is a long time in the
    technology world. Many things have changed in that time, but others have
    not. Major requirements trends in the past decade include:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The recognition of business analysis as a professional
        discipline and the rise of professional certifications and
        organizations, such as the International Institute of Business
        Analysis and the International Requirements Engineering Board.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The maturing of tools both for managing requirements in a
        database and for assisting with requirements development activities
        such as prototyping, modeling, and simulation.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The increased use of agile development methods and the evolution
        of techniques for handling requirements on agile projects.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The increased use of visual models to represent requirements
        knowledge.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">So, what <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">hasn’t</em></span> changed? Two factors contribute
    to keeping this topic important and relevant. First, many undergraduate
    curricula in software engineering and computer science continue to
    underemphasize the importance of requirements engineering (which
    encompasses both requirements development and requirements management).
    And second, those of us in the software domain tend to be enamored with
    technical and process solutions to our challenges. We sometimes fail to
    appreciate that requirements elicitation&mdash;and much of software and systems
    project work in general&mdash;is primarily a human interaction challenge. No
    magical new techniques have come along to automate that, although various
    tools are available to help geographically separated people collaborate
    effectively.</p><p class="calibre3">We believe that the practices presented in the second edition for
    developing and managing requirements are still valid and applicable to a
    wide range of software projects. The creative business analyst, product
    manager, or product owner will thoughtfully adapt and scale the practices
    to best meet the needs of a particular situation. Newly added to this
    third edition are a chapter on handling requirements for agile projects
    and sections in numerous other chapters that describe how to apply and
    adapt the practices in those chapters to the agile development
    environment.</p><p class="calibre3">Software development involves at least as much communication as it
    does computing, yet both educational curricula and project activities
    often emphasize the computing over the communication aspect. This book
    offers dozens of tools to facilitate that communication and to help
    software practitioners, managers, marketers, and customers apply effective
    requirements engineering methods. The techniques presented here constitute
    a tool kit of mainstream “good practices,” not exotic new techniques or an
    elaborate methodology that purports to solve all of your requirements
    problems. Numerous anecdotes and sidebars present stories&mdash;all true&mdash;that
    illustrate typical requirements-related experiences; you have likely had
    similar experiences. Look for the “true stories” icon, like the one to the
    left, next to real examples drawn from many project experiences.</p><p class="calibre3">Since the first edition of this book appeared in 1999, we have each
    worked on numerous projects and taught hundreds of classes on software
    requirements to people from companies and government agencies of all sizes
    and types. We’ve learned that these practices are useful on virtually any
    project: small projects and large, new development and enhancements, with
    local and distributed teams, and using traditional and agile development
    methods. The techniques apply to hardware and systems engineering
    projects, too, not just software projects. As with any other technical
    practice, you’ll need to use good judgment and experience to learn how to
    make the methods work best for you. Think of these practices as tools to
    help ensure that you have effective conversations with the right people on
    your projects.</p><div class="book" title="Benefits this book provides"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="calibre5"></div><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2576">Benefits this book provides</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Of all the software process improvements you could undertake,
      improved requirements practices are among the most beneficial. We
      describe practical, proven techniques that can help you to:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Write high-quality requirements from the outset of a project,
          thereby minimizing rework and maximizing productivity.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Deliver high-quality information systems and commercial
          products that achieve their business objectives.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Manage scope creep and requirements changes to stay both on
          target and under control.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Achieve higher customer satisfaction.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Reduce maintenance, enhancement, and support costs.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Our objective is to help you improve the processes you use for
      eliciting and analyzing requirements, writing and validating
      requirements specifications, and managing the requirements throughout
      the software product development cycle. The techniques we describe are
      pragmatic and realistic. Both of us have used these very techniques many
      times, and we always get good results when we do.</p></div><div class="book" title="Who should read this book"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2577">Who should read this book</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Anyone involved with defining or understanding the requirements
      for any system that contains software will find useful information here.
      The primary audience consists of individuals who serve as business
      analysts or requirements engineers on a development project, be they
      full-time specialists or other team members who sometimes fill the
      analyst role. A second audience includes the architects, designers,
      developers, testers, and other technical team members who must
      understand and satisfy user expectations and participate in the creation
      and review of effective requirements. Marketers and product managers who
      are charged with specifying the features and attributes that will make a
      product a commercial success will find these practices valuable. Project
      managers will learn how to plan and track the project’s requirements
      activities and deal with requirements changes. Yet another audience is
      made up of stakeholders who participate in defining a product that meets
      their business, functional, and quality needs. This book will help end
      users, customers who procure or contract for software products, and
      numerous other stakeholders understand the importance of the
      requirements process and their roles in it.</p></div><div class="book" title="Looking ahead"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2578">Looking ahead</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">This book is organized into five parts. <a class="xref" title="Part I. Software requirements: What, why, and who" href="#calibre_link-4">Part&nbsp;I</a> begins with some
      definitions. If you’re on the technical side of the house, please share
      <a class="xref" title="Chapter 2. Requirements from the customer’s perspective" href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>, on the
      customer-development partnership, with your key customers. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 3. Good practices for requirements engineering" href="#calibre_link-6">Chapter&nbsp;3</a> summarizes several
      dozen “good practices” for requirements development and management, as
      well as an overall process framework for requirements development. The
      role of the business analyst (a role that also goes by many other names)
      is the subject of <a class="xref" title="Chapter 4. The business analyst" href="#calibre_link-7">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Part II. Requirements development" href="#calibre_link-8">Part&nbsp;II</a> begins with
      techniques for defining the project’s business requirements. Other
      chapters in <a class="xref" title="Part II. Requirements development" href="#calibre_link-8">Part&nbsp;II</a> address
      how to find appropriate customer representatives, elicit requirements
      from them, and document user requirements, business rules, functional
      requirements, data requirements, and nonfunctional requirements. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 12. A picture is worth 1024 words" href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter&nbsp;12</a> describes numerous visual
      models that represent the requirements from various perspectives to
      supplement natural-language text, and <a class="xref" title="Chapter 15. Risk reduction through prototyping" href="#calibre_link-10">Chapter&nbsp;15</a> addresses the use of
      prototypes to reduce risk. Other chapters in <a class="xref" title="Part II. Requirements development" href="#calibre_link-8">Part&nbsp;II</a> present ways to
      prioritize, validate, and reuse requirements. <a class="xref" title="Part II. Requirements development" href="#calibre_link-8">Part&nbsp;II</a> concludes by describing
      how requirements affect other aspects of project work.</p><p class="calibre3">New to this edition, <a class="xref" title="Part III. Requirements for specific project classes" href="#calibre_link-11">Part&nbsp;III</a> contains chapters
      that recommend the most effective requirements approaches for various
      specific classes of projects: agile projects developing products of any
      type, enhancement and replacement projects, projects that incorporate
      packaged solutions, outsourced projects, business process automation
      projects, business analytics projects, and embedded and other real-time
      systems.</p><p class="calibre3">The principles and practices of requirements management are the
      subject of <a class="xref" title="Part IV. Requirements management" href="#calibre_link-12">Part&nbsp;IV</a>, with
      emphasis on techniques for dealing with changing requirements. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 29. Links in the requirements chain" href="#calibre_link-13">Chapter&nbsp;29</a> describes how requirements
      tracing connects individual requirements both to their origins and to
      downstream development deliverables. <a class="xref" title="Part IV. Requirements management" href="#calibre_link-12">Part&nbsp;IV</a> concludes with a
      description of commercial tools that can enhance the way your teams
      conduct both requirements development and requirements
      management.</p><p class="calibre3">The final section of this book, <a class="xref" title="Part V. Implementing requirements engineering" href="#calibre_link-14">Part&nbsp;V</a> helps you move from
      concepts to practice. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 31. Improving your requirements processes" href="#calibre_link-15">Chapter&nbsp;31</a> will help you
      incorporate new requirements techniques into your group’s development
      process. Common requirements-related project risks are described in
      <a class="xref" title="Chapter 32. Software requirements and risk management" href="#calibre_link-16">Chapter&nbsp;32</a>. The
      self-assessment in <a class="xref" title="Appendix B. Current requirements practice self-assessment" href="#calibre_link-17">Appendix&nbsp;B</a> can help you
      select areas that are ripe for improvement. Two other appendices present
      a requirements troubleshooting guide and several sample requirements
      documents so you can see how the pieces all fit together.</p></div><div class="book" title="Case studies"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2579">Case studies</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">To illustrate the methods described in this book, we have provided
      examples from several case studies based on actual projects,
      particularly a medium-sized information system called the Chemical
      Tracking System. Don’t worry&mdash;you don’t need to know anything about
      chemistry to understand this project. Sample discussions among
      participants from the case studies are sprinkled throughout the book. No
      matter what kind of software your organization builds, you’ll be able to
      relate to these dialogs.</p></div><div class="book" title="From principles to practice"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2580">From principles to practice</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">It’s difficult to muster the energy needed for overcoming
      obstacles to change and putting new knowledge into action. As an aid for
      your journey to improved requirements, most chapters end with several
      “next steps,” actions you can take to begin applying the contents of
      that chapter immediately. Various chapters offer suggested templates for
      requirements documents, a review checklist, a requirements
      prioritization spreadsheet, a change control process, and many other
      process assets. These items are available for downloading at the
      companion content website for this book:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4"><a class="xref" href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/software-requirements-9780735679665" target="_top">https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/software-requirements-9780735679665</a></em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">Use them to jump-start your application of these techniques. Start
      with small improvements, but start today.</p><p class="calibre3">Some people will be reluctant to try new requirements techniques.
      Use this book to educate your peers, your customers, and your managers.
      Remind them of requirements-related problems encountered on previous
      projects, and discuss the potential benefits of trying some new
      approaches.</p><p class="calibre3">You don’t need to launch a new development project to begin
      applying better requirements practices. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 21. Enhancement and replacement projects" href="#calibre_link-18">Chapter&nbsp;21</a> discusses ways to
      apply many of the techniques to enhancement and replacement projects.
      Implementing requirements practices incrementally is a low-risk process
      improvement approach that will prepare you for the next major
      project.</p><p class="calibre3">The goal of requirements development is to accumulate a set of
      requirements that are <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">good enough</em></span> to allow your
      team to proceed with design and construction of the next portion of the
      product at an acceptable level of risk. You need to devote enough
      attention to requirements to minimize the risks of rework, unacceptable
      products, and blown schedules. This book gives you the tools to get the
      right people to collaborate on developing the right requirements for the
      right product.</p></div><div class="book" title="Errata &amp; book support"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="calibre5"></div><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2581">Errata &amp; book support</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">We’ve made every effort to ensure the accuracy of this book and its companion content.

    review the full manuscript and offer countless suggestions for
    improvement; they have our deep gratitude. We especially appreciate the
    invaluable comments from Jim Brosseau, Joan Davis, Gary K. Evans, Joyce
    Grapes, Tina Heidenreich, Kelly Morrison Smith, and Dr. Joyce Statz.
    Additional review input was received from Kevin Brennan, Steven Davis,
    Anne Hartley, Emily Iem, Matt Leach, Jeannine McConnell, Yaaqub Mohamed,
    and John Parker. Certain individuals reviewed specific chapters or
    sections in their areas of expertise, often providing highly detailed
    comments. We thank Tanya Charbury, Mike Cohn, Dr. Alex Dean, Ellen
    Gottesdiener, Shane Hastie, James Hulgan, Dr. Phil Koopman, Mark Kulak,
    Shirley Sartin, Rob Siciliano, and Betsy Stockdale. We especially thank
    Roxanne Miller and Stephen Withall for their deep insights and generous
    participation.</p><p class="calibre3">We discussed aspects of the book’s topics with many people, learning

    and Ganeshbabu G. Karl especially values his long-term relationship, and
    friendship, with Devon Musgrave and Ben Ryan.</p><p class="calibre3">The comments and questions from thousands of students in our
    requirements training classes over the years have been most helpful in
    stimulating our thinking about requirements issues. Our consulting
    experiences and the thought-provoking questions we receive from readers
    have kept us in touch with what practitioners struggle with on a daily
    basis and helped us think through some of these difficult topics. Please

    always, she was patient and good-humored throughout the process. Karl also
    thanks Joy for prompting him into working on this project and for her
    terrific contributions. Working with her was a lot of fun, and she added a
    great deal of value to the book. It was great to have someone to bounce
    ideas off, to help make difficult decisions, and to chew hard on draft
    chapters before we inflicted them on the reviewers.</p><p class="calibre3">Joy is particularly grateful to her husband, Tony Hamilton, for
    supporting her writing dreams so soon again; to her daughter, Skye, for
    making it easy to keep her daily priorities balanced; and to Sean and
    Estelle for being the center of her family fun times. Joy wants to extend
    a special thanks to all of the Seilevel employees who collaborate to push
    the software requirements field forward. She particularly wants to thank
    two colleagues and friends: Anthony Chen, whose support for her writing
    this book was paramount; and Rob Sparks, for his continued encouragement
    in such endeavors. Finally, Joy owes a great deal of gratitude to Karl for
    allowing her to join him in this co-authorship, teaching her something new
    every day, and being an absolute joy to work with!</p></section></div>

      you fix the bug by then?”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“It’s not a bug!” Phil retorted. “I never knew you
      needed this capability. I’m busy on the new performance evaluation
      system. I can probably fix it by the end of the month, but not by
      Friday. Sorry about that. Next time, tell me these things earlier and
      please write them down.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“What am I supposed to tell Sparkle?” demanded Maria.
      “She’ll be upset if she can’t cash her check.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“Hey, Maria, it’s not my fault,” Phil protested. “If
      you’d told me in the first place that you had to be able to change
      someone’s name at any time, this wouldn’t have happened. You can’t blame
      me for not reading your mind.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Angry and resigned, Maria snapped, “Yeah, well, this is
      the kind of thing that makes me hate computers. Call me as soon as you
      get it fixed, will you?”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">If you’ve ever been on the customer side of a conversation like
      this, you know how frustrating it is when a software system doesn’t let
      you perform an essential task. You hate to be at the mercy of a
      developer who <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">might</em></span> get to your critical change
      request eventually. On the other hand, developers are frustrated to
      learn about functionality that a user expected only after they’ve
      implemented the system. It’s also annoying for a developer to have his
      current project interrupted by a request to modify a system that does
      precisely what he was told it should do in the first place.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-616" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2587" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1723" class="calibre"></a>Many problems in the software world arise from
      shortcomings in the ways that people learn about, document, agree upon
      and modify the product’s requirements. As with Phil and Maria, common
      problem areas are informal information gathering, implied functionality,
      miscommunicated assumptions, poorly specified requirements, and a casual
      change process. Various studies suggest that errors introduced during
      requirements activities account for 40 to 50 percent of all defects
      found in a software product (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-23">[ref056]</a>). Inadequate user
      input and shortcomings in specifying and managing customer requirements
      are major contributors to unsuccessful projects. Despite this evidence,
      many organizations still practice ineffective requirements
      methods.</p><p class="calibre3">Nowhere more than in the requirements do the interests of all the
      stakeholders in a project intersect. (See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 2. Requirements from the customer’s perspective" href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter&nbsp;2</a> for more about
      stakeholders.) These stakeholders include customers, users, business
      analysts, developers, and many others. Handled well, this intersection
      can lead to delighted customers and fulfilled developers. Handled
      poorly, it’s the source of misunderstanding and friction that undermine
      the product’s quality and business value. Because requirements are the
      foundation for both the software development and the project management
      activities, all stakeholders should commit to applying requirements
      practices that are known to yield superior-quality products.</p><p class="calibre3">But developing and managing requirements is hard! There are no
      simple shortcuts or magic solutions. On the plus side, so many
      organizations struggle with the same problems that you can look for
      techniques in common that apply to many different situations. This book
      describes dozens of such practices. The practices are presented as
      though you were building a brand-new system. However, most of them also
      apply to enhancement, replacement, and reengineering projects (see <a class="xref" title="Chapter 21. Enhancement and replacement projects" href="#calibre_link-18">Chapter&nbsp;21</a>) and to projects that
      incorporate commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) packaged solutions (see
      <a class="xref" title="Chapter 22. Packaged solution projects" href="#calibre_link-24">Chapter&nbsp;22</a>). Project teams that build
      products incrementally by following an agile development process also
      need to understand the requirements that go into each increment (see

        start with a terminology problem. Different observers might describe a
        single statement as being a user requirement, software requirement,
        business requirement, functional requirement, system requirement,
        product requirement, project requirement, user story, feature, or
        constraint. The names they use for various requirements deliverables
        also vary. A customer’s definition of requirements might sound like a
        high-level product concept to the developer. The developer’s notion of
        requirements might sound like a detailed user interface design to the
        user. This diversity of understanding leads to confusion and
        frustration.</p><div class="book" title="Some interpretations of “requirement”"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2591">Some interpretations of “requirement”</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1449" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2071" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2164" class="calibre"></a>Many decades after the invention of computer
          programming, software practitioners still have raging debates about
          exactly what a “requirement” is. Rather than prolong those debates,
          in this book we simply present some definitions that we have found
          useful.</p><p class="calibre3">Consultant Brian Lawrence suggests that a
          <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">requirement</em></span> is “anything that drives design
          choices” (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-26">[ref154]</a>). This is not a bad colloquial
          definition, because many kinds of information fit in this category.
          And, after all, the whole point of developing requirements is to
          make appropriate design choices that will meet the customer’s needs
          in the end. Another definition is that a requirement is a property
          that a product must have to provide value to a stakeholder. Also not
          bad, but not very precise. Our favorite definition, though, comes
          from <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-27">[ref223]</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Requirements are a specification of what should be
            implemented. They are descriptions of how the system should
            behave, or of a system property or attribute. They may be a
            constraint on the development process of the
            system.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">This definition acknowledges the diverse types of information
          that collectively are referred to as “the requirements.”
          Requirements encompass both the user’s view of the external system
          behavior and the developer’s view of some internal characteristics.
          They include both the behavior of the system under specific
          conditions and those properties that make the system suitable&mdash;and
          maybe even enjoyable&mdash;for use by its intended operators.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-2592" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Don’t assume that all your project stakeholders share a
            common notion of what requirements are. Establish definitions up
            front so that you’re all talking about the same things.</p></div><div class="book" title="The pure dictionary “requirement”"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2593">The pure dictionary “requirement”</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Software people do not use “requirement” in the same sense
            as a dictionary definition of the word: something demanded or
            obligatory, a need or necessity. People sometimes question whether
            they even need to prioritize requirements, because maybe a
            low-priority requirement won’t ever be implemented. If it isn’t
            truly needed, then it isn’t a requirement, they claim. Perhaps,
            but then what would you call that piece of information? If you
            defer a requirement from today’s project to an unspecified future
            release, is it still considered a requirement? Sure it is.</p><p class="calibre3">Software requirements include a time dimension. They could
            be present tense, describing the current system’s capabilities. Or
            they could be for the near-term (high priority), mid-term (medium
            priority), or hypothetical (low priority) future. They could even
            be past tense, referring to needs that were once specified and
            then discarded. Don’t waste time debating whether or not something
            is a requirement, even if you know you might never implement it
            for some good business reason. It is.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Levels and types of requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2594">Levels and types of requirements</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-664" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-735" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-756" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-878" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1204" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1235" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1280" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1302" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1394" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1455" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1574" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1579" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1829" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1950" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2139" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2237" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2318" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2444" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2449" class="calibre"></a>Because there are so many different types of

          or tasks the users must be able to perform with the product that
          will provide value to someone. The domain of user requirements also
          includes descriptions of product attributes or characteristics that
          are important to user satisfaction. Ways to represent user
          requirements include use cases (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-33">[ref146]</a>), user
          stories (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-34">[ref043]</a>), and event-response tables.
          Ideally, actual user representatives will provide this information.
          User requirements describe <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">what</em></span> the user will
          be able to do with the system. An example of a use case is “Check in
          for a flight” using an airline’s website or a kiosk at the airport.
          Written as a user story, the same user requirement might read: “As a
          passenger, I want to check in for a flight so I can board my
          airplane.” It’s important to remember that most projects have
          multiple user classes, as well as other stakeholders whose needs
          also must be elicited. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 8. Understanding user requirements" href="#calibre_link-35">Chapter&nbsp;8</a> addresses this level of
          the model. Some people use the broader term “stakeholder
          requirements,” to acknowledge the reality that various stakeholders
          other than direct users will provide requirements. That is certainly
          true, but we focus the attention at this level on understanding what
          actual users need to achieve with the help of the product.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Functional requirements</em></span> specify the
          behaviors the product will exhibit under specific conditions. They
          describe <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">what</em></span> the developers must implement to
          enable users to accomplish their tasks (user requirements), thereby
          satisfying the business requirements. This alignment among the three
          levels of requirements is essential for project success. Functional
          requirements often are written in the form of the traditional
          “shall” statements: “The Passenger shall be able to print boarding
          passes for all flight segments for which he has checked in” or “If
          the Passenger’s profile does not indicate a seating preference, the
          reservation system shall assign a seat.”</p><p class="calibre3">The business analyst (BA)<sup class="calibre18">[<a id="calibre_link-63" type="noteref" class="calibre" href="#calibre_link-36">1</a>]</sup> documents functional requirements in a
          <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">software requirements specification</em></span> (SRS),
          which describes as fully as necessary the expected behavior of the
          software system. The SRS is used in development, testing, quality
          assurance, project management, and related project functions. People
          call this deliverable by many different names, including business
          requirements document, functional spec, requirements document, and
          others. An SRS could be a report generated from information stored
          in a requirements management tool. Because it is an
          industry-standard term, we will use “SRS” consistently throughout
          this book (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-37">[ref124]</a>). See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 10. Documenting the requirements" href="#calibre_link-38">Chapter&nbsp;10</a> for more information about
          the SRS.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">System requirements</em></span> describe the
          requirements for a product that is composed of multiple components
          or subsystems (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-37">[ref124]</a>). A “system” in this sense
          is not just any information system. A system can be all software or
          it can include both software and hardware subsystems. People and
          processes are part of a system, too, so certain system functions
          might be allocated to human beings. Some people use the term “system
          requirements” to mean the detailed requirements for a software
          system, but that’s not how we use the term in this book.</p><p class="calibre3">A good example of a “system” is the cashier’s workstation in a
          supermarket. There’s a bar code scanner integrated with a scale, as
          well as a hand-held bar code scanner. The cashier has a keyboard, a
          display, and a cash drawer. You’ll see a card reader and PIN pad for
          your loyalty card and credit or debit card, and perhaps a change
          dispenser. You might see up to three printers for your purchase
          receipt, credit card receipt, and coupons you don’t care about.
          These hardware devices are all interacting under software control.
          The requirements for the system or product as a whole, then, lead
          the business analyst to derive specific functionality that must be
          allocated to one or another of those component subsystems, as well
          as demanding an understanding of the interfaces between them.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-757" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-879" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1395" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1399" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1461" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1575" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1820" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1830" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Business rules</em></span> include corporate
          policies, government regulations, industry standards, and
          computational algorithms. As you’ll see in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 9. Playing by the rules" href="#calibre_link-39">Chapter&nbsp;9</a> business rules are not themselves
          software requirements because they have an existence beyond the
          boundaries of any specific software application. However, they often
          dictate that the system must contain functionality to comply with
          the pertinent rules. Sometimes, as with corporate security policies,
          business rules are the origin of specific quality attributes that
          are then implemented in functionality. Therefore, you can trace the
          genesis of certain functional requirements back to a particular
          business rule.</p><p class="calibre3">In addition to functional requirements, the SRS contains an
          assortment of nonfunctional requirements. <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Quality
          attributes</em></span> are also known as quality factors, quality of
          service requirements, constraints, and the “&ndash;ilities.” They describe
          the product’s characteristics in various dimensions that are
          important either to users or to developers and maintainers, such as
          performance, safety, availability, and portability. Other classes of
          nonfunctional requirements describe <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">external
          interfaces</em></span> between the system and the outside world.
          These include connections to other software systems, hardware
          components, and users, as well as communication interfaces. Design
          and implementation <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">constraints</em></span> impose
          restrictions on the options available to the developer during
          construction of the product.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2601" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">If they’re nonfunctional, then what are they?</div><p class="calibre3">For many years, the requirements for a software product have
            been classified broadly as either functional or nonfunctional. The
            functional requirements are evident: they describe the observable
            behavior of the system under various conditions. However, many
            people dislike the term “nonfunctional.” That adjective says what
            the requirements are <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">not</em></span>, but it doesn’t say
            what they <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">are</em></span>. We are sympathetic to the
            problem, but we lack a perfect solution.</p><p class="calibre3">Other-than-functional requirements might specify not
            <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">what</em></span> the system does, but rather
            <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">how well</em></span> it does those things. They could
            describe important characteristics or properties of the system.
            These include the system’s availability, usability, security,
            performance, and many other characteristics, as addressed in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 14. Beyond functionality" href="#calibre_link-40">Chapter&nbsp;14</a>. Some people consider
            nonfunctional requirements to be synonymous with quality
            attributes, but that is overly restrictive. For example, design
            and implementation constraints are also nonfunctional
            requirements, as are external interface requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">Still other nonfunctional requirements address the
            environment in which the system operates, such as platform,
            portability, compatibility, and constraints. Many products are
            also affected by compliance, regulatory, and certification
            requirements. There could be localization requirements for
            products that must take into account the cultures, languages,
            laws, currencies, terminology, spelling, and other characteristics
            of users. Though such requirements are specified in nonfunctional
            terms, the business analyst typically will derive numerous bits of
            functionality to ensure that the system possesses all the desired
            behaviors and properties.</p><p class="calibre3">In this book, we are sticking with the term “nonfunctional
            requirements,” despite its limitations, for the lack of a suitably
            inclusive alternative. Rather than worry about precisely what you
            call these sorts of information, just make sure that they are part
            of your requirements elicitation and analysis activities. You can
            deliver a product that has all the desired functionality but that
            users hate because it doesn’t match their (often unstated) quality
            expectations.</p></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1230" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1236" class="calibre"></a>A <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">feature</em></span> consists of one or more
          logically related system capabilities that provide value to a user
          and are described by a set of functional requirements. A customer’s
          list of desired product features is not equivalent to a description
          of the user’s task-related needs. Web browser bookmarks, spelling
          checkers, the ability to define a custom workout program for a piece
          of exercise equipment, and automatic virus signature updating in an
          anti-malware product are examples of features. A feature can
          encompass multiple user requirements, each of which implies that
          certain functional requirements must be implemented to allow the
          user to perform the task described by each user requirement. <a class="xref" title="Figure 1-2. Relationships among features, user requirements, and functional requirements." href="#calibre_link-41">Figure&nbsp;1-2</a> illustrates a
          <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">feature tree</em></span>, an analysis model that shows how
          a feature can be hierarchically decomposed into a set of smaller
          features, which relate to specific user requirements and lead to
          specifying sets of functional requirements (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-42">[ref013]</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-41" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2602" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000002.jpeg" alt="A feature tree diagram shows a main trunk running from                 the product name, in this case a web browser.

          requirements, consider a project to develop the next version of a
          text editor program. A business requirement might be “Increase
          non-US sales by 25 percent within 6 months.” Marketing realizes that
          the competitive products only have English-language spelling
          checkers, so they decide that the new version will include a
          multilanguage spelling checker feature. Corresponding user
          requirements might include tasks such as “Select language for
          spelling checker,” “Find spelling errors,” and “Add a word to a
          dictionary.” The spelling checker has many individual functional
          requirements, which deal with operations such as highlighting
          misspelled words, autocorrect, displaying suggested replacements,
          and globally replacing misspelled words with corrected words.
          Usability requirements specify how the software is to be localized
          for use with specific languages and character sets.</p></div><div class="book" title="Working with the three levels"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2603">Working with the three levels</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 1-3. An example of how different stakeholders participate in requirements development." href="#calibre_link-43">Figure&nbsp;1-3</a>

          the three levels of requirements. Different organizations use a
          variety of names for the roles involved in these activities; think
          about who performs these activities in your organization. The role

          or an exciting new product concept, managers or marketing define the
          business requirements for software that will help their company
          operate more efficiently (for information systems) or compete
          successfully in the marketplace (for commercial products). In the
          corporate environment, a business analyst then typically works with
          user representatives to identify user requirements. Companies
          developing commercial products often identify a product manager to
          determine what features to include in the new product. Each user
          requirement and feature must align with accomplishing the business
          requirements. From the user requirements, the BA or product manager
          derives the functionality that will let users achieve their goals.
          Developers use the functional and nonfunctional requirements to
          design solutions that implement the necessary functionality, within
          the limits that the constraints impose. Testers determine how to
          verify whether the requirements were correctly implemented.</p><p class="calibre3">It’s important to recognize the value of recording vital
          requirements information in a shareable form, rather than treating
          it as oral tradition around the project campfire. I was on a project
          once that had experienced a rotating cast of development teams. The
          primary customer was sick to tears of having each new team come
          along and say, “We have to talk about your requirements.” His
          reaction to our request was, “I already gave your predecessors my
          requirements. Now build me a system!” Unfortunately, no one had ever
          documented any requirements, so every new team had to start from
          scratch. To proclaim that you “have the requirements” is delusional
          if all you really have is a pile of email and voice mail messages,
          sticky notes, meeting minutes, and vaguely recollected hallway
          conversations. The BA must practice good judgment to determine just
          how comprehensive to make the requirements documentation on a given
          project.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 1-1. Relationships among several types of requirements information. Solid arrows mean “are stored in”; dotted arrows mean “are the origin of” or “influence.”" href="#calibre_link-29">Figure&nbsp;1-1</a>,
          shown earlier in this chapter, identified three major requirements
          deliverables: a vision and scope document, a user requirements
          document, and a software requirements specification. You do not
          necessarily need to create three discrete requirements deliverables
          on each project. It often makes sense to combine some of this
          information, particularly on small projects. However, recognize that
          these three deliverables contain different information, developed at
          different points in the project, possibly by different people, with
          different purposes and target audiences.</p><p class="calibre3">The model in <a class="xref" title="Figure 1-1. Relationships among several types of requirements information. Solid arrows mean “are stored in”; dotted arrows mean “are the origin of” or “influence.”" href="#calibre_link-29">Figure&nbsp;1-1</a> showed a
          simple top-down flow of requirements information. In reality, you
          should expect cycles and iteration among the business, user, and
          functional requirements. Whenever someone proposes a new feature,
          user requirement, or bit of functionality, the analyst must ask, “Is
          this in scope?” If the answer is “yes,” the requirement belongs in
          the specification. If the answer is “no,” it does not, at least not
          for the forthcoming release or iteration. The third possible answer
          is “no, but it supports the business objectives, so it ought to be.”
          In that case, whoever controls the project scope&mdash;the project
          sponsor, project manager, or product owner&mdash;must decide whether to
          increase the current project’s or iteration’s scope to accommodate
          the new requirement. This is a business decision that has
          implications for the project’s schedule and budget and might demand
          trade-offs with other capabilities. An effective change process that
          includes impact analysis ensures that the right people make informed
          business decisions about which changes to accept and that the
          associated costs in time, resources, or feature trade-offs are
          addressed.</p></div><div class="book" title="Product vs. project requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2605">Product vs. project requirements</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1718" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1753" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2154" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2346" class="calibre"></a>So far we have been discussing requirements that

          is a shared responsibility of the BA and the project manager. They

              strategies also are possible. The usage-centric strategy
              emphasizes understanding and exploring user goals to derive the
              necessary system functionality. The product-centric approach
              focuses on defining features that you expect will lead to
              marketplace or business success. A risk with product-centric
              strategies is that you might implement features that don’t get
              used much, even if they seemed like a good idea at the time. We
              recommend understanding business objectives and user goals

          machines, and to other software systems. No other part of the work

        rely on it. The time spent understanding their needs is a
        high-leverage investment in project success. If a project team does
        not have written representations of requirements that the stakeholders
        agree to, how can developers be sure to satisfy those
        stakeholders?</p><p class="calibre3">Often, it’s impossible&mdash;or unnecessary&mdash;to fully specify the
        functional requirements before commencing design and implementation.
        In those cases, you can take an iterative or incremental approach,
        implementing one portion of the requirements at a time and obtaining
        customer feedback before moving on to the next cycle. This is the
        essence of agile development, learning just enough about requirements
        to do thoughtful prioritization and release planning so the team can
        begin delivering valuable software as quickly as possible. This isn’t
        an excuse to write code before contemplating requirements for that
        next increment, though. Iterating on code is more expensive than
        iterating on concepts.</p><p class="calibre3">People sometimes balk at spending the time that it takes to
        write software requirements. But writing the requirements isn’t the
        hard part. The hard part is <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">determining</em></span> the
        requirements. Writing requirements is a matter of clarifying,
        elaborating, and recording what you’ve learned. A solid understanding
        of a product’s requirements ensures that your team works on the right
        problem and devises the best solution to that problem. Without knowing
        the requirements, you can’t tell when the project is done, determine
        whether it has met its goals, or make trade-off decisions when scope
        adjustments are necessary. Instead of balking at spending time on
        requirements, people should instead balk at the money wasted when the
        project doesn’t pay enough attention to requirements.</p></div><div class="book" title="When bad requirements happen to good people"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2620">When bad requirements happen to good people</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The major consequence of requirements problems is rework&mdash;doing
        again something that you thought was already done&mdash;late in development
        or after release. Rework often consumes 30 to 50 percent of your total
        development cost (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-48">[ref219]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-49">[ref079]</a>), and requirements errors can account for 70 to 85
        percent of the rework cost (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-50">[ref156]</a>). Some rework
        does add value and improves the product, but excessive rework is
        wasteful and frustrating. Imagine how different your life would be if
        you could cut the rework effort in half! Your team members could build
        better products faster and perhaps even go home on time. Creating
        better requirements is an investment, not just a cost.</p><p class="calibre3">It can cost far more to correct a defect that’s found late in
        the project than to fix it shortly after its creation. Suppose it
        costs $1 (on a relative scale) to find and fix a requirement defect
        while you’re still working on the requirements. If you discover that
        error during design instead, you have to pay the $1 to fix the
        requirement error, plus another $2 or $3 to redo the design that was
        based on the incorrect requirement. Suppose, though, that no one finds
        the error until a user calls with a problem. Depending on the type of
        system, the cost to correct a requirement defect found in operation
        can be $100 or more on this relative scale (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-51">[ref019]</a>;
        <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-52">[ref096]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-53">[ref105]</a>). One of my
        consulting clients determined that they spent an average of $200 of
        labor effort to find and fix a defect in their information systems
        using the quality technique of software inspection, a type of peer
        review (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-54">[ref245]</a>). In contrast, they spent an average
        of <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">$4,200</em></span> to fix a single defect reported by the
        user, an amplification factor of 21. Preventing requirements errors
        and catching them early clearly has a huge leveraging effect on
        reducing rework.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1774" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2076" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2099" class="calibre"></a>Shortcomings in requirements practices pose many risks

        expectations at the agreed-upon cost and schedule. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 32. Software requirements and risk management" href="#calibre_link-16">Chapter&nbsp;32</a> describes how to
        manage such risks to prevent them from derailing your project. Some of
        the most common requirements risks are described in the following
        sections.</p><div class="book" title="Insufficient user involvement"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2621">Insufficient user involvement</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Customers often don’t understand why it is so essential to
          work hard on eliciting requirements and assuring their quality.
          Developers might not emphasize user involvement, perhaps because
          they think they already understand what the users need. In some
          cases it’s difficult to gain access to people who will actually use
          the product, and user surrogates don’t always understand what users
          really need. Insufficient user involvement leads to late-breaking
          requirements that generate rework and delay completion.</p><p class="calibre3">Another risk of insufficient user involvement, particularly
          when reviewing and validating the requirements, is that the business
          analyst might not understand and properly record the true business
          or customer needs. Sometimes a BA goes down the path of specifying
          what appears to be the “perfect” requirements, and developers
          implement them, but then no one uses the solution because the
          business problem was misunderstood. Ongoing conversations with users
          can help mitigate this risk, but if users don’t review the
          requirements carefully enough, you can still have problems.</p></div><div class="book" title="Inaccurate planning"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2622">Inaccurate planning</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">“Here’s my idea for a new product; when will you be done?” No
          one should answer this question until more is known about the
          problem being discussed. Vague, poorly understood requirements lead
          to overly optimistic estimates, which come back to haunt you when
          the inevitable overruns occur. An estimator’s quick guess sounds a
          lot like a commitment to the listener. The top contributors to poor
          software cost estimation are frequent requirements changes, missing
          requirements, insufficient communication with users, poor
          specification of requirements, and insufficient requirements
          analysis (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-55">[ref055]</a>). Estimating project effort and
          duration based on requirements means that you need to know something
          about the size of your requirements and the development team’s
          productivity. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 5. Establishing the business requirements" href="#calibre_link-32">Chapter&nbsp;5</a> of

          exceed their planned schedules and budgets (which are nearly always
          too optimistic anyway). To manage scope creep, begin with a clear
          statement of the project’s business objectives, strategic vision,
          scope, limitations, and success criteria. Evaluate all proposed new
          features or requirements changes against this reference.
          Requirements <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">will</em></span> change and grow. The project
          manager should build contingency buffers into schedules so the first
          new requirement that comes along doesn’t derail the schedule (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-57">[ref248]</a>). Agile projects take the approach of adjusting
          the scope for a certain iteration to fit into a defined budget and
          duration for the iteration. As new requirements come along, they are
          placed into the backlog of pending work and allocated to future
          iterations based on priority. Change might be critical to success,
          but change always has a price.</p></div><div class="book" title="Ambiguous requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2624">Ambiguous requirements</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1321" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1422" class="calibre"></a>One symptom of ambiguity in requirements is that a
          reader can interpret a requirement statement in several ways (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-58">[ref153]</a>). Another sign is that multiple readers of a
          requirement arrive at different understandings of what it means.
          <a class="xref" title="Chapter 11. Writing excellent requirements" href="#calibre_link-59">Chapter&nbsp;11</a> lists many words
          and phrases that contribute to ambiguity by placing the burden of
          interpretation on the reader.</p><p class="calibre3">Ambiguity leads to different expectations on the part of
          various stakeholders. Some of them are then surprised at whatever is
          delivered. Ambiguous requirements cause wasted time when developers
          implement a solution for the wrong problem. Testers who expect the
          product to behave differently from what the developers built waste
          time resolving the differences.</p><p class="calibre3">One way to ferret out ambiguity is to have people who
          represent different perspectives inspect the requirements (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-54">[ref245]</a>). As described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 17. Validating the requirements" href="#calibre_link-60">Chapter&nbsp;17</a> informal peer reviews in
          which reviewers simply read the requirements on their own often
          don’t reveal ambiguities. If different reviewers interpret a
          requirement in different ways but it makes sense to each of them,
          they won’t find the ambiguity. Collaborative elicitation and
          validation encourages stakeholders to discuss and clarify
          requirements as a group in a workshop setting. Writing tests against
          the requirements and building prototypes are other ways to discover
          ambiguities.</p></div><div class="book" title="Gold plating"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2625">Gold plating</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Gold plating</em></span> takes place when a developer
          adds functionality that wasn’t in the requirements specification (or
          was deemed out of scope) but which the developer believes “the users
          are just going to love.” If users don’t care about this
          functionality, the time spent implementing it is wasted. Rather than
          simply inserting new features, developers and BAs should present
          stakeholders with creative ideas for their consideration. Developers
          should strive for leanness and simplicity, not going beyond what
          stakeholders request without their approval.</p><p class="calibre3">Customers sometimes request certain features or elaborate user
          interfaces that look attractive but add little value to the product.
          Everything you build costs time and money, so you need to maximize
          the delivered value. To reduce the threat of gold plating, trace
          each bit of functionality back to its origin and its business
          justification so everyone knows why it’s included. Make sure that
          what you are specifying and developing lies within the project’s
          scope.</p></div><div class="book" title="Overlooked stakeholders"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2626">Overlooked stakeholders</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2183" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2347" class="calibre"></a>Most products have several groups of users who might
          use different subsets of features, have different frequencies of
          use, or have varying levels of experience. If you don’t identify the
          important user classes for your product early on, some user needs
          won’t be met. After identifying all user classes, make sure that
          each has a voice, as discussed in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 6. Finding the voice of the user" href="#calibre_link-61">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>. Besides obvious users,
          think about maintenance and field support staff who have their own
          requirements, both functional and nonfunctional. People who have to
          convert data from a legacy system will have transition requirements
          that don’t affect the ultimate product software but that certainly
          influence solution success. You might have stakeholders who don’t
          even know the project exists, such as government agencies that
          mandate standards that affect your system, yet you need to know
          about them and their influence on the project.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Benefits from a high-quality requirements process"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2627">Benefits from a high-quality requirements process</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Some people mistakenly believe that time spent discussing
        requirements simply delays delivery by the same duration. This assumes
        that there’s no return on investment from requirements activities. In
        actuality, investing in good requirements will virtually always return
        more than it costs.</p><p class="calibre3">Sound requirements processes emphasize a collaborative approach
        to product development that involves stakeholders in a partnership
        throughout the project. Eliciting requirements lets the development
        team better understand its user community or market, a critical
        success factor. Emphasizing user tasks instead of superficially
        attractive features helps the team avoid writing code that no one will
        ever execute. Customer involvement reduces the expectation gap between
        what the customer really needs and what the developer delivers. You’re
        going to get the customer input eventually; it’s far cheaper to reach
        this understanding before you build the product than after delivery.
        <a class="xref" title="Chapter 2. Requirements from the customer’s perspective" href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter&nbsp;2</a> addresses
        the nature of the customer-development partnership.</p><p class="calibre3">Explicitly allocating system requirements to various software,
        hardware, and human subsystems emphasizes a systems approach to
        product engineering. An effective change control process will minimize
        the adverse impact of requirements changes. Documented and clear
        requirements greatly facilitate system testing. All of these increase
        your chances of delivering high-quality products that satisfy all
        stakeholders.</p><p class="calibre3">No one can promise a specific return on investment from using
        sound requirements practices. You can go through an analytical thought
        process to imagine how better requirements could help your teams,
        though (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>). The cost of better requirements
        includes developing new procedures and document templates, training
        the team, and buying tools. Your greatest investment is the time your
        project teams actually spend on requirements engineering tasks. The

      Gerhard began. “The system should keep track of all the chemical
      containers we already have in the stockroom and in laboratories. That
      way, the chemists can get some chemicals from someone down the hall
      instead of always buying a new container. This should save us a lot of
      money. Also, the Health and Safety Department needs to generate
      government reports on chemical usage and disposal with a lot less work
      than it takes them today. Can you build this system in time for the
      compliance audit in five months?”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“I see why this project is important, Gerhard,” said
      Cynthia. “But before I can commit to a schedule, we’ll need to
      understand the requirements for the chemical tracking
      system.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Gerhard was confused. “What do you mean? I just told you
      my requirements.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“Actually, you described some general business
      objectives for the project,” Cynthia explained. “That doesn’t give me
      enough information to know what software to build or how long it might
      take. I’d like to have one of our business analysts work with some users
      to understand their needs for the system.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“The chemists are busy people,” Gerhard protested. “They
      don’t have time to nail down every detail before you can start
      programming. Can’t your people figure out what to
      build?”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Cynthia replied, “If we just make our best guess at what
      the users need to do with the system, we can’t do a good job. We’re
      software developers, not chemists. I’ve learned that if we don’t take
      the time to understand the problem, nobody is happy with the
      results.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“We don’t have time for all that,” Gerhard insisted. “I

      posted on your progress.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">Conversations like this take place regularly in the software
      world. Customers who request a new system often don’t understand the
      importance of obtaining input from actual users of the proposed system
      as well as other stakeholders. Marketers with a great product concept
      believe that they can adequately represent the interests of prospective
      buyers. However, there’s no substitute for eliciting requirements
      directly from people who will actually use the product. Some agile
      development methods recommend that an on-site customer representative,
      sometimes called a product owner, work closely with the development
      team. As one book about agile development said, “The project is
      <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">steered</em></span> to success by the customer and programmers
      working in concert” (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-65">[ref128]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-688" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-929" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1191" class="calibre"></a>Part of the requirements problem results from confusion
      over the different levels of requirements described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 1. The essential software requirement" href="#calibre_link-21">Chapter&nbsp;1</a>: business, user, and
      functional. Gerhard stated some business objectives, benefits that he
      expects Contoso to enjoy with the help of the new chemical tracking
      system. Business objectives are a core element of the business
      requirements. However, Gerhard can’t entirely describe the user
      requirements because he’s not an intended user of the system. Users, in
      turn, can describe tasks they must be able to perform with the system,
      but they can’t state all the functional requirements that developers
      must implement to let them accomplish those tasks. Business analysts
      need to collaborate with users to reach that deeper
      understanding.</p><p class="calibre3">This chapter addresses the customer-development relationship that
      is so critical to software project success. We propose a Requirements
      Bill of Rights for Software Customers and a corresponding Requirements
      Bill of Responsibilities for Software Customers. These lists underscore
      the importance of customer&mdash;and specifically end user&mdash;involvement in
      requirements development. This chapter also discusses the critical issue
      of reaching agreement on a set of requirements planned for a specific
      release or development iteration. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 6. Finding the voice of the user" href="#calibre_link-61">Chapter&nbsp;6</a> describes various types of

        once. The developers had recently built a new information system for
        use within the company. They had obtained negligible user input from
        the beginning. The day the developers proudly unveiled their new
        system, the users rejected it as completely unacceptable. This came as
        a shock because the developers had worked hard to satisfy what they
        perceived to be the users’ needs. So what did they do then? They fixed
        it. Companies always fix the system when they get the requirements
        wrong, yet it always costs much more than if they had engaged user
        representatives from the outset.</p><p class="calibre3">The developers hadn’t planned to spend time fixing the flawed
        information system, of course, so the next project in the team’s queue
        had to wait. This is a lose-lose-lose situation. The developers were
        chagrined, the users were unhappy because their new system wasn’t
        available when they expected it, and the executives were upset over a
        lot of wasted money and the opportunity costs of delaying other
        projects. Extensive and ongoing customer engagement from the start
        could have prevented this unfortunate&mdash;but not uncommon&mdash;project
        outcome.</p></div><div class="book" title="The expectation gap"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2631">The expectation gap</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Without adequate customer involvement, the inescapable outcome
        at the end of the project is an expectation gap, a gulf between what
        customers really need and what developers deliver based on what they
        heard at the beginning of the project (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-66">[ref240]</a>).
        This is shown as the dashed lines in <a class="xref" title="Figure 2-1. Frequent customer engagement reduces the expectation gap." href="#calibre_link-67">Figure&nbsp;2-1</a>. As with the
        previous story, the expectation gap comes as a rude surprise to all
        stakeholders. In our experience, software surprises are never good
        news. Requirements also get out of date because of changes that occur
        in the business, so ongoing interactions with customers are
        vital.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-67" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2632" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000006.jpeg" alt="A graph that shows time across the x-axis, and the               expectation gap between what the customer needs and what the               developer builds on the y-axis.

        arrange frequent contact points with suitable customer
        representatives. These contact points can take the form of interviews,
        conversations, requirements reviews, user interface design
        walkthroughs, prototype evaluations, and&mdash;with agile development&mdash;user
        feedback on small increments of executable software. Each contact
        point affords an opportunity to close the expectation gap: what the
        developer builds is more closely aligned with what the customer
        needs.</p><p class="calibre3">Of course, the gap will begin to grow again immediately as
        development proceeds after each contact. The more frequent the contact
        points are, the easier it is to stay on track. As the progressively
        shrinking small gray triangles in <a class="xref" title="Figure 2-1. Frequent customer engagement reduces the expectation gap." href="#calibre_link-67">Figure&nbsp;2-1</a> illustrate, a
        series of such contact points will lead to a far smaller expectation
        gap at the end of the project and a solution that is much closer to
        the actual customer needs. This is why one of the guiding principles
        of agile development is to have ongoing conversations between
        developers and customers. That’s an excellent principle for any
        project.</p></div><div class="book" title="Who is the customer?"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2633">Who is the customer?</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Before we can talk about customers, we need to discuss

        <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-44">[ref115]</a>). When searching for potential stakeholders
        for a particular project, cast a wide net to avoid overlooking some
        important community. Then you can focus this candidate stakeholder
        list down to the core set whose input you really need, to make sure
        you understand all of the project’s requirements and constraints so
        your team can deliver the right solution.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2182" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2451" class="calibre"></a>Customers are a subset of stakeholders. A
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">customer</em></span> is an individual or organization that
        derives either direct or indirect benefit from a product. Software
        customers could request, pay for, select, specify, use, or receive the
        output generated by a software product. The customers shown in <a class="xref" title="Figure 2-2. Potential stakeholders within the project team, within the developing organization, and outside the organization." href="#calibre_link-68">Figure&nbsp;2-2</a> include the
        direct user, indirect user, executive sponsor, procurement staff, and
        acquirer. Some stakeholders are not customers, such as legal staff,
        compliance auditors, suppliers, contractors, and venture capitalists.
        Gerhard, the manager we met earlier, represents an executive sponsor
        who is paying for the project. Customers like Gerhard provide the
        business requirements, which establish the guiding framework for the
        project and the business rationale for launching it. As discussed in
        <a class="xref" title="Chapter 5. Establishing the business requirements" href="#calibre_link-32">Chapter&nbsp;5</a> business
        requirements describe the business objectives that the customer,
        company, or other stakeholders want to achieve. All other product
        requirements need to align with achieving those desired business
        outcomes.</p><p class="calibre3">User requirements should come from people who will actually use
        the product, either directly or indirectly. These users (often called
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">end users</em></span>) are a subset of customers. Direct
        users will operate the product hands-on. Indirect users might receive
        outputs from the system without touching it themselves, such as a
        warehouse manager who receives an automatic report of daily warehouse
        activities by email. Users can describe the tasks they need to perform
        with the product, the outputs they need, and the quality
        characteristics they expect the product to exhibit.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2635" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">The case of the missing stakeholder</div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-831" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2176" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2177" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2476" class="calibre"></a>I know of a project that was almost finished with
          requirements elicitation when, while reviewing a process flow, the
          business analyst (BA) asked the stakeholder, “Are you sure we have
          the tax calculation steps correct in this flow?” The stakeholder
          replied, “Oh, I don’t know. I don’t own tax. That’s the tax
          department.” The team hadn’t talked to anyone in the tax department
          over the course of working on the project for months. They had no
          idea that there even <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">was</em></span> a tax department. As
          soon as the BAs did meet with the tax department, they found a long
          list of missed requirements around the legal implications of how
          tax-related functions were implemented. The project was delayed
          several months as a result. Using an organization chart to search
          for all stakeholders who will be affected by a new system can avoid
          such unpleasantness.</p></div><p class="calibre3">Customers who provide the business requirements sometimes
        purport to speak for the actual users. They are often too far removed
        from the work to provide accurate user requirements, though. For
        corporate information systems, contract development, or custom
        application development, business requirements should come from the
        person who is ultimately accountable for the business value expected
        from the product. User requirements should come from people who will
        press the keys, touch the screen, or receive the outputs. If there is
        a serious disconnect between the acquiring customers who are paying
        for the project and the end users, major problems are
        guaranteed.</p><p class="calibre3">The situation is different for commercial software development,
        where the customer and the user often are the same person. Customer
        surrogates, such as marketing personnel or a product manager,
        typically attempt to determine what customers would find appealing.
        Even for commercial software, though, you should strive to engage end
        users in the process of developing user requirements, as <a class="xref" title="Chapter 7. Requirements elicitation" href="#calibre_link-31">Chapter&nbsp;7</a> describes. If you don’t, be
        prepared to read reviews pointing out product shortcomings that
        adequate user input could have avoided.</p><p class="calibre3">Conflicts can arise among project stakeholders. Business
        requirements sometimes reflect organizational strategies or budgetary
        constraints that aren’t apparent to users. Users who are upset about
        having a new information system forced on them by management might not
        want to work with the software developers, viewing them as the
        harbingers of an undesired future. Such folks are sometimes called
        “loser groups” (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-70">[ref082]</a>). To manage such potential
        conflicts, try communication strategies about project objectives and
        constraints that can build buy-in and avoid debates and hard
        feelings.</p></div><div class="book" title="The customer-development partnership"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2636">The customer-development partnership</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">An excellent software product results from a well-executed
        design based on excellent requirements. Excellent requirements result
        from effective collaboration between developers and customers (in

        work only when all parties involved know what they need to be
        successful and when they understand and respect what their
        collaborators need to be successful. As project pressures rise, it’s
        easy to forget that all stakeholders share a common objective: to
        build a product that provides adequate business value and rewards to
        all stakeholders. The business analyst typically is the point person
        who has to forge this collaborative partnership.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-660" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-662" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-841" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-842" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-932" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-934" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1042" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1043" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1929" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1931" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2140" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2142" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2185" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2187" class="calibre"></a>The Requirements Bill of Rights for Software Customers

            your needs. Invite BAs and developers to observe what you and your
            colleagues do on the job. If the new system is replacing an
            existing one, the BAs should use the current system as you use it.
            This will show them how it fits into your workflow and where it
            can be improved. Don’t just assume that the BA will already know
            all about your business operations and terminology (see

            stakeholders provide and ask follow-up questions to distinguish
            user requirements from business rules, functional requirements,
            quality goals, and other items. The ultimate deliverable from this
            analysis is a refined set of requirements stored in some
            appropriate form, such as a software requirements specification
            document or a requirements management tool. This set of
            requirements constitutes the agreement among the stakeholders
            about the functions, qualities, and constraints of the product to
            be built. Requirements should be written and organized in a way
            that you find easy to understand. Your review of these
            specifications and other requirements representations, such as
            visual analysis models, helps to ensure that they accurately

            explain the practices he’s recommending and explain what
            information goes into each deliverable. For instance, the BA might
            create some diagrams to complement textual requirements. These
            diagrams might be unfamiliar to you, and they can be complex, but
            the notations shouldn’t be difficult to understand. The BA should
            explain the purpose of each diagram, what the symbols mean, and
            how to examine the diagram for errors. If the BA doesn’t offer
            such explanations, feel free to ask for them.</p></div><div class="book" title="Right #5: To change your requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2644">Right #5: To change your requirements</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">It’s not realistic for BAs or developers to expect you to

            requirements to remain static throughout the development cycle.
            You have the right to make changes in the requirements as the
            business evolves, as the team gathers more input from
            stakeholders, or as you think more carefully about what you need.
            However, change always has a price. Sometimes adding a new
            function demands trade-offs with other functions or with the
            project’s schedule or budget. An important part of the BA’s
            responsibility is to assess, manage, and communicate change
            impacts. Work with the BA on your project to agree on a simple but
            effective process for handling changes.</p></div><div class="book" title="Right #6: To expect an environment of mutual respect"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2645">Right #6: To expect an environment of mutual

            becomes adversarial. Requirements discussions can be frustrating
            if the participants don’t understand each other. Working together
            can open the eyes of the participants to the problems each group
            faces. Customers who participate in requirements development have
            the right to expect BAs and developers to treat them with respect
            and to appreciate the time they are investing in the project’s
            success. Similarly, customers should demonstrate respect for the
            development team members as everyone collaborates toward their
            mutual objective of a successful project. Everyone’s on the same

            is, you want to avoid “paving the cow paths.” A BA can often

            of existing software components or requirements that come close to
            addressing some need you described. In such a case, the BA should
            suggest ways of modifying your requirements or avoiding
            unnecessary customizations so developers can reuse those
            components. Adjusting your requirements when sensible reuse
            opportunities are available saves time and money. Some
            requirements flexibility is essential if you want to incorporate
            commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) packages into the product, because
            they will rarely have precisely the characteristics you

            Sometimes the BA might think she understands a point you made,
            only to realize later that she needs further clarification. Please
            be patient with this iterative approach to developing and refining
            the requirements; it’s the nature of complex human communication
            and a key to software success. The total time required is less

            because pinning down details is tedious and time consuming (or
            because someone wants to evade being held accountable for his
            decisions). At some point, though, someone must resolve the
            ambiguities and imprecisions. You’re the best person to make those
            decisions. Otherwise, you’re relying on the BA or developers to
            guess correctly. It’s fine to temporarily include <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">to be
            determined</em></span> (TBD) markers in the requirements to
            indicate that additional exploration or information is needed.
            Sometimes, though, TBD is used because a specific requirement is
            difficult to resolve and no one wants to tackle it. Try to clarify
            the intent of each requirement so that the BA can express it
            accurately. This is the best way to ensure that the product will
            meet your needs.</p></div><div class="book" title="Responsibility #4: To make timely decisions about requirements when asked"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2654">Responsibility #4: To make timely decisions about

            home, the BA will ask you to make many decisions. These include
            resolving conflicting requests received from multiple customers,
            choosing between incompatible quality attributes, and evaluating
            the accuracy of information. Customers who are authorized to make
            such decisions must do so promptly when asked. Developers often
            can’t proceed with confidence until you render your decision, so
            time spent waiting for an answer can delay progress. When the
            demands for your time start to feel onerous, remember that the
            system is being built for you. Business analysts are often skilled

            the cost and feasibility of requirements</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">All software functions have a cost. Developers are in the
            best position to estimate those costs. Some features might not be
            technically feasible or might be surprisingly expensive to
            implement. Certain requirements might demand unattainable
            performance in the operating environment or require access to data
            that isn’t available to the system. The developer can be the
            bearer of bad news about feasibility or cost. You should respect
            that judgment, even if it means you might not get something you
            asked for in exactly the form you envisioned. Sometimes, you can
            rewrite requirements in a way that makes them attainable or
            cheaper. For example, asking for an action to take place
            “instantaneously” isn’t feasible, but a more precise timing
            requirement (“within 50 milliseconds”) might be achievable.</p></div><div class="book" title="Responsibility #6: To set realistic requirement priorities in collaboration with developers"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2656">Responsibility #6: To set realistic requirement priorities

            implement every bit of functionality all customers want.
            Determining which capabilities are essential, which are useful,
            and which the customers can live without is an important part of
            requirements analysis. You have a lead role in setting requirement
            priorities. Developers can provide information about the cost and
            risk of each requirement or user story to help determine final
            priorities. When you establish realistic priorities, you help the
            developers deliver the maximum value at the lowest cost and at the
            right time. Collaborative prioritization is key for agile
            projects, so the developers can begin delivering useful software
            as quickly as possible.</p><p class="calibre3">Respect the development team’s judgment as to how much of
            the requested functionality they can complete within the available
            time and resource constraints. If everything you want doesn’t fit
            in the project box, the decision makers will have to reduce
            project scope based on priorities, extend the schedule, or provide
            additional funds or people. Simply declaring every requirement as
            high priority is neither realistic nor collaborative.</p></div><div class="book" title="Responsibility #7: To review requirements and evaluate prototypes"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2657">Responsibility #7: To review requirements and evaluate

            requirements are among the most powerful software quality
            activities available. Having customers participate in reviews is a
            key way to evaluate whether the requirements demonstrate the
            desired characteristics of being complete, correct, and necessary.
            A review is also an opportunity for customer representatives to
            assess how well the BA’s work is meeting the project’s needs. Busy
            customers often are reluctant to devote time to a requirements
            review, but it’s well worth their time. The BA should make
            requirements available to you for review in manageable chunks
            throughout the requirements elicitation process, not in a massive
            tome dumped on your desk when the requirements are “done.”</p><p class="calibre3">It’s hard to develop a good mental picture of how software
            will work from written requirements alone. To better understand
            your needs and explore the best ways to satisfy them, BAs or
            developers sometimes build prototypes of the intended product.
            Your feedback on these preliminary, partial, or exploratory

How can they tell
            if the software they built will meet the expectations of the
            various customer communities? As a customer, one of your
            responsibilities is to establish acceptance criteria, predefined
            conditions that the product must satisfy to be judged acceptable.
            Such criteria include acceptance tests, which assess whether the
            product lets users perform certain of their important business
            operations correctly. Other acceptance criteria might address the
            estimated remaining defect levels, the performance of certain
            actions in the operating environment, or the ability to satisfy
            external certification requirements. Agile projects rely heavily
            on acceptance tests, instead of written requirements, to flesh out
            the details of user stories. Testers can judge whether a specified
            requirement was implemented correctly, but they don’t always know

            impact. Notify the BA as soon as you learn that you need to change
            a requirement. To minimize the negative impact of changes, follow
            the project’s defined change control process. This ensures that
            requested changes are not lost, the impact of each change is
            analyzed, and all proposed changes are considered in a consistent

            excellent investment. The process will be less painful if you
            respect the techniques the BAs use. Feel free to ask BAs to
            explain why they’re requesting certain information or asking you
            to participate in some requirements-related activity. A mutual
            understanding of, and respect for, each other’s approaches and
            needs goes a long way toward establishing an effective&mdash;perhaps
            even enjoyable&mdash;collaboration.</p></div></div></div><div class="book" title="Creating a culture that respects requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2661">Creating a culture that respects requirements</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The leader of a corporate requirements organization once posed a
        problem: “I’m experiencing issues in gaining agreement from some of
        our developers to participate in requirements development,” she said.
        “How can I help them understand the value of their participation?” In
        another organization, a BA experienced a clash between developers
        seeking detailed input for an accounting system and an IT manager who
        simply wanted to brainstorm requirements without using any specific
        elicitation techniques. “Do readers of your book risk cultural
        conflict?” this BA asked me.</p><p class="calibre3">These questions exemplify the challenges that can arise when
        trying to engage BAs, developers, and customers in a collaborative
        requirements partnership. You’d think it would be obvious to a user
        that providing requirements input makes it more likely that he’ll get
        what he needs. Developers ought to recognize that participating in the
        process will make their lives easier than being hit on the head by
        whatever requirements document flies over the proverbial wall.
        Obviously, not everyone is as excited about requirements as you are;
        if they were, they’d probably all become business analysts!</p><p class="calibre3">Culture clashes frequently arise when teams are working on
        requirements. There are those who recognize the many risks associated
        with trying to develop software based on minimal or telepathically
        communicated requirements. Then there are those who think requirements
        are unnecessary. It can be tough to gain business-side cooperation on
        projects like legacy-system replacement if users see this as unrelated
        to their own business problems and not worth their time. Understanding
        why people resist participating in requirements development is the
        first step to being able to address it.</p><p class="calibre3">It’s possible that the resisters haven’t been exposed to solid
        requirements practices. Or they might have suffered from poor
        implementation of requirements processes, perhaps working on a project
        that produced a large, incomplete, and ignored requirements
        specification. That would leave a bad taste in anyone’s mouth. Perhaps
        the resisters don’t understand and appreciate the value of those
        practices when performed effectively. They might not realize the price
        they have paid for having worked in a casual and unstructured
        environment in the past. That price mostly shows up as unexpected
        rework that leads to late deliveries and poor software. Such rework is
        buried in the daily activities of the project participants, so they
        don’t recognize it as a serious inefficiency.</p><p class="calibre3">If you’re trying to get developers, managers, and customers on
        board, make sure everyone understands the past pain the organization
        and its customers have experienced because of requirements problems.
        Find specific examples to demonstrate the impact in case individuals
        haven’t felt the pain themselves. Express the cost in units that are
        meaningful to the organization, be it dollars, time, customer
        dissatisfaction, or lost business opportunities. Development managers
        aren’t always aware of how badly requirements shortcomings hurt their
        teams’ productivity. So show them how poor requirements slow down
        design and lead to excessive&mdash;and expensive&mdash;course corrections.</p><p class="calibre3">Developers are stakeholders in the project, but sometimes their
        input isn’t solicited and they become the “victims” of the
        requirements that are thrust upon them. Therefore, they benefit from
        providing input that will make the requirements documentation as
        useful and meaningful as possible. I like to have developers review
        requirements as they are evolving. That way they know what’s coming
        and can spot areas that need more clarity. You also need developer
        input when specifying internal quality attributes that aren’t visible
        to users. Developers can offer suggestions no one else might have
        thought about: easier ways to do certain things; functionality that
        would be very time-consuming to implement; unnecessary imposed design
        constraints; missing requirements, such as how exceptions should be
        handled; and creative opportunities to take advantage of
        technologies.</p><p class="calibre3">Quality assurance staff and testers are also valuable
        contributors to excellent requirements. Instead of waiting until later
        in the project, engage these sharp-eyed people in the iterative review
        of requirements early on. They’re likely to find many ambiguities,
        conflicts, and concerns with the requirements as they are developing
        their test cases and scenarios from the requirements. Testers can also
        provide input on specifying verifiable quality attribute
        requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">Resistance to process or culture change can indicate fear,
        uncertainty, or lack of knowledge. If you can discern the source of
        the resistance, you can confront it with reassurance, clarification,
        and education. Show people how their participation not only is in
        their personal best interest but also will lead to collectively better
        results.</p><p class="calibre3">The organization’s leadership must understand the need for the
        organization to have effective business analysis and requirements
        engineering capabilities as strategic core competencies. Though
        project-specific and localized grassroots efforts are important,
        without management commitment, the improvements and benefits likely
        won’t be sustained after the project ends or following a
        reorganization.</p></div><div class="book" title="Identifying decision makers"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2662">Identifying decision makers</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-599" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-676" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-682" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-856" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-926" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-930" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-978" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-979" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1731" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2179" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2184" class="calibre"></a>There can be hundreds of decisions to make on software
        projects; often, they are on the critical path to being able to move
        ahead. You might need to resolve some conflict, accept (or reject) a
        proposed change, or approve a set of requirements for a specific
        release. Early in your project, determine who the requirements
        decision makers will be and how they will make decisions. My friend
        Chris, a seasoned project manager, pointed out, “I have found that
        there is usually one primary decision maker on a project, oftentimes
        the key sponsor within the organization. I don’t rest until I have
        identified that person, and then I make sure he is always aware of the
        project’s progress.” There’s no single correct answer as to who should
        make key decisions. A small group representing key areas&mdash;such as
        management, customers, business analysis, development, and
        marketing&mdash;generally works best. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 28. Change happens" href="#calibre_link-72">Chapter&nbsp;28</a>

        requirements-related decisions on each of your projects should choose
        a decision rule before they confront their first significant

        built, or for a specific portion of it, is at the core of the
        customer-developer partnership. Multiple parties are involved in this
        agreement:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Customers agree that the requirements address their
            needs.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Developers agree that they understand the requirements and
            that they are feasible.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Testers agree that the requirements are verifiable.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Management agrees that the requirements will achieve their
            business objectives.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-644" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2120" class="calibre"></a>Many organizations use the act of “signing off” (why not
        “signing on”?) on the requirements as the mark of stakeholder
        approval. All participants in the requirements approval process should
        know exactly what sign-off means or problems could ensue. One such
        problem is the customer representative or manager who regards signing
        off on the requirements as a meaningless ritual: “I was handed a piece
        of paper with my name on it, so I signed on the line above my name
        because otherwise the developers wouldn’t start coding.” This can lead
        to future problems when that individual wants to change the
        requirements or when he’s surprised by what is delivered: “Sure, I
        signed off on the requirements, but I didn’t have time to read them
        all. I trusted you guys&mdash;you let me down!”</p><p class="calibre3">Equally problematic is the development manager who views
        sign-off as a way to freeze the requirements. Whenever a change
        request comes along he can protest, “But you signed off on these
        requirements, so that’s what we’re building. If you wanted something
        else, you should have said so.”</p><p class="calibre3">Both of these attitudes ignore the reality that it’s impossible
        to know all the requirements early in the project and that
        requirements will undoubtedly change over time. Approving a set of
        requirements is an appropriate action that brings closure to some
        stage of requirements development. However, the participants have to
        agree on precisely what they’re saying with their signatures.</p><div class="note" title="Important"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-2664" class="calibre"></a>Important</h3><p class="calibre3">Don’t use sign-off as a weapon. Treat it as a milestone, with
          a clear, shared understanding of the activities that lead to
          sign-off and its implications for future changes. If the decision
          makers don’t need to read every word of the requirements, select a
          communication technique&mdash;such as a slide presentation&mdash;that summarizes
          the essential elements and facilitates reaching agreement
          quickly.</p></div><div class="book" title="The requirements baseline"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2665">The requirements baseline</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">More important than the sign-off ritual is the concept of
          establishing a <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">baseline</em></span> of the requirements
          agreement, a snapshot of it at a point in time (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>). A requirements baseline is a set of
          requirements that has been reviewed and agreed upon and serves as
          the basis for further development. Whether your team uses a formal
          sign-off process or some other means of reaching agreement on
          requirements, the subtext of that agreement should read something
          like this:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“I agree that this set of requirements represents
            our best understanding of the requirements for the next portion of
            this project and that the solution described will meet our needs
            as we understand them today. I agree to make future changes in
            this baseline through the project’s defined change process. I
            realize that changes might require us to renegotiate cost,
            resource, and schedule commitments.”</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">Some organizations put text like this right on the signature
          page, so the requirement approvers know exactly what sign-off means
          in their world.</p><p class="calibre3">A shared understanding along these lines helps reduce the
          friction that can arise as requirements oversights are revealed or
          marketplace and business demands evolve over the course of the
          project. A meaningful baselining process gives all the major
          stakeholders confidence in the following ways:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Customer management or marketing is confident that the
              project scope won’t explode out of control, because customers
              manage the scope change decisions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">User representatives have confidence that the development
              team will work with them to deliver the right solution, even if
              they didn’t think of every requirement before construction
              began.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Development management has confidence because the
              development team has a business partner who will keep the
              project focused on achieving its objectives and will work with
              development to balance schedule, cost, functionality, and
              quality.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Business analysts and project managers are confident that
              they can manage changes to the project in a way that will keep
              chaos to a minimum.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Quality assurance and test teams can confidently develop
              their test scripts and be fully prepared for their project
              activities.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">After the decision makers define a baseline, the BA should
          place the requirements under change control. This allows the team to
          modify scope when necessary in a controlled way that includes
          analyzing the impact of each proposed change on the schedule and
          other success factors. Sealing the initial requirements development
          activities with an explicit agreement helps forge a collaborative
          customer-development partnership on the way to project
          success.</p></div><div class="book" title="What if you don’t reach agreement?"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2666">What if you don’t reach agreement?</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">It can be hard to achieve sign-off from all the relevant
          stakeholders. Barriers include logistics, busy schedules, and people
          who are reluctant to commit and be held accountable later. If
          stakeholders are afraid they won’t be able to make changes after
          they approve the requirements, they might drag their feet on the
          approval. This contributes to the dreaded trap of analysis
          paralysis. Many teams have tried sending out an email message that
          says, “If you don’t reply by next Friday with your changes and/or
          sign-off, I’m going to assume you are agreeing to these
          requirements.” That’s one option, but really it equates to
          <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">not</em></span> reaching agreement. It also risks straining
          the relationship with those stakeholders for whom you’ve just
          assumed a tacit approval. Try to understand why they didn’t feel
          comfortable with a sign-off and address that directly.</p><p class="calibre3">In such a situation, you’re better off moving
          forward&mdash;cautiously&mdash;with the assumption that you don’t have approval
          from the recalcitrant stakeholders. Document the fact that certain
          stakeholders didn’t sign off on the requirements in your risk list,
          along with the likely impact of some of the requirements being
          missing or wrong. Follow up with these people as part of risk
          management. In a positive manner, mention that you recognize that
          they have not yet approved the requirements but that the project is
          still moving forward with those requirements as a baseline so as to
          not impede progress. Let them know that, if they want to change
          things, there’s a process in place to do that. Basically, you’re
          acting as though the stakeholder did indeed agree to the
          requirements, but you’re managing the communications closely.</p></div><div class="book" title="Agreeing on requirements on agile projects"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2667">Agreeing on requirements on agile projects</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-591" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-668" class="calibre"></a>Agile projects do not include a formal sign-off
          action. Agile projects generally maintain requirements in the form
          of user stories in a product backlog. The product owner and the team
          reach agreement on what stories will be developed in the next
          iteration in a planning session. The set of stories is chosen based
          on their priority and the team’s velocity (productivity). After that
          set has been established and agreed to, the stories contained in the
          iteration are frozen. Requested changes that come in are considered
          for future iterations. There’s no attempt on an agile project to
          achieve stakeholder approval on the full scope of requirements for
          the project up front, however. In agile projects the full set of
          functionality is identified over time, although the vision and other
          business requirements do need to be established at the outset. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 20. Agile projects" href="#calibre_link-25">Chapter&nbsp;20</a> discusses how requirements are handled
          on agile projects.</p><p class="calibre3">I once worked with a client who requested sign-off on
          requirements even though they were following an agile development
          life cycle. The team had to be creative with how to do this in a
          context that doesn’t traditionally involve sign-offs. The BA team
          had worked closely with the users to elicit and review requirements
          in the form of user stories and other models such as process flows
          and state tables. We asked the users to “sign off” that, at that
          moment in time, there were no major requirements missing
          <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">that they knew about</em></span>, and there were no major
          issues with what we’d written down <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">that they knew
          about</em></span>. Because users did participate in the requirements
          activities, development would not be working on a solution that
          would be far off base. But this notion of “sign-off” also keeps open
          the right of the users to realize later on that they need something
          new or got something wrong.</p><p class="calibre3">In contrast to the historical notion of sign-off as meaning
          “approve and freeze all the requirements up front,” this approach
          doesn’t force anyone into a corner where he feels like he’s signing
          away his life over a massive requirements document that he barely
          understands. Nor are customers forced to agree that the requirements
          are close to perfect and that everything was addressed the first
          time around. This version of sign-off allows the spirit of agile
          methods to prevail. As with the sign-off process described earlier,
          the essence is to reach agreement on a specific body of
          requirements&mdash;a baseline&mdash;to be implemented in the next construction
          cycle, with a clear, shared understanding of what that agreement
          really means.</p><p class="calibre3">Commonly on agile projects, the product owner publicly accepts
          or rejects the requirements for an iteration, which consist of a set
          of stories and their accompanying acceptance criteria and acceptance
          tests. The ultimate “sign-off” is acceptance of the working, tested
          software delivered from the iteration.</p><p class="calibre3">As consultant Nanette Brown put it, “Even in an agile
          environment the concept of sign-off can fill a valid function. Agile
          tells us to ‘embrace change,’ but the concept of change only exists
          with respect to a reference point. Even within a team where there is
          close communication, people can have different interpretations of
          current plans and status. One person’s ‘change’ can be what another
          person thought was already agreed to. However, if you position a
          sign-off as a lightweight ceremony acknowledging that ‘We are Here’
          I think it’s fine. Just because ‘We are Here’ today doesn’t mean we
          can’t be somewhere else tomorrow, but at least it ensures a common
          understanding and point of reference.”</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2668" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Next steps</div><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Identify the customers, including end users, who are

                the risk in terms of number of late requirements changes, time
                spent fixing the product after delivery, or business
                opportunities missed. Use that experience in the future as a
                story to learn from and to convince others of why customer

      manager, Kristin. “We’re looking forward to having you help us with the
      requirements for this project. I understand that you were a business
      analyst in your previous job. Do you have some idea of how we should get
      started here?”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“Well,” Sarah replied, “I was thinking I should just
      interview some users and see what they want. Then I’ll write up what
      they tell me. That should give the developers a good place to start.
      That’s mostly what we did before. Do you know some users I could talk
      to?”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“Hmmm. Do you think that will be good enough for this
      type of project?” Kristin asked. “We tried that approach before, but it
      didn’t work out very well. I was hoping you might have some ideas about
      best practices from your past BA experiences that might be better than
      just interviewing a couple of users. Are there any particular techniques
      that you’ve found to be especially helpful?”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Sarah was rather at a loss. “I don’t really know about
      any specific ways to approach requirements other than talking to users
      and trying to write clear specifications from what they say. At my last
      job I just did the best I could based on my business experience. Let me
      see what I can find out.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">Every software professional needs to acquire a tool kit of
      techniques she can use to approach each project challenge. A
      practitioner who lacks such a tool kit is forced to invent an approach
      based on whatever seems reasonable at the moment. Such ad hoc methods
      rarely yield great results. Some people advocate for specific software
      development methodologies, packaged sets of techniques that purport to
      provide holistic solutions to your project challenges. However, simply
      following a script&mdash;a standard process that’s supposed to work in every
      situation&mdash;doesn’t work very well, either. We find it more effective to
      identify and apply industry best practices. The best-practice approach
      stocks your software tool kit with a variety of techniques you can apply
      to diverse problems.</p><p class="calibre3">The notion of best practices is debatable: who decides what is
      “best” and on what basis? One approach is to convene a body of industry
      experts to analyze projects from many organizations. These experts seek
      out practices whose effective performance is associated with successful
      projects and which are performed poorly or not at all on failed
      projects. Through these means, the experts reach consensus on the
      activities that consistently yield superior results and label them
      <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">best practices</em></span>.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Table 3-1. Requirements engineering good practices" href="#calibre_link-75">Table&nbsp;3-1</a> lists
      more than 50 practices, grouped into 7 categories, that can help all
      development teams do a better job on their requirements activities.
      Several of the practices contribute to more than one category, but each
      practice appears only once in the table. Most of these practices
      contribute to more effective communication among project stakeholders.
      Note that this chapter is titled “Good practices for requirements
      engineering,” not “Best practices.” It’s doubtful whether all of these
      practices will ever be systematically evaluated for this purpose.

      references to other chapters in this book or to other sources where you
      can learn more about the technique. These practices aren’t suitable for
      every situation, so use good judgment, common sense, and experience.
      Even the best practices need to be selected, applied, and adapted
      thoughtfully to appropriate situations by skilled business analysts.
      Different practices might be most appropriate for understanding the
      requirements for different portions of a given project. Use cases and
      user interface prototypes might help for the client side, whereas
      interface analysis is more valuable on the server side, for
      example.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1090" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1336" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1938" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1944" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2172" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2506" class="calibre"></a>The people who perform or take a lead role in these
      practices will vary from practice to practice and from project to
      project. The business analyst (BA) will play a major role with many of
      them, but not every project has a BA. The product owner could perform
      some of the practices on an agile project. Still other practices are the
      purview of the project manager. Think about who the right people in your

        unreasonable people. Customers, managers, and IT people sometimes
        appear to be unreasonable, but perhaps they are just uninformed. They
        might not know why you want to use certain practices and could be
        uncomfortable with unfamiliar terms and activities. Try educating your

        development involves elicitation, analysis, specification, and
        validation. Don’t expect to perform these activities in a simple
        linear, one-pass sequence, though. In practice, these activities are
        interwoven, incremental, and iterative, as shown in <a class="xref" title="Figure 3-1. Requirements development is an iterative process." href="#calibre_link-78">Figure&nbsp;3-1</a>. “Progressive
        refinement of detail” is a key operating phrase for requirements
        development, moving from initial concepts of what is needed toward
        further precision of understanding and expression.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-78" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2672" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000008.jpeg" alt="Requirements development is an iterative process." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;3-1.&nbsp;Requirements development is an iterative process.</div></div><p class="calibre3">If you’re the BA, you’ll be asking customers questions,
        listening to what they say, and watching what they do (elicitation).
        You’ll process this information to understand it, classify it in
        various categories, and relate the customer needs to possible software
        requirements (analysis). Your analysis might lead you to realize that
        you need to clarify some requirements, so you go back and do more
        elicitation. You’ll then structure the customer input and derived
        requirements as written requirement statements and diagrams
        (specification). While writing requirements, you might need to go back
        and do some additional analysis to close gaps in your knowledge. Next,
        you’ll ask some stakeholders to confirm that what you’ve captured is
        accurate and complete and to correct any errors (validation). You’ll
        do all this for the set of requirements that are most important and
        most timely for beginning software development. Validation could lead
        you to rewrite some unclear requirements, revisit some of your
        analysis activities, or even have to go back and perform additional
        elicitation. Then you’ll move on to the next portion of the project
        and do it all again. This iterative process continues throughout
        requirements development and possibly&mdash;as with agile
        projects&mdash;throughout the full project duration.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1433" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1457" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1962" class="calibre"></a>Because of the diversity of software development
        projects and organizational cultures, there is no single, formulaic
        approach to requirements development. <a class="xref" title="Figure 3-2. A representative requirements development process." href="#calibre_link-79">Figure&nbsp;3-2</a> suggests a
        process framework for requirements development that will work, with
        sensible adjustments, for many projects. The business need or market
        opportunity is the predecessor for the process shown in <a class="xref" title="Figure 3-2. A representative requirements development process." href="#calibre_link-79">Figure&nbsp;3-2</a>. These steps are
        generally performed approximately in numerical sequence, but the
        process is not strictly sequential. The first seven steps are
        typically performed once early in the project (although the team will
        need to revisit all of these activities periodically). The remaining
        steps are performed for each release or development iteration. Many of
        these activities can be performed iteratively, and they can be
        interwoven. For instance, you can perform steps 8, 9, and 10 in small
        chunks, performing a review (step 12) after each iteration.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-79" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2673" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000009.jpeg" alt="A diagram showing two boxes that list steps in the               requirements development process. The box on the left lists               seven steps that are performed about once in the project. These               steps are define business requirements, identify user classes,               identify user representatives, identify requirements decision               makers, plan elicitation, identify user requirements, and               prioritize user requirements. The box on the right lists 10 more               steps that might be performed once during each development               iteration.

        requirements management. Requirements management encompasses practices
        that help you deal with requirements after you have them in hand.
        These practices include version control and baselining, change
        control, tracking requirements status, and tracing requirements to
        other system elements. Requirements management will take place
        throughout the project’s duration at a low level of intensity.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 3-3. The distribution of requirements development effort over time varies for projects that follow different development life cycles." href="#calibre_link-80">Figure&nbsp;3-3</a>
        illustrates how some common software development life cycles allocate
        requirements effort across the product development period. The total
        requirements effort might not be much different for projects of
        comparable size that follow different life cycles, but the timing
        distribution of requirements work is very different. In the pure
        waterfall life cycle, you plan to do only one major release, so most
        of the requirements development effort is allocated for the beginning
        of the project (the solid line in <a class="xref" title="Figure 3-3. The distribution of requirements development effort over time varies for projects that follow different development life cycles." href="#calibre_link-80">Figure&nbsp;3-3</a>). This approach
        is still used on quite a few projects, and it is appropriate for some.
        But even if you plan a traditional “requirements phase” at the
        beginning of the project that then leads into design, you can count on
        having to do some additional requirements work throughout the
        project.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-80" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2674" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000010.jpeg" alt="The distribution of requirements development effort over time varies for projects that follow different development life cycles." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;3-3.&nbsp;The distribution of requirements development effort over time
          varies for projects that follow different development life
          cycles.</div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1434" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1886" class="calibre"></a>Projects that follow an iterative development process,
        such as the Rational Unified Process (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-81">[ref125]</a>), will
        work on requirements on every iteration through the development
        process, with a heavier emphasis in the first iteration (the dashed
        line in <a class="xref" title="Figure 3-3. The distribution of requirements development effort over time varies for projects that follow different development life cycles." href="#calibre_link-80">Figure&nbsp;3-3</a>).
        This is also the case if you are planning a series of phased releases,
        each of which delivers a significant fraction of the product’s
        ultimate functionality.</p><p class="calibre3">Agile and other incremental development projects aim to release
        functionality every few weeks (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-82">[ref148]</a>). They will
        have frequent but small requirements development efforts, as shown
        with the dotted line in <a class="xref" title="Figure 3-3. The distribution of requirements development effort over time varies for projects that follow different development life cycles." href="#calibre_link-80">Figure&nbsp;3-3</a>. Such projects
        begin by doing a first cut at collecting user requirements in the form
        of simple user stories that describe major objectives the user wants
        to accomplish with the help of the system. In this approach, you need
        to learn enough about the stories so that you can estimate their
        development effort and prioritize them. Prioritizing these user
        requirements lets you determine which ones to allocate to specific
        development increments, called iterations or sprints. Those allocated
        requirements can be explored in further detail in a just-in-time
        fashion for each development cycle.</p><p class="calibre3">Regardless of the life cycle your project follows, you should
        ask yourself for each release or iteration which of the activities
        shown in <a class="xref" title="Figure 3-2. A representative requirements development process." href="#calibre_link-79">Figure&nbsp;3-2</a>
        will add value and reduce risk. After you have completed step 17 for
        any portion of the requirements, you’re ready to commence construction
        of that part of the system. Repeat steps 8 through 17 with the next
        set of user requirements, which will lay the foundation for the
        subsequent release or increment.</p></div><div class="book" title="Good practices: Requirements elicitation"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2675">Good practices: Requirements elicitation</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-704" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1092" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1169" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1201" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1271" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1326" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1763" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2086" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2123" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2276" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2447" class="calibre"></a><a class="xref" title="Chapter 1. The essential software requirement" href="#calibre_link-21">Chapter&nbsp;1</a>
        discussed the three levels of requirements: business, user, and
        functional. These come from different sources at different times
        during the project, have different audiences and purposes, and need to
        be documented in different ways. You also need to elicit nonfunctional
        requirements, such as quality expectations in various dimensions, from
        appropriate sources. Following are some practices that can help with
        eliciting the myriad types of requirements information.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Define product vision and project
        scope</strong></span> The vision and scope document contains the product’s
        business requirements. The vision statement gives all stakeholders a
        common understanding of the product’s outcome. The scope defines the
        boundary between what’s in and what’s out for a specific release or
        iteration. Together, the vision and scope provide a reference against
        which to evaluate proposed requirements. The vision should remain
        relatively stable throughout the project, but each planned release or
        iteration needs its own scope statement. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 5. Establishing the business requirements" href="#calibre_link-32">Chapter&nbsp;5</a> for more
        information.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Identify user classes and their
        characteristics</strong></span> To avoid overlooking the needs of any user
        community, identify the various groups of users for your product. They
        might differ in frequency of use, features used, privilege levels, or
        experience. Describe aspects of their job tasks, attitudes, location,
        or personal characteristics that might influence product design.
        Create user personas, descriptions of imaginary people who will
        represent particular user classes. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 6. Finding the voice of the user" href="#calibre_link-61">Chapter&nbsp;6</a> for more
        information.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Select a product champion for each user
        class</strong></span> Identify an individual who can accurately serve as
        the literal voice of the customer for each user class. The product
        champion presents the needs of the user class and makes decisions on
        its behalf. This is easiest for internal information systems
        development, where your users are fellow employees. For commercial
        product development, build on your current relationships with major
        customers or beta test sites to locate appropriate product champions.
        See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 6. Finding the voice of the user" href="#calibre_link-61">Chapter&nbsp;6</a> for more
        information.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Conduct focus groups with typical
        users</strong></span> Convene groups of representative users of your
        previous products or of similar products. Collect their input on both
        functionality and quality characteristics for the product under
        development. Focus groups are particularly valuable for commercial
        product development, for which you might have a large and diverse
        customer base. Unlike product champions, focus groups generally do not
        have decision-making authority. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 7. Requirements elicitation" href="#calibre_link-31">Chapter&nbsp;7</a> for more information.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Work with user representatives to
        identify user requirements</strong></span> Explore with your user
        representatives the tasks they need to accomplish with the software
        and the value they’re trying to achieve. User requirements can be
        expressed in the form of use cases, user stories, or scenarios.
        Discuss the interactions between the users and the system that will
        allow them to complete each task. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 8. Understanding user requirements" href="#calibre_link-35">Chapter&nbsp;8</a> for more
        information.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Identify system events and
        responses</strong></span> List the external events that the system can
        experience and its expected response to each event. There are three
        classes of external events. Signal events are control signals or data
        received from external hardware devices. Temporal, or time-based,
        events trigger a response, such as an external data feed that your
        system generates at the same time every night. Business events trigger
        use cases in business applications. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 12. A picture is worth 1024 words" href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter&nbsp;12</a> for more

        interviews</strong></span> Interviews can be performed one-on-one or with a
        small group of stakeholders. They are an effective way to elicit
        requirements without taking too much stakeholder time because you meet
        with people to discuss only the specific requirements that are

        Questionnaires are a way to survey large groups of users to determine

        population but are particularly helpful with distributed groups. If
        questions are well written, questionnaires can help you quickly

        Existing documentation can help reveal how systems currently work or

        information about current systems, business processes, requirements
        specifications, competitor research, and COTS (commercial
        off-the-shelf) package user manuals. Reviewing and analyzing the
        documents can help identify functionality that needs to remain,
        functionality that isn’t used, how people do their jobs currently,
        what competitors offer, and what vendors say their software should do.

        requirements, and requirements that conform to government regulations,
        such as accessibility requirements. Other good candidates for reuse
        include glossaries, data models and definitions, stakeholder profiles,

        to ensure that all stakeholders understand them and scrutinizing them
        for errors, omissions, and other deficiencies. Analysis includes
        decomposing high-level requirements into appropriate levels of detail,
        building prototypes, evaluating feasibility, and negotiating
        priorities. The goal is to develop requirements of sufficient quality
        and precision that managers can construct realistic project estimates
        and technical staff can proceed with design, construction, and

        These different views will reveal insights and problems that no single

        stakeholders to understand the risks associated with implementing each
        requirement, including conflicts and dependencies with other
        requirements, dependencies on external factors, and technical
        obstacles. Requirements that are technically infeasible or overly

        to achieving the project’s business objectives.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Prioritize the requirements</strong></span>
        It’s important to prioritize requirements to ensure that the team

        an analytical approach to determine the relative implementation
        priority of product features, use cases, user stories, or functional
        requirements. Based on priority, determine which release or increment
        will contain each feature or set of requirements. Adjust priorities
        throughout the project as new requirements are proposed and as
        customer needs, market conditions, and business goals evolve. See

        reviewable way that is readily understandable by the intended
        audiences. You can record the business requirements in a vision and
        scope document. User requirements typically are represented in the
        form of use cases or user stories. Detailed software functional and
        nonfunctional requirements are recorded in a software requirements
        specification (SRS) or an alternative repository, such as a
        requirements management tool.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Adopt requirement document
        templates</strong></span> Adopt standard templates for documenting
        requirements in your organization, such as the vision and scope

        the SRS template in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 10. Documenting the requirements" href="#calibre_link-38">Chapter&nbsp;10</a>.
        The templates provide a consistent structure for recording various
        groups of requirements-related information. Even if you don’t store
        the requirements in traditional document form, the template will
        remind you of the various kinds of requirements information to explore
        and record.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Identify requirement origins</strong></span>
        To ensure that all stakeholders know why every requirement is needed,
        trace each one back to its origin. This might be a use case or some
        other customer input, a high-level system requirement, or a business
        rule. Recording the stakeholders who are affected by each requirement
        tells you whom to contact when a change is requested. Requirement
        origins can be identified through traceability links or by defining a
        requirement attribute for this purpose. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 27. Requirements management practices" href="#calibre_link-89">Chapter&nbsp;27</a> for more information on

        a unique identifying label. The convention must be robust enough to
        withstand additions, deletions, and changes made in the requirements
        over time. Labeling the requirements permits requirements traceability
        and the recording of changes made. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 10. Documenting the requirements" href="#calibre_link-38">Chapter&nbsp;10</a> for more information.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Record business rules</strong></span>
        Business rules include corporate policies, government regulations,
        standards, and computational algorithms. Document your business rules
        separately from a project’s requirements because they typically have
        an existence beyond the scope of a specific project. That is, treat
        business rules as an enterprise-level asset, not a project-level
        asset. Some rules will lead to functional requirements that enforce
        them, so define traceability links between those requirements and the
        corresponding rules. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 9. Playing by the rules" href="#calibre_link-39">Chapter&nbsp;9</a> for
        more information.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Specify nonfunctional

        does exactly what it’s supposed to do but does not satisfy the users’
        quality expectations. To avoid that problem, you need to go beyond the
        functionality discussion to understand the quality characteristics
        that are important to success. These characteristics include
        performance, reliability, usability, modifiability, and many others.
        Customer input on the relative importance of these quality attributes
        lets the developer make appropriate design decisions. Also, specify
        external interface requirements, design and implementation
        constraints, internationalization issues, and other nonfunctional
        requirements. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 14. Beyond functionality" href="#calibre_link-40">Chapter&nbsp;14</a> for more

        of reviewers who represent different perspectives (such as analyst,
        customer, developer, and tester), and carefully examine the written
        requirements, analysis models, and related information for defects.
        Informal preliminary reviews during requirements development are also
        valuable. It’s important to train the team members in how to perform
        effective requirements reviews and to adopt a review process for your
        organization. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 17. Validating the requirements" href="#calibre_link-60">Chapter&nbsp;17</a> for

        constitute an alternative view of the requirements. Writing tests
        requires you to think about how to tell if the expected functionality
        was correctly implemented. Derive tests from the user requirements to
        document the expected behavior of the product under specified
        conditions. Walk through the tests with customers to ensure that they
        reflect user expectations. Map the tests to the functional
        requirements to make sure that no requirements have been overlooked
        and that all have corresponding tests. Use the tests to verify the
        correctness of analysis models and prototypes. Agile projects often
        create acceptance tests in lieu of detailed functional requirements.

        letting BAs work with users to rapidly build executable mock-ups of a
        system. Users can interact with the simulated system to validate
        requirements and make design choices, making the requirements come to
        life before they are cast into the concrete of code. Simulation is not

        iteration. After the requirements have been baselined, changes should
        be made only through the project’s change control process. Give every
        version of the requirements specification a unique identifier to avoid
        confusion between drafts and baselines and between previous and
        current versions. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 2. Requirements from the customer’s perspective" href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter&nbsp;2</a> and <a class="xref" title="Chapter 27. Requirements management practices" href="#calibre_link-89">Chapter&nbsp;27</a> for more

        requirements changes</strong></span> Retain a history of the changes made
        to individual requirements. Sometimes you need to revert to an earlier
        version of a requirement or want to know how a requirement came to be
        in its current form. Record the dates that requirements were changed,
        the changes that were made, who made each change, and why. A version
        control tool or requirements management tool can help with these
        tasks.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Track the status of each
        requirement</strong></span> Establish a repository with one record for each
        discrete requirement of any type that affects implementation. Store
        key attributes about each requirement, including its status (such as
        proposed, approved, implemented, or verified), so you can monitor the
        number of requirements in each status category at any time. Tracking
        the status of each requirement as it moves through development and
        system testing provides insight into overall project status. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 27. Requirements management practices" href="#calibre_link-89">Chapter&nbsp;27</a> for more
        information.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Track requirements issues</strong></span>
        When busy people are working on a complex project, it’s easy to lose
        sight of the many issues that arise, including questions about
        requirements that need resolution, gaps to eradicate, and issues
        arising from requirements reviews. Issue-tracking tools can keep these
        items from falling through the cracks. Assign a single owner to each
        issue. Monitor the status of requirement issues to determine the
        overall state of the requirements. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 27. Requirements management practices" href="#calibre_link-89">Chapter&nbsp;27</a> for more
        information.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Maintain a requirements traceability
        matrix</strong></span> It’s often valuable&mdash;and sometimes required&mdash;to
        assemble a set of links that connect each functional requirement to
        the design and code elements that implement it and the tests that
        verify it. Such a <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">requirements traceability
        matrix</em></span> is helpful for confirming that all requirements are
        implemented and verified. It’s also useful during maintenance when a
        requirement has to be modified. The requirements traceability matrix
        can also connect functional requirements to the higher-level
        requirements from which they were derived and to other related
        requirements. Populate this matrix during development, not at the end.
        Tool support is essential on all but the smallest projects. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 29. Links in the requirements chain" href="#calibre_link-13">Chapter&nbsp;29</a> for more

        on a given project, but few software practitioners receive formal
        training in requirements engineering. Business analysis is a
        specialized and challenging role, with its own body of knowledge
        (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-44">[ref115]</a>). As with all technical disciplines, there
        is no substitute for experience. It isn’t reasonable to expect all
        people to be instinctively competent at the communication-intensive
        tasks of requirements engineering. Training can increase the
        proficiency and comfort level of those who serve as analysts, but it
        can’t compensate for absent interpersonal skills or a lack of interest
        in the role.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1068" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1315" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2278" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Train business
        analysts</strong></span> All team members who will perform BA tasks,
        whether they have the job title “business analyst” or not, should
        receive training in requirements engineering. Business analyst
        specialists need several days of training in the diverse activities
        that BAs typically perform. This will give them a solid foundation on
        which to build through their own experiences and advanced training. In
        addition to having an extensive tool kit of techniques, the skilled
        analyst is patient and well organized, has effective interpersonal and
        communication skills, and understands the application domain. See
        <a class="xref" title="Chapter 4. The business analyst" href="#calibre_link-7">Chapter&nbsp;4</a> for more information about
        this important role.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Educate stakeholders about
        requirements</strong></span> The most effective requirements training
        classes have an audience that spans multiple project functional areas,
        not just BAs. Users who will participate in software development
        should receive one or two days of education about requirements so they
        understand terminology, key concepts and practices, and why this is
        such an important contributor to project success. Development managers
        and customer managers will also find this information useful. Bringing
        together the various stakeholders for a class on software requirements
        can be an effective team-building activity. All parties will better
        appreciate the challenges their counterparts face and what the
        participants require from each other for the whole team to succeed.
        Some users who have attended our requirements classes have said that
        they came away with more sympathy for the software developers.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Educate developers about the application
        domain</strong></span> To help give developers a basic understanding of the
        application domain, arrange a seminar on the customer’s business
        activities, terminology, and objectives for the product being created.
        This can reduce confusion, miscommunication, and rework down the road.
        “Day-in-the-life” experiences in which developers accompany users to
        see how they perform their jobs are sound investments. You might also
        match each developer with a “user buddy” for the life of the project
        to translate jargon and explain business concepts. The product
        champion could play this role, as described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 6. Finding the voice of the user" href="#calibre_link-61">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Define a requirements engineering

        elicit, analyze, specify, validate, and manage requirements. Providing
        guidance on how to perform the key steps will help analysts do a
        consistently good job. It will also make it easier to plan each
        project’s requirements development and management tasks, schedule, and
        required resources. The project manager should incorporate
        requirements activities as discrete tasks in the project plan. See

        have both domain-specific and everyday meanings. A glossary could be a
        reusable enterprise-level asset. Developing a glossary could be an
        activity for new team members, because they will be the ones most

        coupled to a project’s requirements processes. The project manager
        should base project schedules, resources, and commitments on the
        requirements that are to be implemented. An alternative strategy is to
        timebox development cycles, such that the team estimates the scope of
        the work they can fit into an iteration of fixed duration. This is the
        approach taken by agile development projects. Scope is regarded as
        negotiable within the schedule. This transforms scope creep into
        “scope choice”&mdash;the product owner can ask for anything and as much as
        he wants, but he must prioritize it, and the team quits developing
        when they run out of time. Then the team plans a subsequent release
        for the remaining requirements.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Select an appropriate software
        development life cycle</strong></span> Your organization should define
        several development life cycles that are appropriate for various types
        of projects and different degrees of requirements uncertainty (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-91">[ref024]</a>). Each project manager should select and adapt the
        life cycle that best suits her project. Include requirements
        activities in your life cycle definitions. When possible, specify and
        implement sets of functionality incrementally so that you can deliver
        useful software to the customer as early as possible (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-82">[ref148]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-92">[ref213]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-93">[ref157]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Plan requirements approach</strong></span>
        Each project team should plan how it will handle its requirements
        development and management activities. An elicitation plan helps
        ensure that you identify and obtain input from appropriate
        stakeholders at the right stages of the project using the most
        appropriate techniques. The BA and project manager should work
        together to ensure that tasks and deliverables related to requirements
        engineering appear in the project management plan. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 7. Requirements elicitation" href="#calibre_link-31">Chapter&nbsp;7</a> for more information.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Estimate requirements effort</strong></span>
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">S</em></span>takeholders often want to know how long it’s
        going to take to develop the requirements for a project and what
        percentage of their total effort should be devoted to requirements
        development and management. Naturally, this depends on many factors.
        Consider the factors that would indicate that you should spend either
        more or less time than average to ensure the requirements lay a solid
        foundation for development (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>). See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 19. Beyond requirements development" href="#calibre_link-94">Chapter&nbsp;19</a> for more
        information.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Base project plans on
        requirements</strong></span> Develop plans and schedules for your project
        iteratively as the scope and detailed requirements become clear. Begin
        by estimating the effort needed to develop the user requirements from
        the initial product vision and project scope. Early cost and schedule
        estimates based on fuzzy requirements will be highly uncertain, but
        you can improve the estimates as your understanding of the
        requirements improves. On agile projects, the timeboxed nature of
        iterations means that planning involves adjusting the scope to fit
        within the fixed schedule and resource constraints.

        Conflicting user inputs must be resolved, commercial package
        components must be selected, change requests must be evaluated, and on
        and on. Because so many decisions involve requirements issues, it’s
        essential for the project team to identify and empower its
        requirements decision makers, preferably before they confront their
        first significant decision. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 2. Requirements from the customer’s perspective" href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter&nbsp;2</a> for more
        information.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Renegotiate project commitments when
        requirements change</strong></span> A project team makes commitments to
        deliver specific sets of requirements within a particular schedule and
        budget. As you incorporate new requirements into the project, evaluate
        whether you can still achieve the current commitments with the
        available resources. If not, communicate the project realities to
        management and negotiate new, realistically achievable commitments
        (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-57">[ref248]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-95">[ref073]</a>). You might also
        need to renegotiate commitments as requirements evolve from their
        fuzzy beginnings with initial implementation estimates to clear,
        validated requirements.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Analyze, document, and manage
        requirements-related risks</strong></span> Unanticipated events and
        conditions can wreak havoc on an unprepared project. Identify and

      insurance company, where she has worked for seven years. Her manager
      recently told her that, because of her stellar performance over the
      course of her career, he wanted her to help build a stronger BA career
      path for the rest of the department. He asked Molly for ideas of what to
      look for when hiring new BAs and how to train the ones already on the
      team. Molly was flattered. She reflected on her own career path to see
      if she could replicate any of her formative
      experiences.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Molly received a degree in computer science from a
      university whose curriculum did not discuss requirements; the focus was
      on the technical aspects of software development. Her first career was
      as an enterprise software developer. Within a year she knew it was not
      the job for her. Molly spent most of her time stuck in a cubicle writing
      code, desperately wanting to talk to other people. Over the next couple
      of years, she evolved her role into one of a BA, though she was still
      called a developer. She eventually convinced her manager to give her the
      more appropriate title and formally redefine her role. Molly also took a
      basic class on software requirements to learn the fundamentals. Then she
      got herself assigned to projects where she could try different practices
      and learn from more experienced mentors. Within a couple more years, she
      was able to develop a requirements process for her company. Molly had
      become the resident business analysis expert.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Molly recognizes that she shouldn’t expect a specific
      educational background when hiring new business analysts. She’ll focus
      on interviewing for the most important BA soft skills. Her training
      development program will emphasize the fundamentals of business analysis
      and how to apply the critical soft skills. Finally, she will establish a
      mentoring program for junior BAs.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">Explicitly or implicitly, someone performs the role of business
      analyst (BA) on every software project. A business analyst enables
      change in an organizational context by defining needs and recommending
      solutions that deliver value to stakeholders. The analyst elicits and
      analyzes others’ perspectives, transforms the information collected into
      a requirements specification, and communicates the information to other
      stakeholders. The analyst helps stakeholders find the difference between
      what they say they want and what they really need. She educates,
      questions, listens, organizes, and learns. It’s a tough job.</p><p class="calibre3">This chapter looks at the vital functions the BA performs, the
      skills and knowledge an effective analyst needs, and how you might
      develop such people in your organization (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-100">[ref244]</a>;
      <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-101">[ref117]</a>). <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-102">[ref256]</a> proposes a job
      description for a requirements analyst, and you can also access a sample
      BA job description from the companion content for this book.</p><div class="book" title="The business analyst role"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2687">The business analyst role</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-684" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-845" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2216" class="calibre"></a>The business analyst is the individual who has the
        primary responsibility to elicit, analyze, document, and validate the
        needs of the project stakeholders. The analyst serves as the principal
        interpreter through which requirements flow between the customer
        community and the software development team, as shown in <a class="xref" title="Figure 4-1. The business analyst bridges communication between customer and development stakeholders." href="#calibre_link-103">Figure&nbsp;4-1</a>. Many other
        communication pathways also are used, so the analyst isn’t solely
        responsible for information exchange on the project. The BA plays a
        central role in collecting and disseminating
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">product</em></span> information, whereas the project manager
        takes the lead in communicating <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">project</em></span>
        information.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-103" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2688" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000011.jpeg" alt="A figure in the center shows a business analyst.

          and development stakeholders.</div></div><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Business analyst</em></span> is a project role, not
        necessarily a job title. Synonyms for <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">business
        analyst</em></span> include <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">requirements analyst, systems
        analyst, requirements engineer, requirements manager, application
        analyst, business systems analyst, IT business analyst</em></span>, and
        simply <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">analyst</em></span>. These job titles are used
        inconsistently from organization to organization. One or more
        dedicated specialists could perform the role on a given project or it
        could be assigned to team members who also perform other project
        functions. These team members include project manager, product
        manager, product owner, subject matter expert (SME), developer, and
        sometimes even user.</p><p class="calibre3">It’s important to note that when a person who has another
        project role also serves as the business analyst, he is doing two
        distinct jobs. Consider a project manager who is also the BA on a
        project. A project manager needs to create and manage plans, including
        schedules and resource needs, based on work that BAs define. The
        project manager must help manage scope and deal with schedule changes
        as scope evolves. He might perform the project management role one
        minute, then change hats to execute the analyst practices the next.
        But these are distinct roles, requiring somewhat different skill
        sets.</p><p class="calibre3">In organizations that develop consumer products, the analyst
        role is often the product manager’s or marketing staff’s
        responsibility. Essentially, the product manager acts as a BA, often
        with additional emphasis on understanding the market landscape and
        anticipating external users’ needs. If the project has both a product
        manager and a BA, typically the product manager focuses on the
        external market and user demands, and the BA converts those into
        functional requirements.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-584" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1712" class="calibre"></a>Agile projects need business analysis skills, too. There
        will likely be a project role such as a product owner who performs
        some of the traditional BA tasks. Some teams find it helpful to have
        someone in an analyst role as well (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-104">[ref045]</a>). The BA
        can help represent the users and understand their needs, while
        performing the additional BA activities described later in the
        chapter. Regardless of the job title, the person performing the
        analyst tasks must have the skills, knowledge, and personality to
        perform the role well.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-2689" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Don’t assume that any talented developer or knowledgeable user
          can automatically be an effective business analyst without training,
          resource materials, and coaching.</p></div><p class="calibre3">A talented analyst can make the difference between a project
        that succeeds and one that struggles. One company discovered that they
        could inspect requirements specifications written by experienced
        analysts twice as fast as those written by novices because they
        contained fewer defects. In the popular Cocomo II model for project
        estimation, analyst experience and capability have a great influence
        on a project’s effort and cost (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-105">[ref022]</a>). Using
        highly experienced analysts can reduce the project’s overall effort by
        one-third compared to similar projects with inexperienced
        analysts.</p></div><div class="book" title="The business analyst’s tasks"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2690">The business analyst’s tasks</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The analyst must first understand the business objectives for
        the project and then define user, functional, and quality requirements
        that allow teams to estimate and plan the project and to design,
        build, and verify the product. The BA is also a leader and a
        communicator, turning vague customer notions into clear specifications
        that guide the software team’s work. This section describes some of
        the typical activities that you might perform while wearing an
        analyst’s hat.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Define business requirements</strong></span>
        Your work as a BA begins when you help the business or funding
        sponsor, product manager, or marketing manager define the project’s
        business requirements. You might suggest a template for a vision and
        scope document (see <a class="xref" title="Chapter 5. Establishing the business requirements" href="#calibre_link-32">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>) and work with
        those who hold the vision to help them express it clearly.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Plan the requirements
        approach</strong></span> The analyst should develop plans to elicit,
        analyze, document, validate, and manage requirements throughout the
        project. Work closely with the project manager to ensure these plans
        align with the overall project plans and will help achieve the project
        goals.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Identify project stakeholders and user
        classes</strong></span> Work with the business sponsors to select
        appropriate representatives for each user class (see <a class="xref" title="Chapter 6. Finding the voice of the user" href="#calibre_link-61">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>), enlist their
        participation, and negotiate their responsibilities. Explain what you
        would like from your customer collaborators and agree on an
        appropriate level of engagement from each one.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1023" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2691" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2492" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Elicit requirements</strong></span> A
        proactive analyst helps users articulate the system capabilities they
        need to meet their business objectives by using a variety of
        information-gathering techniques. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 7. Requirements elicitation" href="#calibre_link-31">Chapter&nbsp;7</a> and <a class="xref" title="Chapter 8. Understanding user requirements" href="#calibre_link-35">Chapter&nbsp;8</a> for further
        discussion.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Analyze requirements</strong></span> Look for
        derived requirements that are a logical consequence of what the
        customers requested and for implicit requirements that the customers
        seem to expect without saying so. Use requirements models to recognize
        patterns, identify gaps in the requirements, reveal conflicting
        requirements, and confirm that all requirements specified are within
        scope. Work with stakeholders to determine the necessary level of
        detail for specifying user and functional requirements.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Document requirements</strong></span> The
        analyst is responsible for documenting requirements in a
        well-organized and well-written manner that clearly describes the
        solution that will address the customer’s problem. Using standard
        templates accelerates requirements development by reminding the BA of
        topics to discuss with the user representatives.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Communicate requirements</strong></span> You
        must communicate the requirements effectively and efficiently to all
        parties. The BA should determine when it is helpful to represent
        requirements by using methods other than text, including various types
        of visual analysis models (discussed in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 5. Establishing the business requirements" href="#calibre_link-32">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>, <a class="xref" title="Chapter 12. A picture is worth 1024 words" href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter&nbsp;12</a>, and <a class="xref" title="Chapter 13. Specifying data requirements" href="#calibre_link-87">Chapter&nbsp;13</a>), tables, mathematical
        equations, and prototypes (discussed in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 15. Risk reduction through prototyping" href="#calibre_link-10">Chapter&nbsp;15</a>). Communication is not
        simply a matter of putting requirements on paper and tossing them over
        a wall. It involves ongoing collaboration with the team to ensure that
        they understand the information you are communicating.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Lead requirements validation</strong></span>
        The BA must ensure that requirement statements possess the desired
        characteristics that are discussed in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 11. Writing excellent requirements" href="#calibre_link-59">Chapter&nbsp;11</a> and that a solution based
        on the requirements will satisfy stakeholder needs. Analysts are the
        central participants in reviews of requirements. You should also
        review designs and tests that were derived from the requirements to
        ensure that the requirements were interpreted correctly. If you are
        creating acceptance tests in place of detailed requirements on an
        agile project, those should also be reviewed.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Facilitate requirements
        prioritization</strong></span> The analyst brokers collaboration and
        negotiation among the various stakeholders and the developers to
        ensure that they make sensible priority decisions in alignment with
        achieving business objectives.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Manage requirements</strong></span> A
        business analyst is involved throughout the entire software
        development life cycle, so she should help create, review, and execute
        the project’s requirements management plan. After establishing a
        requirements baseline for a given product release or development
        iteration, the BA’s focus shifts to tracking the status of those
        requirements, verifying their satisfaction in the product, and
        managing changes to the requirements baseline. With input from various
        colleagues, the analyst collects traceability information that
        connects individual requirements to other system elements.</p></div><div class="book" title="Essential analyst skills"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2692">Essential analyst skills</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-686" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1417" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1460" class="calibre"></a>It isn’t reasonable to expect people to serve as
        analysts without sufficient training, guidance, and experience. They
        won’t do a good job, and they’ll find the experience frustrating. The
        job includes many “soft skills” that are more people-oriented than
        technical. Analysts need to know how to use a variety of elicitation
        techniques and how to represent information in forms other than
        natural-language text. An effective BA combines strong communication,
        facilitation, and interpersonal skills with technical and business
        domain knowledge and the right personality for the job. Patience and a
        genuine desire to work with people are key success factors. The skills
        described in this section are particularly important. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-102">[ref256]</a> provides a comprehensive table of skills that are
        appropriate for junior-level, mid-level, and senior-level requirements
        analysts.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Listening skills</strong></span> To become
        proficient at two-way communication, learn how to listen effectively.
        Active listening involves eliminating distractions, maintaining an
        attentive posture and eye contact, and restating key points to confirm
        your understanding. You need to grasp what people are saying and also
        to read between the lines to detect what they might be hesitant to
        say. Learn how your collaborators prefer to communicate, and avoid
        imposing your personal filter of understanding on what you hear from
        the customers. Watch for unstated assumptions that underlie either
        what you hear from others or your own interpretation.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Interviewing and questioning
        skills</strong></span> Most requirements input comes through discussions,
        so the BA must be able to interact with diverse individuals and groups
        about their needs. It can be intimidating to work with senior managers
        and with highly opinionated or aggressive individuals. You need to ask
        the right questions to surface essential requirements information. For
        example, users naturally focus on the system’s normal, expected
        behaviors. However, much code gets written to handle exceptions.
        Therefore, you must also probe to identify error conditions and
        determine how the system should respond. With experience, you’ll
        become skilled in the art of asking questions that reveal and clarify
        uncertainties, disagreements, assumptions, and unstated expectations
        (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-70">[ref082]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Thinking on your feet</strong></span>
        Business analysts always need to be aware of the existing information
        and to process new information against it. They need to spot
        contradictions, uncertainty, vagueness, and assumptions so they can
        discuss them in the moment if appropriate. You can try to script the
        perfect set of interview questions; however, you’ll always need to ask
        something you could not have foreseen. You need to draft good
        questions, listen clearly to the responses, and quickly come up with
        the next smart thing to say or ask. Sometimes you won’t be asking a
        question but rather giving an appropriate example in context to help
        your stakeholder formulate the next answer.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Analytical skills</strong></span> An
        effective business analyst can think at both high and low levels of
        abstraction and knows when to move from one to another. Sometimes, you
        must drill down from high-level information into details. In other
        situations, you’ll need to generalize from a specific need that one
        user described to a set of requirements that will satisfy multiple
        stakeholders. BAs need to understand complex information coming from
        many sources and to solve hard problems related to that information.
        They need to critically evaluate the information to reconcile
        conflicts, separate user “wants” from the underlying true needs, and
        distinguish solution ideas from requirements.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2693" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1208" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2694" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1595" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2695" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2696" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2697" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Systems thinking
        skills</strong></span> Although a business analyst must be detail-oriented,
        he must also see the big picture. The BA must check requirements
        against what he knows about the whole enterprise, the business
        environment, and the application to look for inconsistencies and
        impacts. The BA needs to understand the interactions and relationships
        among the people, processes, and technology related to the system
        (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-44">[ref115]</a>). If a customer requests a requirement for
        his functional area, the BA needs to judge whether the requirement
        affects other parts of the system in unobvious ways.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Learning skills</strong></span> Analysts must
        learn new material quickly, whether it is about new requirements
        approaches or the application domain. They need to be able to
        translate that knowledge into practice efficiently. Analysts should be
        efficient and critical readers because they have to wade through a lot
        of material and grasp the essence quickly. You do not have to be an
        expert in the domain, so don’t hesitate to ask clarifying questions.
        Be honest about what you don’t know. It’s okay not to know it all, but
        it’s not okay to hide your ignorance.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Facilitation skills</strong></span> The
        ability to facilitate requirements discussions and elicitation
        workshops is a vital analyst capability. Facilitation is the act of
        leading a group towards success. Facilitation is essential when
        collaboratively defining requirements, prioritizing needs, and
        resolving conflicts. A neutral facilitator who has strong questioning,
        observational, and facilitation skills can help a group build trust
        and improve the sometimes tense relationship between business and IT
        staff. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 7. Requirements elicitation" href="#calibre_link-31">Chapter&nbsp;7</a> presents guidelines
        for facilitating requirements elicitation activities.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Leadership skills</strong></span> A strong
        analyst can influence a group of stakeholders to move in a certain
        direction to accomplish a common goal. Leadership requires
        understanding a variety of techniques to negotiate agreements among
        project stakeholders, resolve conflicts, and make decisions. The
        analyst should create a collaborative environment, fostering trust
        among the various stakeholder groups who might not understand each
        other’s motivations, needs, and constraints.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Observational skills</strong></span> An
        observant analyst will detect comments made in passing that might turn
        out to be significant. By watching a user perform her job or use a
        current application, a good observer can detect subtleties that the
        user might not think to mention. Strong observational skills sometimes
        expose new areas for elicitation discussions, thereby revealing
        additional requirements.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Communication skills</strong></span> The
        principal deliverable from requirements development is a set of
        written requirements that communicates information effectively among
        customers, marketing, managers, and technical staff. The analyst needs
        a solid command of the language and the ability to express complex
        ideas clearly, both in written form and verbally. You must be able to
        write for multiple audiences, including customers who have to validate
        the requirements and developers who need clear, precise requirements
        for implementation. A BA needs to speak clearly, adapting to local
        terminology and to regional differences in dialect. Also, a BA must be
        able to summarize and present information at the level of detail the
        target audience needs.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Organizational skills</strong></span> BAs
        must contend with a vast array of jumbled information gathered during
        elicitation and analysis. Coping with rapidly changing information and
        structuring all the bits into a coherent whole demands exceptional
        organizational skills and the patience and tenacity to make sense from
        ambiguity and disarray. As an analyst, you need to be able to set up
        an information architecture to support the project information as it
        grows throughout the project (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-42">[ref013]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1505" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Modeling skills</strong></span>
        Models ranging from the venerable flowchart through structured
        analysis models (data flow diagram, entity-relationship diagram, and
        similar diagrams) to Unified Modeling Language (UML) notations should
        be part of every analyst’s repertoire (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-42">[ref013]</a>).
        Some will be useful when communicating with users, others when
        communicating with developers, and still others purely for analysis to
        help the BA improve the requirements. The BA will need to know when to
        select specific models based on how they add value. Also, he’ll need
        to educate other stakeholders on the value of using these models and
        how to read them. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 5. Establishing the business requirements" href="#calibre_link-32">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>, <a class="xref" title="Chapter 12. A picture is worth 1024 words" href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter&nbsp;12</a>, and <a class="xref" title="Chapter 13. Specifying data requirements" href="#calibre_link-87">Chapter&nbsp;13</a> for overviews of several
        types of analysis models.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Interpersonal skills</strong></span> Analysts
        must be able to get people with competing interests to work together
        as a team. An analyst should feel comfortable talking with individuals
        in diverse job functions and at all levels of the organization. A BA
        should speak the language of the audience she is talking to, not using
        technical jargon with business stakeholders. She might need to work
        with virtual teams whose members are separated by geography, time
        zones, cultures, or native languages. A BA should be easy to
        communicate with and be clear and consistent when communicating with
        team members.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Creativity</strong></span> The BA is not
        merely a scribe who records whatever customers say. The best analysts
        invent potential requirements for customers to consider (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-106">[ref199]</a>). They conceive innovative product capabilities,
        imagine new markets and business opportunities, and think of ways to
        surprise and delight their customers. A really valuable BA finds
        creative ways to satisfy needs that users didn’t even know they had.
        Analysts can offer new ideas because they are not as close as users to
        the problem being solved. Analysts have to be careful to avoid
        gold-plating the solution, though; don’t simply add new requirements
        to the specification without customer approval.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2698" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Practicing what you teach</div><p class="calibre3">An experienced BA and developer once saved me from myself. I
          was talking to my friend and colleague Tanya about a software
          service I thought I needed for my website. I told her that I needed
          some kind of script that could intercept certain email messages I
          received and parse certain information out of them. I didn’t know
          how to write such a script, so I asked Tanya how she would suggest
          proceeding.</p><p class="calibre3">Tanya replied, “Excuse me, Karl, but I don’t think that’s your
          real requirement. Your real requirement is to get the information
          you need in some other way besides manually reading and processing
          emails as they arrive in your inbox.” She was exactly correct. I had
          fallen into the oh-so-common trap of a user attempting to specify a
          solution as a requirement. Fortunately, this observant BA detected
          my mistake. Tanya stepped back a bit and immediately grasped the
          underlying issue. When you do that, you almost always find that
          there are multiple ways you could solve the problem, some of which
          might be better than the first one that popped into your head. My
          smart friend Tanya reminded me how important it is for the skillful
          BA to dig below a presented solution and really understand the
          user’s objectives.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Essential analyst knowledge"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2699">Essential analyst knowledge</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-674" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-679" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1440" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2345" class="calibre"></a>In addition to having specific capabilities and personal
        characteristics, business analysts need a breadth of knowledge, much
        of which is gained through experience. They need to understand
        contemporary requirements engineering practices and how to apply them
        in the context of various software development life cycles. They might
        need to educate and persuade those who are not familiar with
        established requirements practices. The effective analyst has a rich
        tool kit of techniques available and knows when&mdash;and when not&mdash;to use
        each one.</p><p class="calibre3">BAs need to thread requirements development and management
        activities through the entire project life span. An analyst with a
        sound understanding of project management, development life cycles,
        risk management, and quality engineering can help prevent requirements
        issues from torpedoing the project. In a commercial development
        setting, the BA will benefit from knowledge of product management
        concepts. BAs benefit from a basic level of knowledge about the
        architecture and operating environment, so that they can engage in
        technical conversations about priorities and nonfunctional
        requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">Knowledge of the business, the industry, and the organization
        are powerful assets for an effective BA (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-44">[ref115]</a>).
        The business-savvy analyst can minimize miscommunications with users.
        Analysts who understand the organization and business domains often
        detect unstated assumptions and implicit requirements. They can
        suggest ways that users could improve their business processes or
        propose valuable functionality that no other stakeholder thought of.
        Understanding the industry domain can be particularly helpful in a
        commercial environment so analysts can offer marketplace and
        competitive product analysis.</p></div><div class="book" title="The making of a business analyst"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2700">The making of a business analyst</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Great business analysts are grown from diverse backgrounds of
        education and work experience, so they will likely have gaps in their
        knowledge and skill sets. All analysts should decide which of the
        knowledge and skills described in this chapter pertain to their
        situation and actively seek to fill their own gaps. The International
        Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA) describes the competencies that
        entry-level, junior, intermediate, and senior business analysts should
        exhibit across the common BA activities (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-101">[ref117]</a>).
        All new BAs will benefit from mentoring and coaching from those who
        have more experience, perhaps in the form of an apprenticeship. Let’s
        explore how people with different backgrounds might move into the
        analyst role and see some of the challenges and risks they’ll
        face.</p><div class="book" title="The former user"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2701">The former user</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Corporate IT departments often have business analysts who
          migrated into that role after working on the business side as a user
          of information systems. These individuals understand the business
          and the work environment, so they can easily gain the trust of their
          former colleagues. They speak the user’s language, and they know the
          existing systems and business processes.</p><p class="calibre3">On the downside, former users who are now BAs might know
          little about software engineering or how to communicate with
          technical people. If they aren’t familiar with modeling techniques,
          they will express all information in textual form. Users who become
          BAs need to learn more about the technical side of software
          development so they can represent information in the most
          appropriate forms for their multiple audiences.</p><p class="calibre3">Some former users believe they understand what is needed
          better than current users do, so they don’t solicit or respect input
          from those who will actually use the new system. Recent users can be
          stuck in the here-and-now of the current ways of working, such that
          they don’t see opportunities to improve business processes with the
          help of a new information system. It’s also easy for a former user
          to think of requirements strictly from a user interface perspective.
          Focusing on solution ideas can impose unnecessary design constraints
          and often fails to solve the real problem.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2702" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">From medical technologist to business analyst</div><p class="calibre3">The senior manager of a medical devices division in a large
            company had a problem. “Two years ago, I hired three medical
            technologists into my division to represent our customers’ needs,”
            he said. “They’ve done a great job, but they’re no longer current
            in medical technology, so they can’t speak accurately for what our
            customers need today. What’s a reasonable career path for them
            now?”</p><p class="calibre3">This manager’s former medical technologists were good
            candidates to become business analysts. Although they weren’t up
            on the latest happenings in the hospital laboratory, they could
            still communicate with other med techs. Spending two years in a
            product development environment gave them a good appreciation for
            how it works. They needed some additional training in
            requirements-writing techniques, but these employees had
            accumulated a range of valuable experiences that could make them
            effective analysts. These former users did indeed transition into
            the BA role successfully.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="The former developer or tester"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2703">The former developer or tester</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Project managers who lack a dedicated BA often expect a
          developer to do the job. Unfortunately, the skills and personality
          needed for requirements development aren’t the same as those needed
          for software development. Some developers have little patience with
          users, preferring to work with the code and promote the glamour of
          technology. Of course, many other developers do recognize the
          criticality of the requirements process and can work as analysts
          when necessary. Those who enjoy collaborating with customers to
          understand the needs that drive software development are good
          candidates to specialize in business analysis.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1734" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2217" class="calibre"></a>The developer-turned-analyst might need to learn more
          about the business domain. Developers can easily lapse into
          technical thinking and jargon, focusing on the software to be built
          instead of the customers’ needs. They’ll need to get up to speed on
          current best practices for requirements engineering. Developers will
          benefit from training and mentoring in the diverse soft skills that
          the best analysts master, as described earlier in this
          chapter.</p><p class="calibre3">Testers aren’t commonly asked to perform the analyst role.
          However, a tester often has an analytical mindset that can lend
          itself to being a good BA. Testers are already used to thinking
          about exceptions and how to break things, a useful skill for finding
          gaps in requirements. As with a former developer, a tester will have
          to learn about good requirements engineering practices. She might
          also need to become more knowledgeable about the business
          domain.</p></div><div class="book" title="The former (or concurrent) project manager"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2704">The former (or concurrent) project manager</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Project managers are sometimes asked to also fill the role of
          business analyst, probably because they have some of the same skills
          and domain knowledge required. This can be an effective role change.
          Project managers will already be used to working with the
          appropriate teams, understanding the organization and business
          domains, and demonstrating strong communication skills. They will
          likely be good at listening, negotiation, and facilitation. They
          should have strong organizational and writing skills as well.</p><p class="calibre3">However, the former project manager will have to learn more
          about requirements engineering practices. It is one thing to set up
          a plan, allocate resources, and coordinate the activities of
          analysts and other team members. It is a very different matter to
          perform the business analyst role yourself. Former project managers
          must learn to focus on understanding the business needs and
          prioritizing those within existing project schedules, rather than
          focusing on timelines, resources, and budget constraints. They will
          need to develop the analysis, modeling, and interviewing skills that
          are less important for project managers but are essential to BA
          success.</p></div><div class="book" title="The subject matter expert"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2705">The subject matter expert</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-107">[ref255]</a> recommends that the business analyst
          be an application domain expert or a SME, as opposed to being a
          typical user: “SMEs can determine, based on their experience,
          whether the requirements are reasonable, how they extend the
          existing system, how the proposed architecture should be designed,
          and the impacts on users, among other areas.” Some product
          development organizations hire expert users of their products who
          have extensive domain experience into their companies to serve
          either as analysts or as user surrogates.</p><p class="calibre3">There are risks here, though, too. The business analyst who is
          a domain expert might specify the system’s requirements to suit his
          own preferences, rather than addressing the legitimate needs of the
          various user classes. He might have blinders on when thinking about
          requirements and be less creative in proposing new ideas. SMEs are
          expert in their understanding of the “as-is” system; they sometimes
          have difficulty imagining the “to-be” system. It often works better
          to have a BA from the development team work with the SME, who then
          serves as a key user representative or product champion. The product
          champion is described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 6. Finding the voice of the user" href="#calibre_link-61">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>.</p></div><div class="book" title="The rookie"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2706">The rookie</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-566" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-585" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2707" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-673" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1713" class="calibre"></a>Becoming a business analyst is a good entry point into
          the information technology arena for someone right out of school or
          coming from a completely unrelated job. The new graduate will have
          little, if any, relevant experience or knowledge. He will likely be
          hired into the BA role because he demonstrates many of the skills
          required to be a good analyst. An advantage of hiring a novice as a
          BA is that he will have few preconceived notions about how
          requirements processes should work.</p><p class="calibre3">Because he lacks related experience and knowledge, a new
          graduate will have much to learn about how to execute the BA tasks
          and the intricacies of the practices. The recent graduate also needs
          to learn enough about the software development process to understand
          the challenges that developers, testers, and other team members face
          so he can collaborate effectively with them. Mentoring can reduce
          the learning curve for a novice BA and instill good habits from the
          outset.</p><p class="calibre3">No matter what his background, a creative business analyst can
          apply it to enhance his effectiveness. The analyst needs to gain the
          knowledge and skills he is lacking, build on any past experiences,
          and practice performing the BA tasks to become more proficient. All
          of these help create the well-rounded BA (<a class="xref" title="Figure 4-2. Knowledge, skills, and experience feed into creating an effective business analyst." href="#calibre_link-108">Figure&nbsp;4-2</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-108" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2708" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000012.jpeg" alt="Knowledge, skills, and experience feed into creating an effective business analyst." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;4-2.&nbsp;Knowledge, skills, and experience feed into creating an

        analyst functions still need to be performed, but the individual who
        does them might not be called a BA. Some agile approaches have a key
        team member called the <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">product owner</em></span>. The person
        in that role might perform some of the traditional business analysis
        activities, as well as providing the product vision, communicating
        constraints, prioritizing the product backlog of remaining work, and
        making the ultimate decisions about the product (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-104">[ref045]</a>). Other projects maintain a business analyst role
        separate from the product owner. Additionally, other team members,
        such as developers, perform portions of the analyst role. The point is
        that, regardless of the project’s development approach, the tasks
        associated with the BA role still have to get done. The team will
        benefit from having members who possess the skills associated with
        business analysts.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-675" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2710" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-828" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-830" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1342" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1728" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2254" class="calibre"></a>Often, in an organization moving toward an agile
        development approach, the BA finds herself unsure as to how she can
        most effectively contribute to the project. In the spirit of agile
        development, the analyst has to be willing to step out of a
        preconceived role of “business analyst” and fill in where needed to
        help deliver a successful product. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-109">[ref095]</a> offers a

            everything in specifications to the nth degree. Some purists
            suggest agile projects should have little or no requirements
            documentation. Neither extreme is ideal.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Help determine the best approach to document the backlog,

        other’s needs and constraints. In reality, though, the producers and
        consumers of a software product share common objectives. For corporate
        information systems development, all parties work for the same
        company, so they all benefit from improvements to the corporate bottom
        line. For commercial products, happy customers generate revenue for
        the producer and satisfaction for the developers.</p><p class="calibre3">The business analyst has the major responsibility for forging a

      implement a new online product catalog for the company’s customer
      service representatives. The drafted SRS is going through review when
      the marketing manager says he wants to add a “Like this product”
      feature. Karen’s first instinct is to push back; there is already
      concern about meeting schedules with the current requirements set. But
      then she realizes that maybe that’s a smart feature to add, because
      customer service representatives can promote the most-liked products
      with other customers. Before she elicits and documents functional
      requirements for this feature, she needs an objective analysis about
      whether this feature should be added to the scope or
      not.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">When she explains to the marketing manager the need to
      analyze this request further, he responds, “Well, soon the developers
      are going to be in there changing code anyway. How hard is it to add
      just one tiny feature?” Karen’s analysis determines that the proposed
      feature lies outside the project’s scope: it won’t contribute to the
      business objectives to reduce the customer service representatives’
      average call time, and it wouldn’t be simple to implement. Karen needs
      to be able to clearly articulate why the feature isn’t in scope to the
      marketing manager, who doesn’t have the business objectives readily in
      mind.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">As you saw in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 1. The essential software requirement" href="#calibre_link-21">Chapter&nbsp;1</a> business requirements
      represent the top of the requirements chain. They define the vision of
      the solution and the scope of the project that will implement the
      solution. The user requirements and functional requirements must align
      with the context and objectives that the business requirements
      establish. Requirements that don’t help the project achieve its business
      objectives shouldn’t be implemented.</p><p class="calibre3">A project without a clearly defined and well-communicated
      direction invites disaster. Project participants can unwittingly work at
      cross-purposes if they have different objectives and priorities. The
      stakeholders will never agree on the requirements if they lack a common
      understanding of the project’s business objectives. Without this
      understanding up front, project deadlines will likely be missed and
      budgets will likely be overrun as the team struggles to deliver the
      right product.</p><p class="calibre3">This chapter describes the vision and scope document, a
      deliverable that contains the project’s business requirements. <a class="xref" title="Figure 5-3. Suggested template for a vision and scope document." href="#calibre_link-113">Figure&nbsp;5-3</a> later in this
      chapter suggests a template for the vision and scope document. But
      before we get to the template, let’s see just what we mean by “business
      requirements.”</p><div class="book" title="Defining business requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2716">Defining business requirements</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-736" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-738" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1487" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1608" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1719" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1767" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1770" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1951" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2090" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2543" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2554" class="calibre"></a>“Business requirements” refers to a set of information
        that, in the aggregate, describes a need that leads to one or more
        projects to deliver a solution and the desired ultimate business
        outcomes. Business opportunities, business objectives, success
        metrics, and a vision statement make up the business
        requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">Business requirements issues must be resolved before the
        functional and nonfunctional requirements can be fully specified. A
        statement of the project’s scope and limitations helps greatly with
        discussions of proposed features and target releases. The business
        requirements provide a reference for making decisions about proposed
        requirement changes and enhancements. We recommend displaying the
        business objectives, vision, and scope highlights in every
        requirements elicitation session so the team can quickly judge whether
        a proposed requirement is in or out of scope.</p><div class="book" title="Identifying desired business benefits"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2717">Identifying desired business benefits</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The business requirements set the context for, and enable the
          measurement of, the benefits the business hopes to achieve from
          undertaking a project. Organizations should not initiate any project
          without a clear understanding of the value it will add to the
          business. Set measurable targets with business objectives, and then
          define success metrics that allow you to measure whether you are on
          track to meet those objectives.</p><p class="calibre3">Business requirements might come from funding sponsors,
          corporate executives, marketing managers, or product visionaries.
          However, it can be challenging to identify and communicate the
          business benefits. Team members sometimes aren’t exactly sure what
          the project is intended to accomplish. Sometimes, sponsors don’t
          want to set objectives in a measurable fashion and then be held
          accountable for achieving them. There could be multiple important
          stakeholders who don’t agree on what the objectives should be. The
          business analyst can ensure that the right stakeholders are setting
          the business requirements and facilitate elicitation,
          prioritization, and conflict resolution. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>
          suggests some questions that the BA can ask to help elicit business
          requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">The business benefit has to represent a true value for the
          project’s sponsors and to the product’s customers. For example,
          simply merging two systems into one is not a reasonable business
          objective. Customers don’t care if they are using an application
          that involves 1, 5, or even 10 systems. They care about issues like
          increasing revenue and decreasing costs. Merging two systems might
          be part of the solution, but it is rarely the true business
          objective. Regulatory and legal compliance projects also have clear
          business objectives. Often the objectives are phrased as risk
          avoidance, possibly to avoid getting sued or being put out of
          business.</p></div><div class="book" title="Product vision and project scope"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2718">Product vision and project scope</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Two core elements of the business requirements are the vision
          and the scope. The <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">product vision</em></span> succinctly
          describes the ultimate product that will achieve the business
          objectives. This product could serve as the complete solution for
          the business requirements or as just a portion of the solution. The
          vision describes what the product is about and what it ultimately
          could become. It provides the context for making decisions
          throughout the product’s life, and it aligns all stakeholders in a
          common direction. The <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">project scope</em></span> identifies
          what portion of the ultimate product vision the current project or
          development iteration will address. The statement of scope draws the
          boundary between what’s in and what’s out for this project.</p><div class="note" title="Important"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-2719" class="calibre"></a>Important</h3><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1759" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2082" class="calibre"></a>The product vision ensures that we all know where we
            are hoping to go eventually. The project scope ensures that we are
            all talking about the same thing for the immediate project or
            iteration.</p></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2720" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Make sure the vision solves the problem</div><p class="calibre3">In one of our training courses, we give students a business
            problem and a corresponding business objective. Throughout the
            exercise, we periodically provide additional details about the
            requirements. At each step, we ask the students to conceive a
            solution to the problem, given the information they have. By the
            end of the exercise, all of the students’ solution ideas are
            similar, but rarely do any of them actually solve the original
            problem!</p><p class="calibre3">This mimics what we see on real projects. Teams might set
            clear objectives and then specify, develop, and test the system,
            without checking against the objectives along the way. A
            stakeholder might come up with a “shiny” new feature she wants
            implemented. The team adds it because it seems reasonable and
            interesting. However, months down the road, the delivered system
            doesn’t solve the original problem, despite all of its cool
            features.</p></div><p class="calibre3">The vision applies to the product as a whole. The vision
          should change relatively slowly as a product’s strategic positioning
          or a company’s business objectives evolve over time. The scope
          pertains to a specific project or iteration that will implement the
          next increment of the product’s functionality, as shown in <a class="xref" title="Figure 5-1. The product vision encompasses the scope for each planned release, which is less well defined the farther out you look." href="#calibre_link-114">Figure&nbsp;5-1</a>. Scope is more
          dynamic than vision because the stakeholders adjust the contents of
          each release within its schedule, budget, resource, and quality
          constraints. Scope for the current release should be clear, but the
          scope of future releases will be fuzzier the farther out you look.
          The team’s goal is to manage the scope of a specific development or
          enhancement project as a defined subset of the strategic vision for
          the product.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-114" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2721" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000013.jpeg" alt="The product vision encompasses the scope for each planned release, which is less well defined the farther out you look." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;5-1.&nbsp;The product vision encompasses the scope for each planned

            defined the business objectives and vision for this system early
            in the process; they won’t change substantially over the next few
            years. The agency has planned 15 releases of portions of the
            ultimate system, each created by a separate project team and
            having its own scope description. Some projects will run in
            parallel, because certain of them are relatively independent of
            each other and some have longer timelines than others. Each scope
            description must align with the overall product vision and
            interlock with the scope for the other projects to ensure that
            nothing is inadvertently omitted and that lines of responsibility
            are clear.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Conflicting business requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2723">Conflicting business requirements</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Business requirements collected from multiple sources might

          likely business interests of the kiosk developer, retailer, and

          business.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-115" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2724" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000014.jpeg" alt="Illustration showing three boxes that show the                 business interests for three stakeholders regarding a project                 to put kiosks in stores: the kiosk developers, the retailer,                 and the customer. The kiosk developers’ business interests                 are: generate revenue by leasing or selling the kiosk to the                 retailer; sell consumables through the kiosk to the customer;                 attract retailers to the brand; and make a wide variety of                 products or services available. The retailer’s business                 interests are: maximize revenue from the available floor                 space; attract new customers to the store; increase sales to                 existing customers; increase profit margins; and little kiosk                 maintenance required. The customer’s business interests are:                 broad selection of products or services available; find                 desired products quickly; spend less time purchasing; and an                 easy-to-understand purchase process." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;5-2.&nbsp;Stakeholders for a kiosk don’t always have congruent
            business interests.</div></div><p class="calibre3">The various stakeholders’ objectives sometimes are in
          alignment. For instance, both the kiosk developers and the customers
          want to have a wide variety of products or services available
          through the kiosk. However, some business objectives could conflict.
          The customer wants to spend less time purchasing goods and services,
          but the retailer would prefer to have customers linger in the store
          and spend more money. The tension among stakeholders with different
          goals and constraints can lead to clashing business requirements.
          The project’s decision makers must resolve these conflicts before
          the analyst can detail the kiosk’s requirements. The focus should be
          on delivering the maximum business value to the primary
          stakeholders. It’s easy to be distracted by superficial product
          characteristics that don’t really address the business
          objectives.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-699" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-745" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-811" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1056" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1472" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1726" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1780" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2103" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2271" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2530" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2534" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2537" class="calibre"></a>The project’s decision makers shouldn’t expect the
          software team to resolve conflicts among various stakeholders. As
          more constituencies with diverse interests climb aboard, scope will
          grow. Uncontrolled scope creep, in which stakeholders overstuff the
          new system in an attempt to satisfy every interest, can cause the
          project to topple under its own weight. A BA can help by surfacing
          potential areas of conflict and differing assumptions, flagging
          conflicting business objectives, noting when requested features
          don’t achieve those objectives, and facilitating conflict
          resolution. Resolving such issues is often a political and power
          struggle, which lies outside the scope of this book.</p><p class="calibre3">Long-duration projects often experience a change in decision
          makers partway through. If this happens to you, immediately revisit
          the baselined business requirements with the new decision makers.
          They need to be aware of the existing business requirements, which
          they might want to modify. If so, the project manager will have to
          adjust budgets, schedules, and resources, while the BA might need to
          work with stakeholders to update user and functional requirements
          and reset their priorities.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Vision and scope document"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2725">Vision and scope document</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">vision and scope document</em></span> collects the
        business requirements into a single deliverable that sets the stage
        for the subsequent development work. Some organizations create a
        project charter (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-57">[ref248]</a>) or a business case
        document that serves a similar purpose. Organizations that build
        commercial software often create a market (or marketing) requirements
        document (MRD). An MRD might go into more detail about the target
        market segments and the issues that pertain to commercial
        success.</p><p class="calibre3">The owner of the vision and scope document is the project’s
        executive sponsor, funding authority, or someone in a similar role. A
        business analyst can work with this individual to articulate the

        to the business requirements should come from people who have a clear
        sense of why they are undertaking the project. These individuals might

        any template, adapt this to meet the specific needs of your own
        projects. If you already have recorded some of this information
        elsewhere, do not duplicate it in the vision and scope document. Some

        a high level; the scope details are represented by each release
        baseline that the team defines. Major new projects should have both a
        complete vision and scope document and an SRS. (See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 10. Documenting the requirements" href="#calibre_link-38">Chapter&nbsp;10</a> for an SRS template.) Each
        iteration, release, or enhancement project for an evolving product can
        include its own scope statement in that project’s requirements
        documentation, rather than creating a separate vision and scope
        document.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2727" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Template tactics</div><p class="calibre3">Templates provide a consistent way to organize information
          from one project to the next. They help me remember information that
          I might overlook if I started with a blank piece of paper.</p><p class="calibre3">I don’t fill out a template from top to bottom. Instead, I
          populate the various sections as I accumulate information during the
          course of the project. Empty sections highlight gaps in our current
          knowledge. Suppose one section of my document template is titled
          “Business risks.” Partway through the project, I realize this
          section is empty. Does the project really have no business risks?
          Have we identified some business risks but stored them someplace
          else? Or have we not yet worked with appropriate stakeholders to
          identify possible risks? Blank sections in the template help me
          conduct a richer exploration for important project information. If
          there are common questions you ask to elicit content for a section,
          consider embedding those in the appropriate section of the template,
          perhaps in the form of hidden text, for others to reuse.</p><p class="calibre3">I use the term “shrink to fit” when working with templates. I
          begin with a rich template with many categories that might be
          important. Then I condense it down to just what I need for each
          situation. Suppose that a certain section of the template&mdash;business
          risks, say&mdash;doesn’t pertain to the current project. I can remove that
          section from my document or I can retain the heading but leave the
          contents blank. Both options run the risk that a reader will notice
          the hole and question whether there are indeed any business risks.
          The best solution is to put an explicit message in that section: “No
          business risks have been identified.”</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-711" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-731" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-732" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2528" class="calibre"></a>If certain sections of a template rarely get used,
          delete them. You might want to create a small set of templates for
          use on different types of projects, such as SRS templates suitable
          for use on large, new development projects; small websites; and
          enhancement projects. Even if you store your requirements in some
          repository other than a traditional document, a template can help
          you consider all the requirements information you need to accumulate
          for your project.</p><p class="calibre3">One project manager described the benefits his team received
          from adopting requirements document templates: “They are time
          consuming to fill in. The first couple of times I created them, I
          was surprised at the amount of detail required to make them useful,
          and then the amount of work taken to review and tidy up the
          documents, cleaning up any ambiguities, filling in gaps, etc.
          <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">But</em></span> it’s worth it. The first two products that

            problem or exploit an opportunity. A business objectives model
            shows a hierarchy of related business problems and measurable
            business objectives (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-42">[ref013]</a>). The problems
            describe what is keeping the business from meeting their goals at
            present, whereas the objectives define ways to measure achievement
            of those goals. Problems and objectives are intertwined:
            understanding one can reveal the other.</p><p class="calibre3">Given a set of business objectives, ask, “What is keeping us
            from achieving the goal?” to identify a more detailed business
            problem. Or work backward by asking, “Why do we care about that
            goal?” to better understand the top-level business problem or
            opportunity. Given a business problem, ask, “How will we assess
            whether the problem is solved?” to identify the measurable
            objective. The process is iterative, cycling through the hierarchy
            of problems and objectives until you see a list of features emerge
            that would help solve the problems and meet the objectives.</p><p class="calibre3">A conversation between a business analyst and an executive
            sponsor to identify business problems and objectives might look

            illustration is for the Chemical Tracking System project at

            after a project is complete. In other cases, achieving the
            business objectives might be dependent on projects beyond your
            current one. However, it’s still important to evaluate the success
            of an individual project. Success metrics indicate whether a
            project is on track to meet its business objectives. The metrics
            can be tracked during testing or shortly after product release.
            For the Chemical Tracking System, one success metric might be the
            same as Business Objective 3 in <a class="xref" title="Figure 5-5. Example business objectives model for the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-119">Figure&nbsp;5-5</a> to “Reduce
            time spent ordering chemicals to 10 minutes on 80 percent of
            orders,” because you can measure the average order time during
            testing or soon after release. Another success metric might relate
            to Business Objective 2 with a timeline that can be measured much
            earlier than a year after release, such as “Track 60 percent of
            commercial chemical containers and 50 percent of proprietary
            chemicals within 4 weeks.”</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-119" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2733" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000017.jpeg" alt="The figure contains several boxes connected by                   arrows.

              longtime client and I work together very well, but occasionally
              Bill asks me to undertake a new project that’s a little
              different. If we aren’t exactly sure what he wants me to do, I
              ask him to write a vision statement. Bill always grumbles a bit
              because he knows that this will force him to think carefully
              about exactly what outcome he is expecting. But Bill’s vision
              statement invariably gives me a clear idea of just what we are
              trying to accomplish so we can work efficiently together. It’s
              well worth the time it takes.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-626" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-728" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-733" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-741" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-749" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-992" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2049" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2536" class="calibre"></a>You might have several key stakeholders write
              their vision statements separately, rather than doing it as a
              group exercise. Comparing their vision statements is a good way
              to spot different understandings about the project’s objectives.
              And it’s never too late to write a vision statement. Even if the
              project is under way, crafting a vision statement can help keep
              the rest of the project work on track and in focus. Though
              drafting a vision statement is quick, crafting the
              <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">right</em></span> vision statement and reaching

            believed to be true in the absence of proof or definitive
            knowledge. Business assumptions are specifically related to the
            business requirements. Incorrect assumptions can potentially keep
            you from meeting your business objectives. For example, an
            executive sponsor might set a business objective that a new
            website will increase revenue by $100,000 per month. To establish
            this revenue target, the sponsor made some assumptions, perhaps
            that the new site will attract 200 additional unique visitors per
            day and that each visitor will spend an average of $17. If the new
            site does not attract enough visitors with a high enough average
            sale per visitor, the project might not achieve its business
            objective. If you learn that certain assumptions are wrong, you
            might have to change scope, adjust the schedule, or launch other
            projects to achieve the objectives.</p><p class="calibre3">Record any assumptions that the stakeholders made when
            conceiving the project and writing their vision and scope
            document. Often, one party’s assumptions are not shared by others.
            If you write them down and review them, you can avoid possible
            confusion and aggravation in the future.</p><p class="calibre3">Record any major dependencies the project has on external
            factors. Examples are pending industry standards or government
            regulations, deliverables from other projects, third-party
            suppliers, or development partners. Some business assumptions and
            dependencies might turn into risks that the project manager must
            monitor regularly. Broken dependencies are a common source of
            project delays. Note the impact of an assumption not being true,
            or the impact of a broken dependency, to help stakeholders
            understand why it is critical.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="2.

Scope and limitations</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">When a chemist invents a new reaction that transforms one kind
          of chemical into another, he writes a paper that includes a <a class="xref" title="2. Scope and limitations" href="#calibre_link-121">2. Scope and limitations</a> section, which describes what
          the reaction will and will not do. Similarly, a software project
          should define its scope and limitations. You need to state both what
          the solution being developed <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">is</em></span> and what it
          <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">is not</em></span>.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-726" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1021" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1248" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1378" class="calibre"></a>Many projects suffer from scope creep&mdash;rampant growth
          as more and more functionality gets stuffed into the product. The
          first step to controlling scope creep is to define the project’s
          scope. The scope describes the concept and range of the proposed
          solution. The limitations itemize certain capabilities that the
          product will <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">not</em></span> include that some people might
          assume will be there. The scope and limitations help to establish
          realistic stakeholder expectations because customers sometimes
          request features that are too expensive or that lie outside the
          intended project scope.</p><p class="calibre3">Scope can be represented in numerous ways (see “Scope
          representation techniques” later in this chapter). At the highest
          level, scope is defined when the customer decides which business
          objectives to target. At a lower level, scope is defined at the
          level of features, user stories, use cases, or events and responses
          to include. Scope ultimately is defined through the set of
          functional requirements planned for implementation in a specific
          release or iteration. At each level, the scope must stay within the
          bounds of the level above it. For example, in-scope user
          requirements must map to the business objectives, and functional
          requirements must map to user requirements that are in scope.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2739" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Blue-sky requirements</div><p class="calibre3">A manager at a product development company that suffered
            near-catastrophic scope creep once told me ruefully, “We
            blue-skied the requirements too much.” She meant that any idea
            anyone had was included in the requirements. This company had a
            solid product vision, but they didn’t manage the scope by planning
            a series of releases and deferring some suggested features to
            later (perhaps infinitely later) releases. The team finally
            released an overinflated product after four years of development.
            It can be valuable to jot down the blue-sky requirements for
            future consideration. However, thoughtful scope management and an
            incremental development approach would have let the team ship a
            useful product much earlier.</p></div><div class="book" title="2.1 Major features"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2740">2.1 Major features</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">List the product’s major features or user capabilities,
            emphasizing those that distinguish it from previous or competing

            that the list is complete and that it does not include unnecessary
            features that sound interesting but don’t provide customer value.
            Give each feature a unique and persistent label to permit tracing
            it to other system elements. You might include a feature tree
            diagram, as described later in this chapter.</p></div><div class="book" title="2.2 Scope of initial release"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2741">2.2 Scope of initial release</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Summarize the capabilities that are planned for inclusion in

            quality characteristics that will let the product provide the
            intended benefits to its various user classes. To focus the
            development effort and maintain a reasonable project schedule,
            avoid the temptation to include every feature that any potential
            customer might eventually want in release 1.0. Bloatware and
            slipped schedules are common outcomes of such insidious scope
            stuffing. Focus on those features that will provide the most
            value, at the most acceptable cost, to the broadest community, in
            the earliest time frame.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-700" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-729" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1609" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2178" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2527" class="calibre"></a>As an illustration, a recent project team decided
            that users had to be able to run their package delivery business
            with the first release of the software application. Version 1
            didn’t have to be fast, pretty, or easy to use, but it had to be
            reliable; this focus drove everything the team did. The initial
            release accomplished the basic objectives of the system. Future
            releases will include additional features, options, and usability
            aids. Be careful not to neglect nonfunctional requirements in the
            initial release, though. The ones that directly affect
            architecture are particularly critical to establish from the
            outset. Rearchitecting to try to fix quality deficiencies can be
            almost as expensive as a total rewrite. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 14. Beyond functionality" href="#calibre_link-40">Chapter&nbsp;14</a> for more about software quality

            release roadmap that indicates which functionality chunks will be
            deferred and the desired timing of later releases. Subsequent
            releases let you implement additional use cases and features, as
            well as enriching the capabilities of the initial ones. The
            farther out you look, the fuzzier these future scope statements
            will be and the more they will change over time. Expect to shift
            functionality from one planned release to another and to add
            unanticipated capabilities. Short release cycles provide frequent

            agree on the project’s priorities. One way to approach this is to
            consider the five dimensions of features, quality, schedule, cost,
            and staff (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-66">[ref240]</a>). Each dimension fits in one
            of the following three categories on any given project:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p title="Constraint" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Constraint</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;A limiting factor within which the project manager

                  freedom</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;A factor that the project manager has some latitude to
                  adjust and balance against the other dimensions</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">The project manager’s challenge is to adjust the degrees of
            freedom to achieve the project’s success drivers within the limits
            imposed by the constraints. Suppose marketing suddenly demands
            that you release the product one month earlier than scheduled. How
            do you respond? Do you:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Defer certain requirements to a later release?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Shorten the planned system test cycle?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Demand overtime from your staff or hire contractors to
                accelerate development?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Shift resources from other projects to help out?</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">The project priorities drive the actions you take when such
            eventualities arise. Realistically, when change happens, you need
            to have conversations with the key stakeholders to determine the
            most appropriate actions to take based on the change requested.
            For example, marketing might want to add features or shorten a
            timeline, but perhaps they are willing to defer certain features
            in exchange. See <a class="xref" title="Appendix D. Sample requirements documents" href="#calibre_link-116">Appendix&nbsp;D</a>
            for an example of how to document these project priorities.</p><div class="note" title="Important"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-2747" class="calibre"></a>Important</h3><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-743" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-892" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-997" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1197" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1202" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1269" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1512" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1547" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1778" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2102" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2277" class="calibre"></a>Not all of the five dimensions can be constraints,
              and they cannot all be drivers. The project manager needs some

        or stored elsewhere and referenced as needed.</p><p class="calibre3">The purpose of tools such as the context diagram, ecosystem map,

        communication among the project stakeholders. That clarity is more
        important than dogmatically adhering to the rules for a “correct”
        diagram. We strongly recommend, though, that you adopt the notations
        illustrated in the following examples as standards for drawing the
        diagrams. For example, in a context diagram, suppose you were to use a
        triangle to represent the system instead of a circle, and ovals rather
        than rectangles for external entities. Your colleagues would have
        difficulty reading a diagram that follows your personal preferences
        rather than a team standard.</p><p class="calibre3">Context diagrams, ecosystem maps, feature trees, and event lists
        are the most common ways to represent scope visually. However, other
        techniques are also used. Identifying affected business processes also
        can help define the scope boundary. Use case diagrams can depict the

          and human components. Therefore, it could include manual operations
          as part of the entire system. The external entities in the

          an ideal model to show to executives who want a quick glance at the

          You could implement a feature in its entirety in a specific release,
          or you could implement only a portion of it by choosing just certain
          L2 and L3 subfeatures. Future releases could enrich these
          rudimentary implementations by adding more L2 and L3 subfeatures
          until each feature is fully implemented in the final product. So the
          scope of a particular release consists of a defined set of L1, L2,
          and/or L3 features chosen from the feature tree. You can mark up a
          feature tree diagram to illustrate these feature allocations across
          releases by using colors or font variations. Alternatively, you can

          business events triggered by users, time-triggered (temporal)
          events, or signal events received from external components, such as
          hardware devices. The event list only names the events; the

          the “Time to” do something arrives), as well as identifying the
          event action. An event list is a useful scoping tool because you can
          allocate certain events to be implemented in specific product

          describe the external actors and systems involved, whereas the event
          list identifies what those actors and systems might do to trigger
          behavior in the system being specified. You can check the event list
          against the context diagram and ecosystem map for correctness and
          completeness, as follows:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Consider whether each external entity on the context
              diagram is the source of any events: “Do any actions by Chemists

              events for your system.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">For each event, consider whether you have corresponding

              ecosystem map?”</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">If you find a disconnect, consider whether the model is
          missing an element. In this case, Vendor did not appear on the

          interface directly to vendors. However, Vendor is included in the

        The business requirements and an understanding of how customers will
        use the product provide valuable tools for dealing with scope change.
        Scope change isn’t a bad thing if it helps you steer the project
        toward satisfying evolving customer needs. The information in the
        vision and scope document lets you assess whether proposed
        requirements are appropriate for inclusion in the project. You can
        modify the scope for a future iteration or for an entire project if
        it’s done consciously, by the right people, for the right business
        reasons, and with understanding and acceptance of the
        tradeoffs.</p><p class="calibre3">Remember, whenever someone requests a new requirement, the
        analyst needs to ask, “Is this in scope?” One response might be that
        the proposed requirement is clearly out of scope. Perhaps it’s
        interesting, but it should be addressed in a future release or by
        another project. Another possibility is that the request obviously
        lies within the defined project scope. You can incorporate new
        in-scope requirements in the current project if they are of high
        priority relative to the other requirements that were already
        committed. Including new requirements often involves making a decision
        to defer or cancel other planned requirements, unless you’re willing
        to extend the project’s duration.</p><p class="calibre3">The third possibility is that the proposed new requirement is
        out of scope, but it’s such a good idea that the scope should be
        broadened to accommodate it, with corresponding changes in budget,
        schedule, and/or staff. That is, there’s a feedback loop between the
        user requirements and the business requirements. This will require
        that you update the vision and scope document, which should have been
        placed under change control at the time it was baselined. Keep a
        record of why requirements were rejected; they have a way of
        reappearing. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 27. Requirements management practices" href="#calibre_link-89">Chapter&nbsp;27</a>
        describes how to use a requirement attribute to track rejected or
        deferred requirements.</p><div class="book" title="Using business objectives to make scoping decisions"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2759">Using business objectives to make scoping decisions</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The business objectives are the most important factor to
          consider when making scope decisions. Determine which proposed
          features or user requirements add the most value with respect to the
          business objectives; schedule those for the early releases. When a
          stakeholder wants to add functionality, consider how the suggested
          changes will contribute to achieving the business objectives. For
          example, a business objective to generate maximum revenue from a
          kiosk implies the early implementation of features that sell more
          products or services to the customer. Glitzy features that appeal to
          only a few technology-hungry customers and don’t contribute to the
          primary business objective shouldn’t have high priority.</p><p class="calibre3">If possible, quantify the contribution the feature makes
          towards the business objectives, so that people can make scoping
          decisions on the basis of facts rather than emotions (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-42">[ref013]</a>). Will a specific feature contribute roughly
          $1,000, $100,000, or $1,000,000 toward a business objective? When an
          executive requests a new feature that he thought of over the
          weekend, you can use quantitative analysis to help determine if
          adding it is the right business decision.</p></div><div class="book" title="Assessing the impact of scope changes"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2760">Assessing the impact of scope changes</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-598" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-727" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2761" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2762" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2763" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2764" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1458" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2765" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2308" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2526" class="calibre"></a>When the project’s scope increases, the project
          manager usually will have to renegotiate the planned budget,
          resources, schedule, and/or staff. Ideally, the original schedule
          and resources will accommodate a certain amount of change because of
          thoughtfully included contingency buffers (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-57">[ref248]</a>). Otherwise, you’ll need to re-plan after
          requirements changes are approved.</p><p class="calibre3">A common consequence of scope change is that completed
          activities must be reworked in response to the changes. Quality
          often suffers if the allocated resources or time are not increased
          when new functionality is added. Documented business requirements
          make it easier to manage legitimate scope growth as the marketplace
          or business needs change. They also help a harried project manager
          to justify saying “no”&mdash;or at least “not yet”&mdash;when influential people
          try to stuff more features into an overly constrained
          project.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Vision and scope on agile projects"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2766">Vision and scope on agile projects</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Managing scope on an agile project, in which development is
        performed in a series of fixed timebox iterations, takes a different
        approach. The scope of each iteration consists of user stories
        selected from a dynamic product backlog, based on their relative
        priority and the estimated delivery capacity of the team for each
        timebox. Instead of trying to fight scope creep, the team prioritizes
        new requirements against existing items in the backlog and allocates
        them to future iterations. The number of iterations&mdash;and hence the
        overall project duration&mdash;still depends on the total amount of
        functionality to be implemented, but the scope of each iteration is
        controlled to ensure timely completion. Alternatively, some agile
        projects fix the overall project duration, yet are willing to modify
        the scope. The number of iterations might remain the same, but the
        scope addressed in remaining iterations changes according to the
        relative priorities of existing and newly defined user stories.</p><p class="calibre3">The team can define a high-level roadmap of iterations at the
        beginning of the project, but the user story allocation for an
        iteration will be performed at the beginning of each iteration.
        Referencing the business requirements as the team sets the scope for
        each iteration helps to ensure that the project delivers a product
        that meets the business objectives. The same strategy can be used on
        any project that follows a timeboxed development process (see the
        “Scope management and timeboxed development” sidebar).</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2767" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Scope management and timeboxed development</div><p class="calibre3">Enrique, a project manager at Litware, Inc., had to deliver a
          web-enabled version of Litware’s flagship portfolio-management
          software. It would take about two years to fully supplant the mature
          application, but Litware needed a web presence right away. Enrique
          selected a timeboxed development approach, promising to release a
          new version every 90 days. His marketing team carefully prioritized
          the product’s requirements. The SRS for each quarterly release
          included a committed set of new and enhanced features, as well as a
          list of lower-priority “stretch” requirements to be implemented as
          time permitted. Enrique’s team didn’t incorporate every stretch
          requirement into each release, but they did ship a stable release
          every three months through this schedule-driven approach to scope
          management. Schedule and quality are normally constraints on a
          timeboxed project, and scope is a degree of freedom.</p></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-739" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1592" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1758" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2081" class="calibre"></a>Although agile projects might not create a formal vision

        relevant and essential to delivering a successful product. Many agile

        deliver the most business value in the earliest iterations. Success
        metrics should be defined so that as iterative releases go live, the
        success can be measured and the rest of the backlog adjusted
        accordingly. A vision statement describes the long-term plan for what

        Traditionally, a project manager manages the project towards
        completion. However, a business analyst is intimately familiar with
        the business objectives and can help determine when the desired value
        has been delivered, implying that the work is done.</p><p class="calibre3">If you begin with a clear vision for the solution, and if each
        release or iteration is scoped to deliver just a portion of the total
        functionality, then you will be done when you complete the preplanned
        iterations. The completed iterations should have led to a fully
        realized product vision that meets the business objectives.</p><p class="calibre3">However, particularly in iterative development approaches, the
        end point might be vague. Within each iteration, scope is defined for
        that iteration. As the project continues, the backlog of uncompleted
        work dwindles. It’s not always necessary to implement the entire set
        of remaining functionality. It’s critical to have clear business
        objectives so that you can move toward satisfying those objectives
        incrementally as information becomes available. The project is
        complete when the success metrics indicate that you have a good chance
        of meeting the business objectives. Vague business objectives will
        guarantee an open-ended project with no way to know when you’re done.
        Funding sponsors don’t like it because they don’t know how to budget,
        schedule, or plan for such projects. Customers don’t like it because
        they might receive a solution that is delivered on time and on budget
        but that doesn’t provide the value they need. But that might just be
        the risk of working on products that cannot be clearly defined at the
        outset, unless you refine the business objectives partway through the
        project.</p><p class="calibre3">Focus on defining clear business requirements for all of your

      the director of the Drug Discovery Division at Contoso Pharmaceuticals.
      Ruth had asked the information technology team that supported Contoso’s
      research organization to build a new application to help the research
      chemists accelerate their exploration for new drugs. Jeremy was assigned
      as the business analyst for the project. After introducing himself and
      discussing the project in broad terms, Jeremy said to Ruth, “I’d like to
      talk with some of your chemists to understand their requirements for the
      system. Who might be some good people to start with?”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Ruth replied, “I did that same job for five years before
      I became the division director three years ago. You don’t really need to
      talk to any of my people; I can tell you everything you need to know
      about this project.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Jeremy was concerned. Scientific knowledge and
      technologies change quickly, so he wasn’t sure if Ruth could adequately
      represent the current and future needs for users of this complex
      application. Perhaps there were some internal politics going on that
      weren’t apparent and there was a good reason for Ruth to create a buffer
      between Jeremy and the actual users. After some discussion, though, it
      became clear that Ruth didn’t want any of her people involved directly
      with the project.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“Okay,” Jeremy agreed reluctantly. “Maybe I can start by
      doing some document analysis and bring questions I have to you. Can we
      set up a series of interviews for the next couple of weeks so I can
      understand the kinds of things you expect your scientists to be able to
      do with this new system?”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“Sorry, I’m swamped right now,” Ruth told him. “I can
      give you a couple of hours in about three weeks to clarify things you’re
      unsure about. Just go ahead and start writing the requirements. When we
      meet, then you can ask me any questions you still have. I hope that will
      let you get the ball rolling on this project.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">If you share our conviction that customer involvement is a
      critical factor in delivering excellent software, you will ensure that
      the business analyst (BA) and project manager for your project will work
      hard to engage appropriate customer representatives from the outset.
      Success in software requirements, and hence in software development,
      depends on getting the voice of the user close to the ear of the
      developer. To find the voice of the user, take the following
      steps:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Identify the different classes of users for your
          product.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Select and work with individuals who represent each user class

      expectation gap described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 2. Requirements from the customer’s perspective" href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter&nbsp;2</a> a mismatch between
      the product that customers expect to receive and what developers build.
      It’s not enough simply to ask a few customers or their manager what they
      want once or twice and then start coding. If developers build exactly
      what customers initially request, they’ll probably have to build it
      again because customers often don’t know what they really need. In
      addition, the BAs might not be talking to the right people or asking the
      right questions.</p><p class="calibre3">The features that users present as their “wants” don’t necessarily
      equate to the functionality they need to perform their tasks with the
      new product. To gain a more accurate view of user needs, the business
      analyst must collect a wide range of user input, analyze and clarify it,
      and specify just what needs to be built to let users do their jobs. The
      BA has the lead responsibility for recording the new system’s necessary
      capabilities and properties and for communicating that information to
      other stakeholders. This is an iterative process that takes time. If you
      don’t invest the time to achieve this shared understanding&mdash;this common
      vision of the intended product&mdash;the certain outcomes are rework, missed
      deadlines, cost overruns, and customer dissatisfaction.</p><div class="book" title="User classes"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2771">User classes</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">People often talk about “the user” for a software system as
        though all users belong to a monolithic group with similar
        characteristics and needs. In reality, most products of any size
        appeal to a diversity of users with different expectations and goals.
        Rather than thinking of “the user” in singular, spend some time
        identifying the multiple user classes and their roles and privileges
        for your product.</p><div class="book" title="Classifying users"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2772">Classifying users</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Chapter 2. Requirements from the customer’s perspective" href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>

          have. As shown in <a class="xref" title="Figure 6-1. A hierarchy of stakeholders, customers, users, and user classes." href="#calibre_link-130">Figure&nbsp;6-1</a>, a user class
          is a subset of the product’s users, which is a subset of the
          product’s customers, which is a subset of its stakeholders. An
          individual can belong to multiple user classes. For example, an
          application’s administrator might also interact with it as an
          ordinary user at times. A product’s users might differ&mdash;among other
          ways&mdash;in the following respects, and you can group users into a
          number of distinct <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">user classes</em></span> based on these
          sorts of differences:</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-130" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2773" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000022.jpeg" alt="Illustration showing a hierarchy.

          their geographical location or the kind of company they work in. One
          company that creates software used in the banking industry initially
          considered distinguishing users based on whether they worked in a
          large commercial bank, a small commercial bank, a savings and loan
          institution, or a credit union. These distinctions really represent
          different market segments, though, not different user
          classes.</p><p class="calibre3">A better way to identify user classes is to think about the
          tasks that various users will perform with the system. All of those
          types of financial institutions will have tellers, employees who
          process loan applications, business bankers, and so forth. The
          individuals who perform such activities&mdash;whether they are job titles
          or simply roles&mdash;will have similar functional needs for the system
          across all of the financial institutions. Tellers all have to do
          more or less the same things, business bankers do more or less the
          same things, and so on. More logical user class names for a banking
          system therefore might include teller, loan officer, business
          banker, and branch manager. You might discover additional user
          classes by thinking of possible use cases, user stories, and process
          flows and who might perform them.</p><p class="calibre3">Certain user classes could be more important than others for a
          specific project. Favored user classes are those whose satisfaction
          is most closely aligned with achieving the project’s business
          objectives. When resolving conflicts between requirements from
          different user classes or making priority decisions, favored user
          classes receive preferential treatment. This doesn’t mean that the
          customers who are paying for the system (who might not be users at
          all) or those who have the most political clout should necessarily
          be favored. It’s a matter of alignment with the business
          objectives.</p><p class="calibre3">Disfavored user classes are groups who aren’t supposed to use
          the product for legal, security, or safety reasons (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-131">[ref081]</a>). You might build in features to deliberately
          make it hard for disfavored users to do things they aren’t supposed
          to do. Examples include access security mechanisms, user privilege
          levels, antimalware features (for non-human users), and usage
          logging. Locking a user’s account after four unsuccessful login
          attempts protects against access by the disfavored user class of
          “user impersonators,” albeit at the risk of inconveniencing
          forgetful legitimate users. If my bank doesn’t recognize the
          computer I’m using, it sends me an email message with a one-time
          access code I have to enter before I can log on. This feature was
          implemented because of the disfavored user class of “people who
          might have stolen my banking information.”</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2774" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1571" class="calibre"></a>You might elect to ignore still other user classes.
          Yes, they will use the product, but you don’t specifically build it
          to suit them. If there are any other groups of users that are
          neither favored, disfavored, nor ignored, they are of equal
          importance in defining the product’s requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">Each user class will have its own set of requirements for the
          tasks that members of the class must perform. There could be some
          overlap between the needs of different user classes. Tellers,
          business bankers, and loan officers all might have to check a bank
          customer’s account balance, for instance. Different user classes
          also could have different quality expectations, such as usability,
          that will drive user interface design choices. New or occasional
          users are concerned with how easy the system is to learn. Such users
          like menus, graphical user interfaces, uncluttered screen displays,
          wizards, and help screens. As users gain experience with the system,
          they become more interested in efficiency. They now value keyboard
          shortcuts, customization options, toolbars, and scripting
          facilities.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-2775" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Don’t overlook indirect user classes. They won’t use your
            application themselves, instead accessing its data or services
            through other applications or through reports. Your customer once
            removed is still your customer.</p></div><p class="calibre3">User classes need not be human beings. They could be software
          agents performing a service on behalf of a human user, such as bots.
          Software agents can scan networks for information about goods and
          services, assemble custom news feeds, process your incoming email,
          monitor physical systems and networks for problems or intrusions, or
          perform data mining. Internet agents that probe websites for
          vulnerabilities or to generate spam are a type of disfavored
          non-human user class. If you identify these sorts of disfavored user
          classes, you might specify certain requirements not to meet their
          needs but rather to thwart them. For instance, website tools such as
          CAPTCHA that validate whether a user is a human being attempt to
          block such disruptive access by “users” you want to keep out.</p><p class="calibre3">Remember, users are a subset of customers, which are a subset
          of stakeholders. You’ll need to consider a much broader range of
          potential sources of requirements than just direct and indirect user
          classes. For instance, even though the development team members
          aren’t end users of the system they’re building, you need their
          input on internal quality attributes such as efficiency,
          modifiability, portability, and reusability, as described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 14. Beyond functionality" href="#calibre_link-40">Chapter&nbsp;14</a>. One company found that every
          installation of their product was an expensive nightmare until they
          introduced an “installer” user class so they could focus on
          requirements such as the development of a customization architecture
          for their product. Look well beyond the obvious end users when
          you’re trying to identify stakeholders whose requirements input is
          necessary.</p></div><div class="book" title="Identifying your user classes"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2776">Identifying your user classes</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1311" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1343" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1603" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2485" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2553" class="calibre"></a>Identify and characterize the different user classes
          for your product early in the project so you can elicit requirements
          from representatives of each important class. A useful technique for
          this is a collaboration pattern developed by Ellen Gottesdiener
          called “expand then contract” (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-83">[ref093]</a>). Start by
          asking the project sponsor who he expects to use the system. Then
          brainstorm as many user classes as you can think of. Don’t get
          nervous if there are dozens at this stage; you’ll condense and
          categorize them later. It’s important not to overlook a user class,
          which can lead to problems later when someone complains that the
          delivered solution doesn’t meet her needs. Next, look for groups
          with similar needs that you can either combine or treat as a major
          user class with several subclasses. Try to pare the list down to
          about 15 or fewer distinct user classes.</p><p class="calibre3">One company that developed a specialized product for about 65
          corporate customers initially regarded each company as a distinct
          user with unique needs. Grouping their customers into just six user
          classes greatly simplified their requirements challenges. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-70">[ref082]</a> offer much advice about casting a wide net to
          identify potential users, pruning the user list, and seeking
          specific users to participate in the project.</p><p class="calibre3">Various analysis models can help you identify user classes.
          The external entities shown outside your system on a context diagram
          (see <a class="xref" title="Chapter 5. Establishing the business requirements" href="#calibre_link-32">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>) are
          candidates for user classes. A corporate organization chart can also
          help you discover potential users and other stakeholders (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-42">[ref013]</a>). <a class="xref" title="Figure 6-2. A portion of the organization chart for Contoso Pharmaceuticals." href="#calibre_link-132">Figure&nbsp;6-2</a> illustrates a

          Nearly all of the potential users for the system are likely to be

          analysis, study the organization chart to look for:</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-132" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2777" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000023.jpeg" alt="Illustration showing an organization chart.

          will overlook an important class of users within that organization.
          It shows you where to seek potential representatives for specific
          user classes, as well as helping determine who the key requirements
          decision makers might be. You might find multiple user classes with
          diverse needs within a single department. Conversely, recognizing
          the same user class in multiple departments can simplify
          requirements elicitation. Studying the organization chart helps you
          judge how many user representatives you’ll need to work with to feel
          confident that you thoroughly understand the broad user community’s
          needs. Also try to understand what type of information the users
          from each department might supply based on their role in the
          organization and their department’s perspective on the
          project.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2159" class="calibre"></a>Document the user classes and their characteristics,
          responsibilities, and physical locations in the software
          requirements specification (SRS) or in a requirements plan for your
          project. Check that information against any information you might
          already have about stakeholder profiles in the vision and scope
          document to avoid conflicts and duplication. Include all pertinent
          information you have about each user class, such as its relative or
          absolute size and which classes are favored. This will help the team

          across multiple applications. Defining user classes at the
          enterprise level lets you reuse those user class descriptions in
          future projects. The next system you build might serve the needs of
          some new user classes, but it probably will also be used by user
          classes from your earlier systems. If you do include the user-class
          descriptions in the project’s SRS, you can incorporate entries from
          the reusable user-class catalog by reference and just write
          descriptions of any new groups that are specific to that
          application.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="User personas"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2778">User personas</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">To help bring your user classes to life, consider creating a
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">persona</em></span> for each one, a description of a
        representative member of the user class (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-134">[ref050]</a>;
        <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-93">[ref157]</a>). A persona is a description of a
        hypothetical, generic person who serves as a stand-in for a group of
        users having similar characteristics and needs. You can use personas
        to help you understand the requirements and to design the user
        experience to best meet the needs of specific user communities.</p><p class="calibre3">A persona can serve as a placeholder when the BA doesn’t have an
        actual user representative at hand. Rather than having progress come
        to a halt, the BA can envision a persona performing a particular task
        or try to assess what the persona’s preferences would be, thereby
        drafting a requirements starting point to be confirmed when an actual
        user is available. Persona details for a commercial customer include
        social and demographic characteristics and behaviors, preferences,
        annoyances, and similar information. Make sure the personas you create
        truly are representative of their user class, based on market,
        demographic, and ethnographic research.</p><p class="calibre3">Here’s an example of a persona for one user class on the
        Chemical Tracking System:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Fred, 41, has been a chemist at Contoso
          Pharmaceuticals since he received his Ph.D. 14 years ago. He doesn’t
          have much patience with computers. Fred usually works on two
          projects at a time in related chemical areas. His lab contains
          approximately 300 bottles of chemicals and gas cylinders. On an
          average day, he’ll need four new chemicals from the stockroom. Two
          of these will be commercial chemicals in stock, one will need to be
          ordered, and one will come from the supply of proprietary Contoso
          chemical samples. On occasion, Fred will need a hazardous chemical
          that requires special training for safe handling. When he buys a
          chemical for the first time, Fred wants the material safety data
          sheet emailed to him automatically. Each year, Fred will synthesize
          about 20 new proprietary chemicals to go into the stockroom. Fred
          wants a report of his chemical usage for the previous month to be
          generated automatically and sent to him by email so that he can
          monitor his chemical exposure.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">As the business analyst explores the chemists’ requirements, he
        can think about Fred as the archetype of this user class and ask
        himself, “What would Fred need to do?” Working with a persona makes
        the requirements thought process more tangible than if you simply
        contemplate what a whole faceless group of people might want. Some
        people choose a random human face of the appropriate gender to make a
        persona seem even more real.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-853" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-862" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1272" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2488" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2546" class="calibre"></a><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-93">[ref157]</a> suggests that you design the
        system to make it easy for the individual described in your persona to
        use the application. That is, you focus on meeting that one
        (imaginary) person’s needs. Provided you’ve created a persona that
        accurately represents the user class, this should help you do a good
        job of satisfying the needs and expectations of the whole class. As
        one colleague related, “On a project for servicing coin-operated
        vending machines, I introduced Dolly the Serviceperson and Ralph the
        Warehouse Supervisor. We wrote scenarios for them and they became part
        of the project team&mdash;virtually.”</p></div><div class="book" title="Connecting with user representatives"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2779">Connecting with user representatives</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Every kind of project&mdash;corporate information systems, commercial
        applications, embedded systems, websites, contracted software&mdash;needs
        suitable representatives to provide the voice of the user. These users
        should be involved throughout the development life cycle, not just in
        an isolated requirements phase at the beginning of the project. Each
        user class needs someone to speak for it.</p><p class="calibre3">It’s easiest to gain access to actual users when you’re
        developing applications for deployment within your own company. If
        you’re developing commercial software, you might engage people from
        your beta-testing or early-release sites to provide requirements input
        much earlier in the development process. (See the “External product
        champions” section later in this chapter). Consider setting up focus
        groups of current users of your products or your competitors’
        products. Instead of just guessing at what your users might want, ask
        some of them.</p><p class="calibre3">One company asked a focus group to perform certain tasks with
        various digital cameras and computers. The results indicated that the
        company’s camera software took too long to perform the most common
        operation because of a design decision that was made to accommodate
        less likely scenarios as well. The company changed their next camera
        to reduce customer complaints about speed.</p><p class="calibre3">Be sure that the focus group represents the kinds of users whose
        needs should drive your product development. Include both expert and
        less experienced customers. If your focus group represents only early
        adopters or blue-sky thinkers, you might end up with many
        sophisticated and technically difficult requirements that few
        customers find useful.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 6-3. Some possible communication pathways between the user and the developer." href="#calibre_link-135">Figure&nbsp;6-3</a>
        illustrates some typical communication pathways that connect the voice
        of the user to the ear of the developer. One study indicated that
        employing more kinds of communication links and more direct links
        between developers and users led to more successful projects (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-136">[ref137]</a>). The most direct communication occurs when
        developers can talk to appropriate users themselves, which means that
        the developer is also performing the business analyst role. This can
        work on very small projects, provided the developer involved has the
        appropriate BA skills, but it doesn’t scale up to large projects with
        thousands of potential users and dozens of developers.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-135" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2780" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000024.jpeg" alt="Illustration showing several kinds of arrows connecting               the user in a box at the far left to the developer in a box at               the far right.

        layers between the user and the developer increase the chance of
        miscommunication and delay transmission. Some of these intervening
        layers add value, though, as when a skilled BA works with users or
        other participants to collect, evaluate, refine, and organize their
        input. Recognize the risks that you assume by using marketing staff,
        product managers, subject matter experts, or others as surrogates for
        the actual voice of the user. Despite the obstacles to&mdash;and the cost
        of&mdash;optimizing user representation, your product and your customers
        will suffer if you don’t talk to the people who can provide the best
        information.</p></div><div class="book" title="The product champion"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2781">The product champion</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Many years ago I worked in a small software development group
        that supported the scientific research activities at a major
        corporation. Each of our projects included a few key members of our
        user community to provide the requirements. We called these people
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">product champions</em></span> (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-66">[ref240]</a>).
        The product champion approach provides an effective way to structure
        that all-important customer-development collaborative partnership
        discussed in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 2. Requirements from the customer’s perspective" href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2218" class="calibre"></a>Each product champion serves as the primary interface
        between members of a single user class and the project’s business
        analyst. Ideally, the champions will be actual users, not surrogates
        such as funding sponsors, marketing staff, user managers, or software
        developers imagining themselves to be users. Product champions gather
        requirements from other members of the user classes they represent and
        reconcile inconsistencies. Requirements development is thus a shared
        responsibility of the BA and selected users, although the BA should
        actually write the requirements documents. It’s hard enough to write
        good requirements if you do it for a living; it is not realistic to
        expect users who have never written requirements before to do a good
        job.</p><p class="calibre3">The best product champions have a clear vision of the new
        system. They’re enthusiastic because they see how it will benefit them
        and their peers. Champions should be effective communicators who are
        respected by their colleagues. They need a thorough understanding of
        the application domain and the solution’s operating environment. Great
        product champions are in demand for other assignments, so you’ll have
        to build a persuasive case for why particular individuals are critical
        to project success. For example, product champions can lead adoption
        of the application by the user community, which might be a success
        metric that managers will appreciate. We have found that good product
        champions made a huge difference in our projects, so we offer them
        public reward and recognition for their contributions.</p><p class="calibre3">Our software development teams enjoyed an additional benefit
        from the product champion approach. On several projects, we had
        excellent champions who spoke out on our behalf with their colleagues
        when the customers wondered why the software wasn’t done yet. “Don’t
        worry about it,” the champions told their peers and their managers. “I
        understand and agree with the software team’s approach to software
        engineering. The time we’re spending on requirements will help us get
        the system we really need and will save time in the long run.” Such
        collaboration helps break down the tension that can arise between
        customers and development teams.</p><p class="calibre3">The product champion approach works best if each champion is
        fully empowered to make binding decisions on behalf of the user class
        he represents. If a champion’s decisions are routinely overruled by
        others, his time and goodwill are being wasted. However, the champions
        must remember that they are not the sole customers. Problems arise
        when the individual filling this critical liaison role doesn’t
        adequately communicate with his peers and presents only his own wishes
        and ideas.</p><div class="book" title="External product champions"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2782">External product champions</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">When developing commercial software, it can be difficult to
          find product champions from outside your company. Companies that
          develop commercial products sometimes rely on internal subject
          matter experts or outside consultants to serve as surrogates for
          actual users, who might be unknown or difficult to engage. If you
          have a close working relationship with some major corporate
          customers, they might welcome the opportunity to participate in
          requirements elicitation. You might give external product champions
          economic incentives for their participation. Consider offering them
          discounts on the product or paying for the time they spend working
          with you on requirements. You still face the challenge of how to
          avoid hearing only the champions’ requirements and overlooking the
          needs of other stakeholders. If you have a diverse customer base,
          first identify core requirements that are common to all customers.
          Then define additional requirements that are specific to individual
          corporate customers, market segments, or user classes.</p><p class="calibre3">Another alternative is to hire a suitable product champion who
          has the right background. One company that developed a retail
          point-of-sale and back-office system for a particular industry hired
          three store managers to serve as full-time product champions. As
          another example, my longtime family doctor, Art, left his medical
          practice to become the voice-of-the-physician at a medical software
          company. Art’s new employer believed that it was worth the expense
          to hire a doctor to help the company build software that other
          doctors would accept. A third company hired several former employees
          from one of their major customers. These people provided valuable
          domain expertise as well as insight into the politics of the
          customer organization. To illustrate an alternative engagement
          model, one company had several corporate customers that used their
          invoicing systems extensively. Rather than bringing in product
          champions from the customers, the developing company sent BAs to the
          customer sites. Customers willingly dedicated some of their staff
          time to helping the BAs get the right requirements for the new
          invoicing system.</p><p class="calibre3">Anytime the product champion is a former or simulated user,
          watch out for disconnects between the champion’s perceptions and the
          current needs of real users. Some domains change rapidly, whereas
          others are more stable. Regardless, if people aren’t operating in
          the role anymore, they simply might have forgotten the intricacies
          of the daily job. The essential question is whether the product
          champion, no matter what her background or current job, can
          accurately represent the needs of today’s real users.</p></div><div class="book" title="Product champion expectations"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2783">Product champion expectations</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">To help the product champions succeed, document what you
          expect your champions to do. These written expectations can help you
          build a case for specific individuals to fill this critical role.

          classes, so it needed four product champions selected from the
          internal user community at Contoso Pharmaceuticals. <a class="xref" title="Figure 6-4. Product champion model for the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-138">Figure&nbsp;6-4</a> illustrates how
          the project manager set up a team of BAs and product champions to
          elicit the right requirements from the right sources. These
          champions were not assigned full time, but each one spent several
          hours per week working on the project. Three BAs worked with the
          four product champions to elicit, analyze, and document their
          requirements. (One BA worked with two product champions because the
          Buyer and the Health and Safety Department user classes were small
          and had few requirements.) One of the BAs assembled all the input

          product champion for the Chemist user class, assembled a backup team
          of five chemists from other parts of the company. They represented
          subclasses within the broad Chemist user class. This hierarchical
          approach engaged additional users in requirements development while
          avoiding the expense of massive workshops or dozens of individual
          interviews. Don always strove for consensus. However, he willingly
          made the necessary decisions when agreement wasn’t achieved so the
          project could move ahead. No backup team was necessary when the user
          class was small enough or cohesive enough that one individual truly

            an influential user, Rebecca, agreed to serve as product champion
            for the new claims processing system. Rebecca had many ideas about
            the system features and user interface design. Thrilled to have
            the guidance of an expert, the development team happily complied
            with her requests. After delivery, though, they were shocked to
            receive many complaints about how hard the system was to
            use.</p><p class="calibre3">Rebecca was a power user. She specified usability

            users who <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">weren’t</em></span> experts found the system
            unintuitive and difficult to learn. The BA didn’t recognize that

            large group of non&ndash;power users was disenfranchised in the
            requirements and user interface design processes. Humongous paid
            the price in an expensive redesign. The BA should have engaged at
            least one more product champion to represent the large class of
            nonexpert users.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Selling the product champion idea"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2787">Selling the product champion idea</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Expect to encounter resistance when you propose the idea of
          having product champions on your projects. “The users are too busy.”
          “Management wants to make the decisions.” “They’ll slow us down.”
          “We can’t afford it.” “They’ll run amok and scope will explode.” “I
          don’t know what I’m supposed to do as a product champion.” Some
          users won’t want to cooperate on a project that will make them
          change how they work or might even threaten their jobs. Managers are
          sometimes reluctant to delegate authority for requirements to
          ordinary users.</p><p class="calibre3">Separating business requirements from user requirements
          alleviates some of these discomforts. As an actual user, the product
          champion makes decisions at the user requirements level within the
          scope boundaries imposed by the business requirements. The
          management sponsor retains the authority to make decisions that
          affect the product vision, project scope, business-related
          priorities, schedule, or budget. Documenting and negotiating each
          product champion’s role and responsibilities give candidate
          champions a comfort level about what they’re being asked to do.
          Remind management that a product champion is a key contributor who
          can help the project achieve its business objectives.</p><p class="calibre3">If you encounter resistance, point out that insufficient user
          involvement is a leading cause of software project failure. Remind
          the protesters of problems they’ve experienced on previous projects
          that trace back to inadequate user input. Every organization has
          horror stories of new systems that didn’t satisfy user needs or
          failed to meet unstated usability or performance expectations. You
          can’t afford to rebuild or discard systems that don’t measure up
          because no one understood the requirements. Product champions
          provide one way to get that all-important customer input in a timely
          way, not at the end of the project when customers are disappointed
          and developers are tired.</p></div><div class="book" title="Product champion traps to avoid"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2788">Product champion traps to avoid</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The product champion model has succeeded in many environments.
          It works only when the product champions understand and sign up for
          their responsibilities, have the authority to make decisions at the
          user requirements level, and have time available to do the job.
          Watch out for the following potential problems:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Managers override the decisions that a qualified and duly
              authorized product champion makes. Perhaps a manager has a wild
              new idea at the last minute, or thinks he knows what the users
              need. This behavior often results in dissatisfied users and
              frustrated product champions who feel that management doesn’t
              trust them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">A product champion who forgets that he is representing
              other customers and presents only his own requirements won’t do
              a good job. He might be happy with the outcome, but others
              likely won’t be.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">A product champion who lacks a clear vision of the new
              system might defer decisions to the BA. If all of the BA’s ideas
              are fine with the champion, the champion isn’t providing much
              help.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">A senior user might nominate a less experienced user as
              champion because she doesn’t have time to do the job herself.
              This can lead to backseat driving from the senior user who still
              wishes to strongly influence the project’s direction.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Beware of users who purport to speak for a user class to which
          they do not belong. Rarely, an individual might actively try to
          block the BA from working with the ideal contacts for some reason.
          On the Chemical Tracking System, the product champion for the
          chemical stockroom staff&mdash;herself a former chemist&mdash;initially insisted
          on providing what she thought were the needs of the chemist user
          class. Unfortunately, her input about current chemist needs wasn’t
          accurate. It was difficult to convince her that this wasn’t her job,
          but the BA didn’t let her intimidate him. The project manager lined
          up a separate product champion for the chemists, who did a great job
          of collecting, evaluating, and relaying that community’s
          requirements.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="User representation on agile projects"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2789">User representation on agile projects</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-586" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-596" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1598" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1714" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2477" class="calibre"></a>Frequent conversations between project team members and
        appropriate customers are the most effective way to resolve many
        requirements issues and to flesh out requirements specifics when they
        are needed. Written documentation, however detailed, is an incomplete
        substitute for these ongoing communications. A fundamental tenet of
        Extreme Programming, one of the early agile development methods, is
        the presence of a full-time, on-site customer for these discussions
        (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-65">[ref128]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3">Some agile development methods include a single representative
        of stakeholders called a <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">product owner</em></span> in the
        team to serve as the voice of the customer (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-92">[ref213]</a>;
        <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-104">[ref045]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-93">[ref157]</a>). The product
        owner defines the product’s vision and is responsible for developing
        and prioritizing the contents of the product backlog. (The
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">backlog</em></span> is the prioritized list of user
        stories&mdash;requirements&mdash;for the product and their allocation to upcoming
        iterations, called sprints in the agile development method called
        Scrum.) The product owner therefore spans all three levels of
        requirements: business, user, and functional. He essentially straddles
        the product champion and business analyst functions, representing the
        customer, defining product features, prioritizing them, and so forth.
        Ultimately, someone does have to make decisions about exactly what
        capabilities to deliver in the product and when. In Scrum, that’s the
        product owner’s responsibility.</p><p class="calibre3">The ideal state of having a single product owner isn’t always
        practical. We know of one company that was implementing a package
        solution to run their insurance business. The organization was too big
        and complex to have one person who understood everything in enough
        detail to make all decisions about the implementation. Instead, the
        customers selected a product owner from each department to own the
        priorities for the functionality used by that department. The
        company’s CIO served as the lead product owner. The CIO understood the
        entire product vision, so he could ensure that the departments were on
        track to deliver that vision. He had responsibility for decision
        making when there were conflicts between department-level product
        owners.</p><p class="calibre3">The premises of the on-site customer and close customer
        collaboration with developers that agile methods espouse certainly are
        sound. In fact, we feel strongly that <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">all</em></span>
        development projects warrant this emphasis on user involvement. As you
        have seen, though, all but the smallest projects have multiple user
        classes, as well as numerous additional stakeholders whose interests
        must be represented. In many cases it’s not realistic to expect a
        single individual to be able to adequately understand and describe the
        needs of all relevant user classes, nor to make all the decisions
        associated with product definition. Particularly with internal
        corporate projects, it will generally work better to use a
        representative structure like the product champion model to ensure
        adequate user engagement.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-850" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-871" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2479" class="calibre"></a>The product owner and product champion schemes are not
        mutually exclusive. If the product owner is functioning in the role of
        a business analyst, rather than as a stakeholder representative
        himself, he could set up a structure with one or more product
        champions to see that the most appropriate sources provide input.
        Alternatively, the product owner could collaborate with one or more
        business analysts, who then work with stakeholders to understand their
        requirements. The product owner would then serve as the ultimate
        decision maker.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2790" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">“On-sight” customer</div><p class="calibre3">I once wrote programs for a research scientist who sat about
          10 feet from my desk. John could provide instantaneous answers to my
          questions, provide feedback on user interface designs, and clarify
          our informally written requirements. One day John moved to a new
          office, around the corner on the same floor of the same building,
          about 100 feet away. I perceived an immediate drop in my programming
          productivity because of the cycle time delay in getting John’s
          input. I spent more time fixing problems because sometimes I went
          down the wrong path before I could get a course correction. There’s
          no substitute for having the right customers continuously available
          to the developers both on-site and “on-sight.” Beware, though, of
          too-frequent interruptions that make it hard for people to refocus
          their attention on their work. It can take up to 15 minutes to
          reimmerse yourself into the highly productive, focused state of mind
          called <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">flow</em></span> (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-140">[ref060]</a>).</p></div><p class="calibre3">An on-site customer doesn’t guarantee the desired outcome. My
        colleague Chris, a project manager, established a development team
        environment with minimal physical barriers and engaged two product
        champions. Chris offered this report: “While the close proximity seems
        to work for the development team, the results with product champions
        have been mixed. One sat in our midst and still managed to avoid us
        all. The new champion does a fine job of interacting with the
        developers and has truly enabled the rapid development of software.”
        There is no substitute for having the right people, in the right role,
        in the right place, with the right attitude.</p></div><div class="book" title="Resolving conflicting requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2791">Resolving conflicting requirements</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Someone must resolve conflicting requirements from different

        where marketing never said no to a customer request, no matter how
        infeasible or expensive. The team needs to decide who will be making
        decisions on the project’s requirements before they confront these
        types of issues. Otherwise, indecision and the revisiting of previous
        decisions can stall the project in endless wrangling. If you’re a BA
        caught in this dilemma, rely on your organizational structure and
        processes to work through the disagreements. But, as we’ve cautioned
        before, there aren’t any easy solutions if you’re working with truly
        unreasonable people.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2793" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Next steps</div><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Relate <a class="xref" title="Figure 6-3. Some possible communication pathways between the user and the developer." href="#calibre_link-135">Figure&nbsp;6-3</a> to the way

Years after I

              contracted to build the Chemical Tracking System. The developers
              found that the requirements specification we created using this
              product champion model provided a solid foundation for the
              development work. The system was delivered successfully and was

I’m Phil, the business
      analyst for the new employee information system we’re going to build for
      you. Thanks for agreeing to be the product champion for this project.
      Your input will help us a lot. So, can you tell me what you
      want?”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“Hmmm, what do I want?” mused Maria. “I hardly know
      where to start. The new system should be a lot faster than the old one.
      And you know how the old system crashes if an employee has a really long
      name and we have to call the help desk and ask them to enter the name
      for us? The new system should take long names without crashing. Also, a
      new law says we can’t use Social Security numbers for employee IDs
      anymore, so we’ll have to change all of the IDs when the new system goes
      in. Oh, yes, it’d be great if I could get a report of how many hours of
      training each employee has had so far this year.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Phil dutifully wrote down everything Maria said, but his
      head was spinning. Maria’s desires were so scattered that he wasn’t sure
      he was getting all her requirements. He had no idea if Maria’s needs
      aligned with the project’s business objectives. And he didn’t know
      exactly what to do with all these bits of information. Phil wasn’t sure
      what to ask next.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">The heart of requirements development is
      <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">elicitation</em></span>, the process of identifying the needs
      and constraints of the various stakeholders for a software system.
      Elicitation is not the same as “gathering requirements.” Nor is it a
      simple matter of transcribing exactly what users say. Elicitation is a
      collaborative and analytical process that includes activities to
      collect, discover, extract, and define requirements. Elicitation is used
      to discover business, user, functional, and nonfunctional requirements,
      along with other types of information. Requirements elicitation is
      perhaps the most challenging, critical, error-prone, and
      communication-intensive aspect of software development.</p><p class="calibre3">Engaging users in the elicitation process is a way to gain support
      and buy-in for the project. If you’re the business analyst, try to
      understand the thought processes behind the requirements the users
      state. Walk through the processes that users follow to make decisions
      about their work, and extract the underlying logic. Make sure that
      everyone understands why the system must perform certain functions. Look
      for proposed requirements that reflect obsolete or ineffective business
      processes or rules that should <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">not</em></span> be incorporated
      into a new system.</p><p class="calibre3">The BA must create an environment conducive to a thorough
      exploration of the product being specified. To facilitate clear
      communication, use the vocabulary of the business domain instead of
      forcing customers to understand technical jargon. Record significant
      application domain terms in a glossary, rather than assuming that all
      participants share the same definitions. Customers must understand that
      a discussion about possible functionality is not a commitment to include
      it in the product. Brainstorming and imagining the possibilities is a
      separate matter from analyzing priorities, feasibility, and the
      constraining realities. It’s never too early for stakeholders to
      prioritize their blue-sky wish lists to avoid defining an enormous
      project that never delivers anything useful.</p><p class="calibre3">The output of requirements development is a common understanding
      of the needs held by the diverse project stakeholders. When the
      developers understand those needs, they can explore alternative
      solutions to address them. Elicitation participants should resist the
      temptation to design the system until they understand the problem.
      Otherwise, they can expect to do considerable design rework as the
      requirements become better defined. Emphasizing user tasks rather than
      user interfaces, and focusing on true needs more than on expressed
      desires, help keep the team from being sidetracked by prematurely
      specifying design details.</p><p class="calibre3">As <a class="xref" title="Figure 7-1. The cyclic nature of requirements elicitation, analysis, and specification." href="#calibre_link-145">Figure&nbsp;7-1</a>
      shows, the nature of requirements development is cyclic. You will do
      some elicitation, study what you learned, write some requirements,
      perhaps determine that you are missing some information, perform
      additional elicitation, and so forth. Don’t expect to just hold a couple
      of elicitation workshops and then declare victory and move on.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-145" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2795" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000026.gif" alt="The cyclic nature of requirements elicitation, analysis, and specification." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;7-1.&nbsp;The cyclic nature of requirements elicitation, analysis, and

      elicitation techniques you might find valuable.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-146" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2796" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000027.jpeg" alt="An illustration showing a set of six boxes running from             left to right with arrows between them.

        software projects. In fact, no project team should expect to use only
        one elicitation technique. There are always many types of information
        to be discovered, and different stakeholders will prefer different
        approaches. One user might be able to clearly articulate how he uses
        the system, whereas you might need to observe another performing her
        job to reach the same level of understanding.</p><p class="calibre3">Elicitation techniques include both facilitated activities, in
        which you interact with stakeholders to elicit requirements, and
        independent activities, in which you work on your own to discover
        information. Facilitated activities primarily focus on discovering
        business and user requirements. Working directly with users is
        necessary because user requirements encompass the tasks that users
        need to accomplish with the system. To elicit business requirements,
        you will need to work with people such as the project sponsor. The
        independent elicitation techniques supplement requirements that users
        present and reveal needed functionality that end users might not be
        aware of. Most projects will use a combination of both facilitated and
        independent elicitation activities. Each technique offers a different
        exploration of the requirements or might even reveal completely
        different requirements. The following sections describe several
        techniques commonly used to elicit requirements.</p><div class="book" title="Interviews"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2798">Interviews</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The most obvious way to find out what the users of a software
          system need is to ask them. Interviews are a traditional source of
          requirements input for both commercial products and information
          systems, across all software development approaches. Most BAs will
          facilitate some form of individual or small-group interviews to
          elicit requirements on their projects. Agile projects make extensive
          use of interviews as a mechanism to get direct user involvement.
          Interviews are easier to schedule and lead than large-group
          activities such as requirements workshops.</p><p class="calibre3">If you are new to an application domain, interviews with
          experts can help you get up to speed quickly. This will allow you to
          prepare draft requirements and models to use in other interviews or
          in workshops. If you can establish rapport with the interviewees,
          they will feel safer when sharing their thoughts one-on-one or in a
          small group than in a larger workshop, particularly about touchy
          topics. It’s also easier to get user buy-in about participating in
          the project or reviewing existing requirements during a one-on-one
          or small-group interview than in a large group setting. Interviews
          are appropriate for eliciting business requirements from executives
          who do not have a lot of time to meet.</p><p class="calibre3">For guidance on how to conduct user interviews, see <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-147">[ref003]</a> and <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-148">[ref187]</a>. A few suggestions
          for conducting interviews follow. These are useful tips for
          conducting elicitation workshops as well.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Establish rapport</strong></span> To begin
          an interview, introduce yourself if the attendees don’t already know
          you, review the agenda, remind attendees of the session objectives,
          and address any preliminary questions or concerns attendees
          have.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-837" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1127" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1215" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1344" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1545" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1773" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2095" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2213" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2566" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Stay in scope</strong></span> As
          with any elicitation session, keep the discussion focused on its
          objective. Even when you are talking with just one person or a small
          group, there’s a chance the interview will go off topic.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Prepare questions and straw man models
          ahead of time</strong></span> Prepare for interviews by drafting any
          materials you can beforehand, such as a list of questions to guide
          the conversation. Draft materials will give your users a starting
          point to think from. People can often critique content more easily
          than they can create it. Preparing questions and drafting straw man
          models are described further in the <a class="xref" title="Preparing for elicitation" href="#calibre_link-149">Preparing for elicitation</a> section later in this
          chapter.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Suggest ideas</strong></span> Rather than
          simply transcribing what customers say, a creative BA proposes ideas
          and alternatives during elicitation. Sometimes users don’t realize
          the capabilities developers can provide; they might get excited when
          you suggest functionality that will make the system especially
          valuable. When users truly can’t express what they need, perhaps you
          can watch them work and suggest ways to automate portions of the job
          (see the <a class="xref" title="Observations" href="#calibre_link-150">Observations</a> section later in this
          chapter). BAs can think outside the mental box that limits people
          who are too close to the problem domain.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Listen actively</strong></span> Practice
          the techniques of active listening (leaning forward, showing
          patience, giving verbal feedback, and inquiring when something is
          unclear) and paraphrasing (restating the main idea of a speaker’s
          message to show your understanding of that message).</p></div><div class="book" title="Workshops"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-337">Workshops</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Workshops encourage stakeholder collaboration in defining
          requirements. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-83">[ref093]</a> defines a requirements
          workshop as “a structured meeting in which a carefully selected
          group of stakeholders and content experts work together to define,
          create, refine, and reach closure on deliverables (such as models
          and documents) that represent user requirements.” Workshops are
          facilitated sessions with multiple stakeholders and formal roles,
          such as a facilitator and a scribe. Workshops often include several
          types of stakeholders, from users to developers to testers. They are
          used to elicit requirements from multiple stakeholders concurrently.
          Working in a group is more effective for resolving disagreements
          than is talking to people individually. Also, workshops are helpful
          when quick elicitation turnaround is needed because of schedule
          constraints.</p><p class="calibre3">According to one authority, “Facilitation is the art of
          leading people through processes toward agreed-upon objectives in a
          manner that encourages participation, ownership, and productivity
          from all involved” (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-151">[ref220]</a>). The facilitator
          plays a critical role in planning the workshop, selecting
          participants, and guiding them to a successful outcome. Business
          analysts frequently facilitate elicitation workshops. When a team is
          getting started with new approaches to requirements elicitation,
          consider having an outside facilitator or a second BA facilitate the
          initial workshops. This way the lead BA can devote his full
          attention to the discussion. If the sole BA is also acting as
          facilitator, she needs to be mindful of when she is speaking as a
          facilitator and when she is participating in the discussion. A
          scribe assists the facilitator by capturing the points that come up
          during the discussion. It’s extremely challenging to facilitate,
          scribe, and participate simultaneously and do a good job on all
          three.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1632" class="calibre"></a>Workshops can be resource intensive, sometimes
          requiring numerous participants for several days at a time. They
          must be well planned to avoid wasting time. Minimize wasted time by
          coming into a workshop with drafts of materials prepared ahead of
          time. For example, you might draft use cases that can be reviewed as
          a group rather than having the entire group draft them together.
          Rarely does it make sense to start a workshop with a completely
          blank slate. Use other elicitation techniques prior to the
          workshops, and then bring the stakeholders together to work through
          only the necessary areas.</p><p class="calibre3">General facilitation practices apply to requirements
          elicitation (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-152">[ref214]</a>). A definitive resource
          specific to facilitating requirements elicitation workshops is
          Gottesdiener’s <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Requirements by Collaboration</em></span>
          (2002). She describes a wealth of techniques and tools for workshop
          facilitation. Following are a few tips for conducting effective
          elicitation workshops, many of which also apply to
          interviews.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Establish and enforce ground
          rules</strong></span> The workshop participants should agree on some
          basic operating principles. Examples include starting and ending on
          time; returning from breaks promptly; silencing electronic devices;
          holding one conversation at a time; expecting everyone to
          contribute; and focusing comments and criticisms on issues rather
          than individuals. After the rules are set, ensure that participants
          follow them.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Fill all of the team roles</strong></span>
          A facilitator must make sure that the following tasks are covered by
          people in the workshop: note taking, time keeping, scope management,
          ground rule management, and making sure everyone is heard. A scribe
          might record what’s going on, while someone else watches the
          clock.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Plan an agenda</strong></span> Each
          workshop needs a clear plan, as discussed in the <a class="xref" title="Preparing for elicitation" href="#calibre_link-149">Preparing for elicitation</a> section later in this
          chapter. Create the plan and workshop agenda ahead of time, and
          communicate them to participants so they know the objectives and
          what to expect and can prepare accordingly.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Stay in scope</strong></span> Refer to the
          business requirements to confirm whether proposed user requirements
          lie within the current project scope. Keep each workshop focused on
          the right level of abstraction for that session’s objectives. Groups
          easily dive into distracting detail during requirements discussions.
          Those discussions consume time that the group should spend on
          developing a higher-level understanding of user requirements; the
          details will come later. The facilitator will have to reel in the
          elicitation participants periodically to keep them on topic.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-2799" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Watch out for off-topic discussions, such as design
            explorations, during elicitation sessions. Keep the participants
            focused on the session’s objectives, while assuring them that
            they’ll have future opportunities to work through other issues
            that arise.</p></div><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Use parking lots to capture items for
          later consideration</strong></span> An array of random but important
          information will surface during elicitation discussions: quality
          attributes, business rules, user interface ideas, and more. Organize
          this information on flipcharts&mdash;parking lots&mdash;so you don’t lose it and
          to demonstrate respect for the participant who brought it up. Don’t
          be distracted into discussing off-topic details unless they turn out
          to be showstoppers. Describe what will happen with the parking lot
          issues following the meeting.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1088" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1213" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1273" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2309" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Timebox discussions</strong></span>
          Consider allocating a fixed period of time to each discussion topic.
          The discussion might need to be completed later, but timeboxing
          helps avoid the trap of spending far more time than intended on the
          first topic and neglecting other important topics entirely. When
          closing a timeboxed discussion, summarize status and next steps
          before leaving the topic.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Keep the team small but include the
          right stakeholders</strong></span> Small groups can work much faster than
          larger teams. Elicitation workshops with more than five or six
          active participants can become mired in side trips, concurrent
          conversations, and bickering. Consider running multiple workshops in
          parallel to explore the requirements of different user classes.
          Workshop participants could include the product champion and other
          user representatives, perhaps a subject matter expert, a BA, a
          developer, and a tester. Knowledge, experience, and the authority to
          make decisions are qualifications for participating in elicitation
          workshops.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2800" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Too many cooks</div><p class="calibre3">Requirements elicitation workshops that involve too many
            participants can slow to a contentious crawl. My colleague Debbie
            was frustrated at the sluggish progress of the first use case
            workshop she facilitated for a website project. The 12
            participants held extended discussions of unnecessary details and
            couldn’t agree on how each use case ought to work. The team’s
            progress accelerated nicely when Debbie reduced the number of
            participants to about six who represented the key roles of
            analyst, customer, system architect, developer, and visual
            designer. The workshop lost some input by using the smaller team,
            but the rate of progress more than compensated for that loss. The
            workshop participants should exchange information off-line with
            colleagues who don’t attend and then bring the collected input to
            the workshops.</p></div><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Keep everyone engaged</strong></span>
          Sometimes certain participants will stop contributing to the
          discussion. These people might be frustrated for a variety of
          reasons. Perhaps their input isn’t being taken seriously because
          other participants don’t find their concerns interesting, or maybe
          they don’t want to disrupt the work that the group has completed so
          far. Perhaps the stakeholder who has withdrawn is deferring to more
          aggressive participants or a domineering analyst. The facilitator
          must read the body language (lack of eye contact, fidgeting,
          sighing, checking the clock), understand why someone has tuned out
          of the process, and try to re-engage the person. Visual cues are
          absent when you are facilitating via a teleconference, so you have
          to listen carefully to learn who is not participating and the tones
          being used. You might ask these silent individuals directly if they
          have any thoughts about the discussion they’d like to share. The
          facilitator must ensure that everyone is heard.</p></div><div class="book" title="Focus groups"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2801">Focus groups</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">A focus group is a representative group of users who convene
          in a facilitated elicitation activity to generate input and ideas on
          a product’s functional and quality requirements. Focus group
          sessions must be interactive, allowing all users a chance to voice
          their thoughts. Focus groups are useful for exploring users’
          attitudes, impressions, preferences, and needs (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-44">[ref115]</a>). They are particularly valuable if you are
          developing commercial products and don’t have ready access to end
          users within your company.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2802" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">When conflicts erupt</div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-870" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1103" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1596" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2486" class="calibre"></a>Differing perspectives, priorities, and
            personalities can lead to conflict and even anger within a group.
            If this happens, deal with it immediately. Look for nonverbal
            clues showing conflict or anger and try to understand the cause.
            When the group is clear on the reason for the conflict, you might
            be able to find a solution to it (if one is needed).</p><p class="calibre3">If an individual simply will not participate in a productive
            way, talk with him privately to determine whether his presence
            will prevent the group from moving forward. If so, you might need
            to thank the person for his time and continue without him.
            Sometimes this will not be an option and you need to simply
            abandon the session or topic completely for now. Conflict
            management is a complex skill to develop and there are numerous
            resources on this (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-95">[ref073]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-153">[ref183]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3">I once scheduled a session to elicit business requirements
            from a new director of sales. He was known to have an antagonistic
            personality, so I came to the meeting prepared to really listen to
            and understand his desires. In the very first minute of the
            meeting, he started yelling at me, asking why we were holding this
            meeting at all. He said, “Who are you to think you have a right to
            ask me about my business objectives?” I took a deep breath and a
            long pause. Then I tried to explain why I needed to understand his
            business objectives&mdash;that without them, the team would be guessing
            at what we needed to develop to meet the customers’ desires, and
            he would be sorely disappointed with the results. And as fast as
            he got mad, he got over it. Without hesitation, he started
            rattling off his business objectives. Thankfully my scribe was
            there to catch them because I was still a bit taken aback by the
            whole exchange.</p></div><p class="calibre3">Often, you will have a large and diverse user base to draw
          from, so select the focus group members carefully. Include users who
          have used previous versions or products similar to the one you’re
          implementing. Either select a pool of users who are of the same type
          (and hold multiple focus groups for the different user classes) or
          select a pool representing the full spectrum of user classes so
          everyone is equally represented.</p><p class="calibre3">Focus groups must be facilitated. You will need to keep them
          on topic, but without influencing the opinions being expressed. You
          might want to record the session so you can go back and listen
          carefully to comments. Do not expect quantitative analysis from
          focus groups, but rather a lot of subjective feedback that can be
          further evaluated and prioritized as requirements are developed.
          Elicitation sessions with focus groups benefit from many of the same
          tips described previously for workshops. Participants in focus
          groups normally do not have decision-making authority for
          requirements.</p></div><div class="book" title="Observations"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-150">Observations</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">When you ask users to describe how they do their jobs, they
          will likely have a hard time being precise&mdash;details might be missing
          or incorrect. Often this is because tasks are complex and it’s hard
          to remember every minute detail. In other cases, it is because users
          are so familiar with executing a task that they can’t articulate
          everything they do. Perhaps the task is so habitual that they don’t
          even think about it. Sometimes you can learn a lot by observing
          exactly how users perform their tasks.</p><p class="calibre3">Observations are time consuming, so they aren’t suitable for
          every user or every task. To avoid disrupting the users’ regularly
          assigned work activities, limit each observation time to two hours
          or less. Select important or high-risk tasks and multiple user
          classes for observations. If you use observations in agile projects,
          have the user demonstrate only the specific tasks related to the
          forthcoming iteration.</p><p class="calibre3">Observing a user’s workflow in the task environment allows the
          BA to validate information collected from other sources, to identify
          new topics for interviews, to see problems with the current system,
          and to identify ways that the new system can better support the
          workflow. The BA must abstract and generalize beyond the observed
          user’s activities to ensure that the requirements captured apply to
          the user class as a whole, not just to that individual. A skillful
          BA can also often suggest ideas for improving the user’s current
          business processes.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2803" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Watch me bake a cake</div><p class="calibre3">To demonstrate the power of observations, tell some friends
            the steps to bake a cake from a mix. You’ll likely remember the
            steps to turn on the oven, get out the necessary dishes and
            utensils, add each ingredient, mix the ingredients, prepare the
            pan, put the batter in the pan, bake it, and pull it out of the
            oven when done. But when you told your friends to add each
            ingredient, did you remember to say to open the bag with the mix
            in it? Did you remember to say to crack the eggshell, add only the
            contents of the egg, and discard the shell? These seemingly
            obvious steps might not be so obvious to someone who has never
            baked before.</p></div><p class="calibre3">Observations can be silent or interactive. Silent observations
          are appropriate when busy users cannot be interrupted. Interactive
          observations allow the BA to interrupt the user mid-task and ask a
          question. This is useful to understand immediately why a user made a
          choice or to ask him what he was thinking about when he took some
          action. Document what you observe for further analysis after the
          session. You might also consider video recording the session, if
          policies allow, so you can refresh your memory later.</p><p class="calibre3">I was developing a call-center application for customer
          service representatives (CSRs) who were used to having to page
          through printed catalogs to find products that customers wanted to
          order. The BA team met with several CSRs to elicit use cases for the
          new application. Each one said how difficult it was to have to flip
          through multiple catalogs to find exactly what product a customer
          was referring to. Each BA sat with a different CSR while the CSRs
          took orders over the phone. We saw the difficulty they faced by
          watching them first try to find the catalog by date, then try to
          locate the right product. The observation sessions helped us
          understand what features they would need in an online product
          catalog.</p></div><div class="book" title="Questionnaires"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2804">Questionnaires</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1110" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1120" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1410" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1884" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2232" class="calibre"></a>Questionnaires are a way to survey large groups of

          populations, and they can be administered easily across geographical
          boundaries. The analyzed results of questionnaires can be used as an
          input to other elicitation techniques. For example, you might use a
          questionnaire to identify users’ biggest pain points with an
          existing system, then use the results to discuss prioritization with
          decision makers in a workshop. You can also use questionnaires to

              of).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Don’t phrase a question in a way that implies a “correct”

              you want to use the questionnaire results for statistical
              analysis. Open-ended questions allows users to respond any way
              they want, so it’s hard to look for commonalities in the
              results.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Consider consulting with an expert in questionnaire design

          that entails examining the systems to which your system connects.
          System interface analysis reveals functional requirements regarding
          the exchange of data and services between systems (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-44">[ref115]</a>). Context diagrams and ecosystem maps (see <a class="xref" title="Chapter 5. Establishing the business requirements" href="#calibre_link-32">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>) are an obvious
          choice to begin finding interfaces for further study. In fact, if
          you find an interface that has associated requirements and that is
          <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">not</em></span> represented in one of these diagrams, the
          diagrams are incomplete.</p><p class="calibre3">For each system that interfaces with yours, identify
          functionality in the other system that might lead to requirements
          for your system. These requirements could describe what data to pass
          to the other system, what data is received from it, and rules about
          that data, such as validation criteria. You might also discover
          existing functionality that you do <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">not</em></span> need to
          implement in your system. Suppose you thought you needed to
          implement validation rules for a shopping-cart order in an
          e-commerce website before passing it to an order-management system.
          Through system interface analysis, you might learn that multiple
          systems pass orders to the order-management system, which performs
          the validation, so you don’t need to build this function.</p></div><div class="book" title="User interface analysis"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2806">User interface analysis</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1018" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1086" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1125" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1411" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2433" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2437" class="calibre"></a>User interface (UI) analysis is an independent
          elicitation technique in which you study existing systems to
          discover user and functional requirements. It’s best to interact
          with the existing systems directly, but if necessary you can use
          screen shots. User manuals for purchased packaged-software
          implementations often contain screen shots that will work fine as a
          starting point. If there is no existing system, you might be able to
          look at user interfaces of similar products.</p><p class="calibre3">When working with packaged solutions or an existing system, UI
          analysis can help you identify a complete list of screens to help
          you discover potential features. By navigating the existing UI, you
          can learn about the common steps users take in the system and draft
          use cases to review with users. UI analysis can reveal pieces of
          data that users need to see. It’s a great way to get up to speed on
          how an existing system works (unless you need a lot of training to
          do so). Instead of asking users how they interact with the system
          and what steps they take, perhaps you can reach an initial
          understanding yourself.</p><p class="calibre3">Do not assume that certain functionality is needed in the new
          system just because you found it in an existing one. Furthermore, do
          not assume that because the UI looks or flows a certain way in the
          current system that it must be implemented that way in the future
          system.</p></div><div class="book" title="Document analysis"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2807">Document analysis</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Document analysis entails examining any existing documentation
          for potential software requirements. The most useful documentation
          includes requirements specifications, business processes,
          lessons-learned collections, and user manuals for existing or
          similar applications. Documents can describe corporate or industry
          standards that must be followed or regulations with which the
          product must comply. When replacing an existing system, past
          documentation can reveal functionality that might need to be
          retained, as well as obsolete functionality. For packaged-solution
          implementations, the vendor documentation mentions functionality
          that your users might need, but you might have to further explore
          just how to implement it in the target environment. Comparative
          reviews point out shortcomings in other products that you could
          address to gain a competitive advantage. Problem reports and
          enhancement requests collected from users by help desk and field
          support personnel can offer ideas for improving the system in future
          releases.</p><p class="calibre3">Document analysis is a way to get up to speed on an existing
          system or a new domain. Doing some research and drafting some
          requirements beforehand reduces the elicitation meeting time needed.
          Document analysis can reveal information people don’t tell you,
          either because they don’t think of it or because they aren’t aware
          of it. For example, if you are building a new call-center
          application, you might find some complicated business logic
          described in the user manual for an existing application. Perhaps
          users don’t even know about this logic. You can use the results of
          this analysis as input to user interviews.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1106" class="calibre"></a>A risk with this technique is that the available
          documents might not be up to date. Requirements might have changed
          without the specifications being updated, or functionality might be
          documented that is not needed in a new system.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Planning elicitation on your project"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2808">Planning elicitation on your project</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Early in a project, the business analyst should plan the

        action increases the chance of success and sets realistic expectations
        for the stakeholders. Only by gaining explicit commitment on
        elicitation resources, schedule, and deliverables can you avoid having
        participants pulled away to do other work. An elicitation plan
        includes the techniques you’ll use, when you plan to use them, and for
        what purpose. As with any plan, use it as a guide and reminder

              severity of each risk, and decide how you can mitigate or
              control it. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 32. Software requirements and risk management" href="#calibre_link-16">Chapter&nbsp;32</a> for more

        interviews and workshops&mdash;and do not think to use other techniques that
        might reduce resource needs or increase the quality of the information
        discovered. Rarely will a BA get the best results by using only one
        elicitation technique on a project. Elicitation techniques apply
        across the spectrum of development approaches. The selection of
        elicitation techniques should be based on the characteristics of the
        project.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1108" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1214" class="calibre"></a><a class="xref" title="Figure 7-3. Suggested elicitation techniques by project characteristic." href="#calibre_link-155">Figure&nbsp;7-3</a> suggests the

        characteristics of your project and read to the right to see which
        elicitation techniques are most likely to be helpful (marked with an

        likely to get the best results with a combination of stakeholder
        interviews, workshops, and system interface analysis. Most projects
        can make use of interviews and workshops. Focus groups are more
        appropriate than workshops for mass-market software because you have a
        large external user base but limited access to representatives. These
        suggestions for elicitation techniques are just that&mdash;suggestions. For

        session, communicating an agenda, preparing questions, and drafting
        materials that might be useful during the session. The following tips
        will help you prepare for elicitation.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Plan session scope and agenda</strong></span>
        Decide on the scope of the elicitation session, taking into account
        how much time is available. You might define the session scope by
        using a set of topics or questions, or you might list a specific set
        of process flows or use cases to be explored. Align the scope of the
        session with the overall project scope defined in the business
        requirements so you can keep the conversation on topic. The agenda
        should itemize what topics will be covered, the available time for
        each topic, and targeted objectives. Share the session agenda with
        stakeholders in advance.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Prepare resources</strong></span> Schedule
        the physical resources needed, such as rooms, projectors,
        teleconference numbers, and videoconferencing equipment. Also,
        schedule the participants, being sensitive to time zone differences if
        you are not all in the same location. For geographically dispersed
        groups, change the schedule each time you meet so the sessions do not
        always inconvenience the same people in a particular part of the
        world. Collect documentation from various sources. Gain access to
        systems as necessary. Take online training to learn about existing
        systems.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Learn about the stakeholders</strong></span>
        Identify the relevant stakeholders for the session (see <a class="xref" title="Chapter 6. Finding the voice of the user" href="#calibre_link-61">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>). Learn about the
        stakeholders’ cultural and regional preferences for meetings. If some
        of the participants are not native speakers of the language in which
        the session will be conducted, consider providing them with supporting
        documentation, such as slides, ahead of time so they can read ahead or
        follow along. The slides can list specific questions you will be
        asking or simply provide context for the session that you might also
        verbally explain. Avoid creating an “us” versus “them” tension.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Prepare questions</strong></span> Go into
        every facilitated elicitation session with a set of prepared
        questions. Use areas of uncertainty in straw man models (described in
        the next section) as a source of questions. If you are preparing for
        an interview or workshop, use results from other elicitation
        techniques to identify unresolved questions. There are many sources of
        suggested questions for elicitation (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-157">[ref170]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3">Phrase your questions to avoid leading customers down an
        unintended path or toward a specific answer. As an analyst, you must
        probe beneath the surface of the requirements the customers present to
        understand their true needs. Simply asking users, “What do you want?”
        generates a mass of random information that leaves the analyst
        floundering. “What do you need to do?” is a much better question.
        Asking “why” several times can move the discussion from a presented
        solution to a solid understanding of the problem that needs to be
        solved. Ask open-ended questions to help you understand the users’
        current business processes and to see how the new system could improve
        their performance.</p><p class="calibre3">Imagine yourself learning the user’s job, or actually do the job
        under the user’s direction. What tasks would you perform? What
        questions would you have? Another approach is to play the role of an
        apprentice learning from a master user. The user you are interviewing
        then guides the discussion and describes what he views as the
        important topics for discussion.</p><p class="calibre3">Probe around the exceptions. What could prevent the user from
        successfully completing a task? How should the system respond to
        various error conditions? Ask questions that begin with “What else
        could …,” “What happens when …,” “Would you ever need to …,” “Where do
        you get …,” “Why do you (or don’t you) …,” and “Does anyone ever …”
        Document the source of each requirement so that you can obtain further
        clarification if needed and trace development activities back to
        specific customer origins.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1121" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1212" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2214" class="calibre"></a>As with any improvement activity, dissatisfaction with
        the current situation provides excellent fodder for the new and
        improved future state. When you’re working on a replacement project
        for a legacy system, ask the users, “What three things annoy you the
        most about the existing system?” This question surfaces expectations
        that the users hold for the follow-on system.</p><p class="calibre3">You won’t have&mdash;nor do you need&mdash;a perfect script going into an
        interview or a workshop. The prepared questions are to help you if you
        get stuck. The questions should seem natural and comfortable&mdash;like a
        conversation, not an interrogation. Five minutes into a session, you
        might realize that you missed an important area for discussion. Be
        ready to abandon your questions if needed. At the end of your session,
        ask “Is there anything else you expected me to ask?” to try to surface
        issues you just didn’t think of.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Prepare straw man models</strong></span>
        Analysis models can be used during elicitation sessions to help users
        provide better requirements. Some of the most useful models are use
        cases and process flows because they closely align with how people
        think about doing their jobs. Create straw man, or draft, models ahead
        of your elicitation sessions. A straw man serves as a starting point
        that helps you learn about the topic and inspires your users to think
        of ideas. It is easier to revise a draft model than to create one from
        scratch.</p><p class="calibre3">If you are new to the project’s domain, it might be hard to
        create a draft model on your own. Use other elicitation techniques to
        glean enough knowledge to work from. Read existing documents, examine
        existing systems for models you can reuse as a starting point, or hold
        a one-on-one interview with a subject matter expert to learn enough to
        get started. Then tell the group you’re working with, “This model will
        probably be wrong. Please tear it apart and tell me how it should
        look. You won’t hurt my feelings.”</p></div><div class="book" title="Performing elicitation activities"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2811">Performing elicitation activities</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 7-5. The perform elicitation activities step for a single elicitation session." href="#calibre_link-158">Figure&nbsp;7-5</a>

          elicitation session.</div></div><p class="calibre3">Executing the elicitation activity itself is relatively
        obvious&mdash;if you are interviewing, you talk to people; if you are
        performing document analysis, you read the document. However, when
        facilitating an elicitation activity, the following tips might be
        useful.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1027" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Educate stakeholders</strong></span>
        Teach your stakeholders about your elicitation approach and why you
        chose it. Explain the exploration techniques you’ll be using, such as
        use cases or process flows, and how they can help stakeholders provide
        better requirements. Also describe how you will capture their
        information and send them materials for review after the
        session.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Take good notes</strong></span> Assign
        someone who isn’t actively participating in the discussion to be the
        scribe, responsible for taking accurate notes. Session notes should
        contain an attendee list, invitees who did not attend, decisions made,
        actions to be taken and who is responsible for each, outstanding
        issues, and the high points of key discussions. Unfortunately, BAs
        sometimes hold facilitated elicitation sessions without a dedicated
        scribe and have to fill the role themselves. If you’re in this
        situation, be prepared to write shorthand, type fast, or use a
        recording device (if the participants agree). Audio pens can translate
        handwritten notes to electronic form and tie them to the recorded
        audio discussion. You can also use whiteboards and paper on the walls
        and photograph them.</p><p class="calibre3">Prepare questions ahead of time to eliminate some of the
        on-the-spot thinking necessary to keep the conversation going. Come up
        with a shorthand notation to capture a question that comes to mind
        while someone is talking, so you can quickly flip back to it when you
        have an opportunity. Don’t try to capture diagrams in complicated
        diagramming software; just photograph sketched diagrams or draw
        quickly by hand.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Exploit the physical space</strong></span>
        Most rooms have four walls, so use them during facilitation to draw
        diagrams or create lists. If there aren’t whiteboards available,
        attach big sheets of paper to the walls. Have sticky notes and markers
        available. Invite other participants to get up and contribute to the
        wall as well; moving around helps to keep people engaged. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-83">[ref093]</a> refers to this technique as the “Wall of Wonder”
        collaboration pattern. If there are existing artifacts to look at
        (such as straw man models, existing requirements, or existing
        systems), project them on the wall.</p><p class="calibre3">Facilitating collaborative sessions with participants in
        multiple locations requires more creativity. You can use online
        conferencing tools to share slides and permit interactions. If several
        participants are in the same room, use videoconferencing tools to show
        remote participants what’s on the walls and whiteboards.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2813" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Stakeholders on the move</div><p class="calibre3">I once facilitated a workshop to elicit process flows for a
          semiconductor fabrication plant with a dozen engineers. I started
          out by working at the whiteboard, drawing the flows as we talked.
          Each time we completed a flow, I’d stop to photograph it before
          moving on to the next. Half a day into the first session, one of the
          engineers asked if he could have a turn at the whiteboard. I happily
          handed him the marker. He had learned the flowchart notation, and
          since he was already an expert in the system, he could easily draw
          the flow on the board. He then walked us through it, asking his
          peers at each step to validate or correct it. He was leading the
          process, which allowed me to focus on asking probing questions and
          taking notes. Soon, all the engineers were passing the marker
          around, so everyone got a turn.</p></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-851" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1026" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1089" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1211" class="calibre"></a>If it’s culturally appropriate, use toys to stimulate
        participants’ minds or give them something to do with their hands.
        Simple toys can help inspire ideas. One team held a brainstorming
        session to establish the business objectives for their project. To
        start the day, I gave every participant some modeling clay and asked
        them to model their product vision using the clay&mdash;with no more
        instruction than that. It woke them up, got them thinking creatively,
        and they had some fun with it. We transitioned that energy into
        actually writing down a real vision for the product.</p></div><div class="book" title="Following up after elicitation"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2814">Following up after elicitation</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">After each elicitation activity is complete, there’s still a lot
        to do. You need to organize and share your notes, document open
        issues, and classify the newly gathered information. <a class="xref" title="Figure 7-6. Activities to follow up after an elicitation session." href="#calibre_link-159">Figure&nbsp;7-6</a> highlights the

          probably requires more effort than if you organized information as
          you encountered it during an independent elicitation activity.
          Consolidate your input from multiple sources. Review and update your
          notes soon after the session is complete, while the content is still
          fresh in your mind.</p><p class="calibre3">Editing the elicitation notes is a risk. You might be
          incorrectly remembering what something meant, thereby unknowingly
          changing the meaning. Keep a set of the raw notes to refer to later
          if necessary. Soon after each interview or workshop, share the
          consolidated notes with the participants and ask them to review them
          to ensure that they accurately represent the session. Early review
          is essential to successful requirements development because only
          those people who supplied the requirements can judge whether they
          were captured correctly. Hold additional discussions to resolve any
          inconsistencies and to fill in any blanks. Consider sharing the
          consolidated notes with other project stakeholders who weren’t
          present in the session, so that they are aware of progress. This
          gives them the opportunity to flag any issues or concerns
          immediately.</p></div><div class="book" title="Documenting open issues"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2817">Documenting open issues</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-825" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-921" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-925" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1084" class="calibre"></a>During elicitation activities, you might have
          encountered items that need to be further explored at a later date
          or knowledge gaps you need to close. Or you might have identified
          new questions while reviewing your notes. Examine any parking lots
          from elicitation sessions for issues that are still open and record
          them in an issue-tracking tool. For each issue, record any relevant
          notes related to resolving the issues, progress already made, an
          owner, and a due date. Consider using the same issue-tracking tool
          that the development and testing teams use.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Classifying customer input"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2818">Classifying customer input</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Don’t expect your customers to present a succinct, complete, and

        Anything that describes the financial, marketplace, or other business

        scenarios, or user stories (see <a class="xref" title="Chapter 8. Understanding user requirements" href="#calibre_link-35">Chapter&nbsp;8</a>). A user who says, “I
        need to &lt;do something&gt;” is probably describing a user
        requirement, as in the following examples:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">“I need to print a mailing label for a package.”</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">“As the lead machine operator, I need to calibrate the pump
            controller first thing every morning.”</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Business rules</strong></span> When a
        customer says that only certain users can perform an activity under
        specific conditions, he might be presenting a business rule (see <a class="xref" title="Chapter 9. Playing by the rules" href="#calibre_link-39">Chapter&nbsp;9</a>). These aren’t software requirements
        as they stand, but you might derive some functional requirements to
        enforce the rules. Phrases such as “Must comply with …,” “If &lt;some
        condition is true&gt;, then &lt;something happens&gt;,” or “Must be
        calculated according to … ” suggest that the user is describing a
        business rule. Here are some examples:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">“A new client must pay 30 percent of the estimated
            consulting fee and travel expenses in advance.”</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">“Time-off approvals must comply with the company’s HR
            vacation policy.”</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Functional requirements</strong></span>
        Functional requirements describe the observable behaviors the system
        will exhibit under certain conditions and the actions the system will
        let users take. Here are some examples of functional requirements as
        you might hear them from users:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">“If the pressure exceeds 40.0 psi, the high-pressure warning
            light should come on.”</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">“The user must be able to sort the project list in forward
            and reverse alphabetical order.”</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">These statements illustrate how users typically present
        functional requirements, but they don’t represent good ways to write
        functional requirements. The BA will need to craft these into more
        precise specifications. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 11. Writing excellent requirements" href="#calibre_link-59">Chapter&nbsp;11</a> for guidance on writing
        good functional requirements.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-877" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-964" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1203" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1389" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1828" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2421" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Quality attributes</strong></span>
        Statements that describe how well the system does something are
        quality attributes (see <a class="xref" title="Chapter 14. Beyond functionality" href="#calibre_link-40">Chapter&nbsp;14</a>).
        Listen for words that describe desirable system characteristics: fast,
        easy, user-friendly, reliable, secure. You’ll need to work with the
        users to understand just what they mean by these ambiguous and
        subjective terms so that you can write clear, verifiable quality
        goals. The following examples suggest what quality attributes might
        sound like when described by users:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">“The mobile software must respond quickly to touch
            commands.”</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">“The shopping cart mechanism has to be simple to use so my
            new customers don’t abandon the purchase.”</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">External interface
        requirements</strong></span> Requirements in this category describe the
        connections between your system and the rest of the universe. The SRS
        template in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 10. Documenting the requirements" href="#calibre_link-38">Chapter&nbsp;10</a> includes
        sections for interfaces to users, hardware, and other software
        systems. Phrases such as “Must read signals from …,” “Must send
        messages to …,” “Must be able to read files in &lt;format&gt;,” and
        “User interface elements must conform to &lt;a standard&gt;” indicate
        that the customer is describing an external interface requirement.
        Following are some examples:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">“The manufacturing execution system must control the wafer
            sorter.”</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">“The mobile app should send the check image to the bank
            after I photograph the check I’m depositing.”</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Constraints</strong></span> Design and
        implementation constraints legitimately restrict the options available
        to the developer (see <a class="xref" title="Chapter 14. Beyond functionality" href="#calibre_link-40">Chapter&nbsp;14</a>).
        Devices with embedded software often must respect physical constraints
        such as size, weight, and interface connections. Phrases that indicate
        that the customer is describing a design or implementation constraint
        include: “Must be written in &lt;a specific programming language&gt;,”
        “Cannot exceed &lt;some limit&gt;,” and “Must use &lt;a specific user
        interface control&gt;.” The following are examples of constraints that
        a customer might present:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">“Files submitted electronically cannot exceed 10 MB in
            size.”</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">“The browser must use 256-bit encryption for all secure
            transactions.”</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">As with functional requirements, don’t just transcribe the
        user’s statement of a constraint. Ask why the constraint exists,
        confirm its validity, and record the rationale for including it as a
        requirement.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Data requirements</strong></span> Customers
        are presenting a data requirement whenever they describe the format,
        data type, allowed values, or default value for a data element; the
        composition of a complex business data structure; or a report to be
        generated (see <a class="xref" title="Chapter 13. Specifying data requirements" href="#calibre_link-87">Chapter&nbsp;13</a>). Some
        examples of data requirements are as follows:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">“The ZIP code has five digits, followed by an optional
            hyphen and four digits that default to 0000.”</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">“An order consists of the customer’s identity, shipping
            information, and one or more products, each of which includes the
            product number, number of units, unit price, and total
            price.”</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1083" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1209" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2162" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Solution ideas</strong></span> Many
        “requirements” from users are really solution ideas. Someone who
        describes a specific way to interact with the system to perform some
        action is suggesting a solution. The business analyst needs to probe
        below the surface of a solution idea to get to the real requirement.
        Repeatedly asking “why” the user needs it to work this way will likely
        reveal the true need (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>). For instance,
        passwords are just one of several possible ways to implement a
        security requirement. Two other examples of solution ideas are the
        following:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">“Then I select the state where I want to send the package
            from a drop-down list.”</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">“The phone has to allow the user to swipe with a finger to
            navigate between screens.”</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">In the first example, the phrase <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">from a drop-down
        list</em></span> indicates that this is a solution idea because it’s
        describing a specific user interface control. The prudent BA will ask,
        “Why from a drop-down list?” If the user replies, “That just seemed
        like a good way to do it,” then the real requirement is something
        like, “The system shall permit the user to specify the state where he
        wants to send the package.” But maybe the user says, “We do the same
        thing in several other places and I want it to be consistent. Also,
        the drop-down list prevents the user from entering invalid data.”
        These are legitimate reasons to specify a specific solution.
        Recognize, though, that embedding a solution in a requirement imposes
        a design constraint on that requirement: it limits the requirement to
        being implemented in only one way. This isn’t necessarily wrong or
        bad; just make sure the constraint is there for a good reason.</p><p class="calibre3">Classifying the customer input is just the beginning of the
        process to create requirements specifications. You still need to
        assemble the information into clearly stated and well-organized
        requirements collections. As you work through the information, craft
        clear individual requirements and store them in the appropriate
        sections of the team’s document templates or repository. Make
        additional passes through this information to ensure that each
        statement demonstrates the characteristics of high-quality
        requirements as described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 11. Writing excellent requirements" href="#calibre_link-59">Chapter&nbsp;11</a>. As you process your
        elicitation notes, mark the items complete as you store them in the
        right place.</p></div><div class="book" title="How do you know when you’re done?"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2820">How do you know when you’re done?</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">No simple signal will indicate when you’ve completed
        requirements elicitation. In fact, you’ll never be entirely done,
        particularly if you are deliberately implementing a system
        incrementally, as on agile projects. As people muse in the shower each
        morning and talk with their colleagues, they’ll generate ideas for
        additional requirements and want to change some of the ones they
        already have. The following cues suggest that you’re reaching the
        point of diminishing returns on requirements elicitation, at least for
        now. Perhaps you are done if:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The users can’t think of any more use cases or user stories.
            Users tend to identify user requirements in sequence of decreasing

        sections in an SRS template. Despite your best efforts to discover
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">all</em></span> the requirements, you won’t, so expect to
        make changes as construction proceeds. Remember, your goal is to
        accumulate a shared understanding of requirements that is good enough
        to let construction of the next release or increment proceed at an
        acceptable level of risk.</p></div><div class="book" title="Some cautions about elicitation"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2821">Some cautions about elicitation</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Skill in conducting elicitation discussions comes with
        experience and builds on training in interviewing, group facilitation,
        conflict resolution, and similar activities. However, a few cautions
        will decrease the learning curve.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Balance stakeholder
        representation</strong></span> Collecting input from too few
        representatives or hearing the voice of only the loudest, most
        opinionated customer is a problem. It can lead to overlooking
        requirements that are important to certain user classes or to
        including requirements that don’t represent the needs of a majority of
        the users. The best balance involves a few product champions who can
        speak for their respective user classes, with each champion backed up
        by other representatives from the same user class.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Define scope appropriately</strong></span>
        During requirements elicitation, you might find that the project scope
        is improperly defined, being either too large or too small. If the
        scope is too large, you’ll accumulate more requirements than are
        needed to deliver adequate business and customer value, and the
        elicitation process will drag on. If the project is scoped too small,
        customers will present needs that are clearly important yet just as
        clearly lie beyond the limited scope currently established for the
        project. The current scope could be too small to yield a satisfactory
        product. Eliciting user requirements therefore can lead to modifying
        the product vision or the project scope.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Avoid the requirements-versus-design
        argument</strong></span> It’s often stated that requirements are about
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">what</em></span> the system has to do, whereas
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">how</em></span> the solution will be implemented is the realm
        of design. Although attractively concise, this is an
        oversimplification. Requirements elicitation should indeed focus on
        the <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">what</em></span>, but there’s a gray area&mdash;not a sharp
        line&mdash;between analysis and design (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>).
        Hypothetical <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">how</em></span>s help to clarify and refine the
        understanding of what users need. Analysis models, screen sketches,
        and prototypes help to make the needs expressed during elicitation
        more tangible and to reveal errors and omissions. Make it clear to
        users that these screens and prototypes are illustrative only, not
        necessarily the ultimate solution.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-624" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-844" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1077" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1371" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1756" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Research within
        reason</strong></span> The need to do exploratory research sometimes
        disrupts elicitation. An idea or a suggestion arises, but extensive
        research is required to assess whether it should even be considered
        for the product. Treat these explorations of feasibility or value as
        project tasks in their own right. Prototyping is one way to explore
        such issues. If your project requires extensive research, use an
        incremental development approach to explore the requirements in small,
        low-risk portions.</p></div><div class="book" title="Assumed and implied requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2822">Assumed and implied requirements</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">You will never document 100 percent of the requirements for a
        system. But the requirements you <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">don’t</em></span> specify
        pose a risk that the project might deliver a solution different from
        what stakeholders expect. Two likely culprits behind missed
        expectations are assumed and implied requirements:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Assumed requirements</em></span> are those that
            people expect without having explicitly expressed them. What you
            assume as being obvious might not be the same as assumptions that
            various developers make.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Implied requirements</em></span> are necessary
            because of another requirement but aren’t explicitly stated.
            Developers can’t implement functionality they don’t know
            about.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">To reduce these risks, try to identify knowledge gaps waiting to
        be filled with implied and assumed requirements. Ask, “What are we
        assuming?” during elicitation sessions to try to surface those hidden
        thoughts. If you come across an assumption during requirements
        discussions, record it and confirm its validity. People often assume
        that things have to be the way they’ve always been because they’re so
        familiar with an existing system or business process. If you’re
        developing a replacement system, review the previous system’s features
        to determine whether they’re truly required in the replacement.</p><p class="calibre3">To identify implied requirements, study the results of initial
        elicitation sessions to identify areas of incompleteness. Does a
        vague, high-level requirement need to be fleshed out so the
        stakeholders all understand it? Is a requirement that might be part of
        a logical set (say, saving an incomplete web form) lacking its
        counterpart (retrieving a saved form for further work)? You might need
        to re-interview some of the same stakeholders to have them look for
        missing requirements (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-161">[ref202]</a>). Also, think of new
        stakeholders who know the topic and can spot gaps.</p><p class="calibre3">Read between the lines to identify features or characteristics
        the customers expect to be included without having said so. Ask
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">context-free questions</em></span>, high-level and open-ended
        questions that elicit information about global characteristics of both
        the business problem and the potential solution (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-70">[ref082]</a>). The customer’s response to questions such as
        “What kind of precision is required in the product?” or “Can you help
        me understand why you don’t agree with Miguel’s reply?” can lead to
        insights that questions with standard yes/no or A/B/C answers do
        not.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2823" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">No assumed requirements</div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1096" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1249" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1290" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1491" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1535" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2319" class="calibre"></a>I once encountered a development team that was

          including upload, edit, and publish content to a website. There were
          approximately 1,000 pieces of existing content, organized in a
          hierarchy. The content management team assumed that users would be
          able to navigate the hierarchy to quickly find a specific piece of
          content. They did not specify requirements regarding the user
          interface navigation. However, when the developers implemented the
          user interface to navigate to content, they organized all of the
          content in a single level, not hierarchically, and showed only 20
          items per screen. To find a specific piece of content, a user might
          have to navigate through as many as 50 screens. A little more
          specification and dialogue between developers and the content
          management team could have avoided considerable rework.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Finding missing requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-329">Finding missing requirements</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Missing requirements constitute a common type of requirement

            percent of the total order price.” But what’s the shipping charge
            for an order with a price of exactly $100? It’s not specified, so

            It’s difficult to read a mass of text and notice the item that’s

            study a model and realize that there should be an arrow from one
            box to another; that missing arrow represents a missing
            requirement. Analysis models are described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 12. A picture is worth 1024 words" href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter&nbsp;12</a>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Sets of requirements with complex Boolean logic (ANDs, ORs,

      holding its first requirements elicitation workshop to learn what
      chemists would need to do with the system. The participants included a
      business analyst, Lori; the product champion for the chemists, Tim; two
      other chemist representatives, Sandy and Peter; and the lead developer,
      Ravi.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“Tim, Sandy, and Peter have identified 14 use cases that
      chemists would need to perform using the Chemical Tracking System,” Lori
      told the group. “You said the use case called ‘Request a Chemical’ is
      top priority and Tim already wrote a brief description for it, so let’s
      begin there. Tim, how do you visualize the process to request a chemical
      with the system?”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“First,” said Tim, “you should know that only people who
      have been authorized by their lab managers are allowed to request
      chemicals.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“Okay, that sounds like a business rule,” Lori replied.
      “I’ll start a list of business rules because we’ll probably find others.
      It looks like we’ll have to verify that the user is on the approved
      list.” Lori then guided the group through a discussion of how they
      envisioned creating a request for a new chemical. She used flipcharts
      and sticky notes to collect information about preconditions,
      postconditions, and the interactions between the user and the system.
      Lori asked how a session would be different if the user were requesting
      a chemical from a vendor rather than from the stockroom. She asked what
      could go wrong and how the system should handle each error condition.
      After about 30 minutes, the group had a solid handle on how a user would
      request a chemical. They moved on to the next use
      case.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">A necessary prerequisite to designing software that meets user
      needs is to understand what the users intend to do with it. Some teams
      take a product-centric approach. They focus on defining the features to
      implement in the software, with the hope that those features will appeal
      to prospective customers. In most cases, though, you’re better off
      taking a user-centric and usage-centric approach to requirements
      elicitation. Focusing on users and their anticipated usage helps reveal
      the necessary functionality, avoids implementing features that no one
      will use, and assists with prioritization.</p><p class="calibre3">User requirements are found in the second level of requirements
      that you saw in <a class="xref" title="Figure 1-1. Relationships among several types of requirements information. Solid arrows mean “are stored in”; dotted arrows mean “are the origin of” or “influence.”" href="#calibre_link-29">Figure&nbsp;1-1</a> in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 1. The essential software requirement" href="#calibre_link-21">Chapter&nbsp;1</a>. They lie between the
      business requirements that set the objectives for the project and the
      functional requirements that describe what developers must implement.
      This chapter addresses two of the most commonly employed techniques for
      exploring user requirements: use cases and user stories.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-556" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2381" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2401" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2411" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2827" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2471" class="calibre"></a>Analysts have long employed usage scenarios to elicit user
      requirements (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-163">[ref004]</a>). The usage-centered perspective
      was formalized into the use case approach to requirements modeling
      (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-164">[ref126]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-165">[ref041]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-33">[ref146]</a>). More recently, proponents of agile development
      introduced the concept of a “user story,” a concise statement that
      articulates a user need and serves as a starting point for conversations
      to flesh out the details (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-34">[ref043]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3">Both use cases and user stories shift from the product-centric
      perspective of requirements elicitation to discussing what
      <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">users</em></span> need to accomplish, in contrast to asking
      users what they want the <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">system</em></span> to do. The intent
      of this approach is to describe tasks that users will need to perform
      with the system, or user-system interactions that will result in a
      valuable outcome for some stakeholder. That understanding leads the BA
      to derive the necessary functionality that must be implemented to enable
      those usage scenarios. It also leads to tests to verify whether the
      functionality was implemented correctly. Usage-centric elicitation
      strategies will bring you closer to understanding the user’s
      requirements on many classes of projects than any other technique we
      have used.</p><p class="calibre3">Use cases and user stories work well for exploring the
      requirements for business applications, websites, kiosks, and systems
      that let a user control a piece of hardware. However, they are
      inadequate for understanding the requirements of certain types of
      applications. Applications such as batch processes, computationally
      intensive systems, business analytics, and data warehousing might have
      just a few use cases. The complexity of these applications lies in the
      computations performed, the data found and compiled, or the reports
      generated, not in the user-system interactions.</p><p class="calibre3">Nor are use cases and user stories sufficient for specifying many
      embedded and other real-time systems. Consider an automated car wash.
      The driver of the car has just one goal&mdash;to wash the car&mdash;with perhaps a
      few options: underbody spray, sealer wax, polish. However, the car wash
      has a lot going on. It has a drive mechanism to move your car; numerous
      motors, pumps, valves, switches, dials, and lights; and timers or
      sensors to control the activation of these physical components. You also
      have to worry about diagnostic functionality, such as notifying the
      operator when a tank of liquid is nearly empty, as well as fault
      detection and safety requirements. What happens if the drive mechanism
      fails while a car is in the tunnel, or if the motor on a blower fails? A
      requirements technique often used for real-time systems is to list the
      external events to which the system must react and the corresponding
      system responses. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 12. A picture is worth 1024 words" href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter&nbsp;12</a>
      for more about event analysis.</p><div class="book" title="Use cases and user stories"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2828">Use cases and user stories</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">A <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">use case</em></span> describes a sequence of
        interactions between a system and an external actor that results in
        the actor being able to achieve some outcome of value. The names of
        use cases are always written in the form of a verb followed by an
        object. Select strong, descriptive names to make it evident from the
        name that the use case will deliver something valuable for some user.

        simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the
        person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of
        the system” (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-104">[ref045]</a>). User stories often are
        written according to the following template, although other styles
        also are used:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">As a &lt;type of user&gt;, I want &lt;some goal&gt;
          so that &lt;some reason&gt;.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">Using this template provides an advantage over the even shorter
        use case name because, although they both state the user’s goal, the
        user story also identifies the user class and the rationale behind the
        request for that system capability. These are valuable additions. The
        user class&mdash;which need not be a human being&mdash;in a user story corresponds
        to the primary actor in a use case (described later in this chapter).
        The rationale could be provided in the brief description of the use
        case. <a class="xref" title="Table 8-2. Some sample use cases and corresponding user stories" href="#calibre_link-167">Table&nbsp;8-2</a> shows

        Both are focused on understanding what different types of users need
        to accomplish through interactions with a software system. However,
        the two processes move in different directions from these similar
        starting points, as illustrated in <a class="xref" title="Figure 8-1. How user requirements lead to functional requirements and tests with the use case approach and the user story approach." href="#calibre_link-168">Figure&nbsp;8-1</a>. Both approaches
        can also produce other deliverables, such as visual analysis models,
        but <a class="xref" title="Figure 8-1. How user requirements lead to functional requirements and tests with the use case approach and the user story approach." href="#calibre_link-168">Figure&nbsp;8-1</a>
        illustrates the core distinction.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-168" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2829" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000033.jpeg" alt="An illustration with two parts, top and bottom.

          tests with the use case approach and the user story
          approach.</div></div><p class="calibre3">With use cases, the next step is for the BA to work with user
        representatives to understand how they imagine a dialog taking place
        with the system to perform the use case. The BA structures the
        information collected according to a use case template; you’ll see an
        example later in the chapter. The template contains numerous spaces in
        which to store information that can provide a rich understanding of
        the use case, its variants, and related information. It’s not
        necessary to fully complete the template if the developers can get the
        information they need from a briefer specification, but referring to
        the template during elicitation will help the participants discover
        all the pertinent information. From the use case specification, the BA
        can derive the functional requirements that developers must implement,
        and a tester can identify tests to judge whether the use case was
        properly implemented. Developers might implement an entire use case in
        a single release or iteration. Alternatively, they might implement
        just a portion of a particular use case initially, either for size or
        priority reasons, and then implement additional parts in future
        releases.</p><p class="calibre3">As employed on agile projects, a user story serves as a
        placeholder for future conversations that need to take place on a
        just-in-time basis among developers, customer representatives, and a
        business analyst (if one is working on the project). Those
        conversations reveal the additional information that developers must
        know to be able to implement the story. Refining the user stories
        through conversations leads to a collection of smaller, focused
        stories that describe individual chunks of system functionality. User
        stories that are too large to implement in one agile development
        iteration (called <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">epics</em></span>) are split into smaller
        stories that can be implemented within a single iteration. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 20. Agile projects" href="#calibre_link-25">Chapter&nbsp;20</a> for more about epics and user
        stories.</p><p class="calibre3">Rather than specifying functional requirements, agile teams
        typically elaborate a refined user story into a set of acceptance
        tests that collectively describe the story’s “conditions of
        satisfaction.” Thinking about tests at this early stage is an
        excellent idea for all projects, regardless of their development
        approach. Test thinking helps you identify variations of the basic
        user story (or use case), exception conditions that must be handled,
        and nonfunctional requirements such as performance and security
        considerations. If the developer implements the necessary code to
        satisfy the acceptance tests&mdash;and hence to meet conditions of
        satisfaction&mdash;the user story is considered to be correctly
        implemented.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-558" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1183" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2377" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2413" class="calibre"></a>User stories provide a concise statement of a user’s
        needs. Use cases dive further into describing how the user imagines
        interacting with the system to accomplish his objective. The use case
        should not get into design specifics, just into the user’s mental
        image about the interaction. User stories offer the advantage of
        simplicity and conciseness, but there is a tradeoff. Use cases provide
        project participants with a structure and context that a collection of
        user stories lacks. They provide an organized way for the BA to lead
        elicitation discussions beyond simply collecting a list of things that
        users need to achieve with the system as a starting point for planning
        and discussion.</p><p class="calibre3">Not everyone is convinced that user stories are an adequate
        requirements solution for large or more demanding projects (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-169">[ref087]</a>). You can examine each element of a use case
        (flows, preconditions, postconditions, and so on) to look for
        pertinent functional and nonfunctional requirements and to derive
        tests. This helps you avoid overlooking any requirements that
        developers must implement to let users perform the use case. But user
        stories do not replicate that structure and rigor, so it’s easier for
        the team to miss some acceptance tests. A BA or developer must have
        experience in effective user story development to avoid overlooking
        relevant functionality. A use-case analysis might reveal that several
        use cases involve similar exceptions (or other commonalities) that
        could perhaps be implemented as a single consistent error-handling
        strategy within the application. Such commonalities are more difficult
        to discern with a collection of user stories.</p><p class="calibre3">For more information about how to elicit and apply user stories

        chapter will focus on the use case technique, pointing out
        similarities and contrasts with the user story approach where

        interactions between a system and an external actor that results in
        some outcome that provides value to the actor. An
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">actor</em></span> is a person (or sometimes another software
        system or a hardware device) that interacts with the system to perform
        a use case. For example, the Chemical Tracking System’s “Request a
        Chemical” use case involves an actor named
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Requester</em></span>. There is no CTS user class named
        Requester. Both chemists and members of the chemical stockroom staff
        may request chemicals, so members of either user class may perform the
        Requester role. Following are some questions you might ask to help
        user representatives identify actors:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Who (or what) is notified when something occurs within the
            system?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Who (or what) provides information or services to the
            system?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Who (or what) helps the system respond to and complete a
            task?</p></li></ul></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2831" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Users and actors</div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1675" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2106" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2363" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2383" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2407" class="calibre"></a>The distinction between users and actors can get
          confusing (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>). Think of a human user as
          having a collection of hats available, each labeled with the name of
          an actor that the system will recognize as participating in certain
          use cases. When the user wants to perform a certain action with the
          system, he puts on the appropriate hat. The system will recognize
          that person as the labeled actor when he launches whatever use case
          he’s interested in performing. When a chemist wants to request a
          chemical, he puts on his Requester cap, and the Chemical Tracking
          System will think of him as a Requester, no matter what his real job
          title is. That is, the user is playing the role of a Requester at
          that moment. A member of the chemical stockroom staff also has a hat
          labeled Requester. Both chemists and chemical stockroom people have
          an assortment of other hats labeled with different actor names that
          the CTS knows about. Well, okay, they don’t really have all those
          hats, but this is a helpful way to think about it. Users are actual
          people (or systems); actors are abstractions.</p></div><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Use case diagrams</em></span> provide a high-level
        visual representation of the user requirements. <a class="xref" title="Figure 8-2. Partial use case diagram for the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-170">Figure&nbsp;8-2</a> shows a partial
        use case diagram for the CTS, using the Unified Modeling Language
        (UML) notation (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-171">[ref025]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-172">[ref188]</a>).
        The box frame represents the system boundary. Arrows from each actor
        (stick figure) connect to the use cases (ovals) with which the actor
        interacts. An arrow from an actor to a use case indicates that he is
        the <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">primary actor</em></span> for the use case. The primary
        actor initiates the use case and derives the main value from it. An
        arrow goes from a use case to a <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">secondary actor</em></span>,
        who participates somehow in the successful execution of the use case.
        Other software systems often serve as secondary actors, contributing
        behind the scenes to the use case execution. The Training Database is
        just such a secondary actor in <a class="xref" title="Figure 8-2. Partial use case diagram for the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-170">Figure&nbsp;8-2</a>. This system
        gets involved when a Requester is requesting a hazardous chemical that
        requires the Requester to have been trained in how to safely handle
        such dangerous materials.</p><p class="calibre3">Compare this use case diagram to the context diagram shown
        earlier in <a class="xref" title="Figure 5-6. Partial context diagram for the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-124">Figure&nbsp;5-6</a>
        in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 5. Establishing the business requirements" href="#calibre_link-32">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>. Both
        define the scope boundary between objects that lie outside the system
        and things inside the system. In the use case diagram, the box
        separates some internal aspects of the system&mdash;use cases&mdash;from the
        external actors. The context diagram also depicts objects that lie
        outside the system, but it provides no visibility into the system
        internals. The arrows in a context diagram indicate the flow of data,
        control signals, or physical materials (if you defined the “system” to
        include manual processes) across the system boundary. In contrast, the
        arrows in a use case diagram simply indicate the connections between
        actors and use cases in which they participate; they do not represent
        a flow of any kind. As with all forms of requirements representations,
        all readers of the models you create must have a consistent
        understanding of the notations used.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-170" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2832" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000034.jpeg" alt="Partial use case diagram for the Chemical Tracking System." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;8-2.&nbsp;Partial use case diagram for the Chemical Tracking

          that an actor can perform to achieve some outcome of value. A use
          case might encompass a number of related activities having a common
          goal. A <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">scenario</em></span> is a description of a single
          instance of usage of the system. A use case is therefore a
          collection of related usage scenarios, and a scenario is a specific
          instance of a use case. When exploring user requirements, you can
          begin with a general use case statement and develop more specific
          usage scenarios, or you can generalize from a specific scenario
          example to the broader use case.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 8-3. Partial specification of the Chemical Tracking System’s “Request a Chemical” use case." href="#calibre_link-173">Figure&nbsp;8-3</a>

          drawn from the Chemical Tracking System. <a class="xref" title="Appendix D. Sample requirements documents" href="#calibre_link-116">Appendix&nbsp;D</a> shows more sample use
          cases written according to this template. As with all templates, you
          don’t complete this from top to bottom, and you don’t necessarily
          need all of the template information for every use case. The
          template is simply a structure in which to store the information you
          encounter during a use case discussion in an organized and
          consistent fashion. The template reminds you of all the information
          you should contemplate regarding each use case. If information that
          belongs in the template already exists somewhere else, simply point
          to it to include that information by reference. For instance, don’t
          incorporate the actual text of each business rule that affects the
          use case in the template; just list the identifiers for the relevant
          business rules so the reader can find that information when

            packets of information: normal and alternative flows, exceptions,
            preconditions and postconditions, and so on. The example in <a class="xref" title="Figure 8-3. Partial specification of the Chemical Tracking System’s “Request a Chemical” use case." href="#calibre_link-173">Figure&nbsp;8-3</a> illustrates
            a simple labeling convention that can help keep these elements
            straight. Each use case has a sequence number and a meaningful
            name that reflects the user’s goal: UC-4 Request a Chemical. The
            identifier for the normal flow for this use case is 4.0.
            Alternative flows are identified by incrementing the number to the
            right of the decimal, so the first alternative flow is 4.1, a
            second would be 4.2, and so on. Both the normal flow and
            alternative flows can have their own exceptions. The first
            exception on the normal flow of use case number 4 would be labeled
            4.0.E1. The second exception for the first alternative flow for
            this use case would be 4.1.E2.</p></div><div class="book" title="Preconditions and postconditions"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2836">Preconditions and postconditions</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Preconditions</em></span> define prerequisites that
            must be met before the system can begin executing the use case.
            The system should be able to test all preconditions to see if it’s
            possible to proceed with the use case. Preconditions could
            describe the system state (for a use case to withdraw cash from an
            automated teller machine, the ATM must contain money), but they
            don’t describe the user’s intent (“I need some cash”).</p><p class="calibre3">When the system detects the trigger event that indicates
            that a user wants to execute a particular use case, the system
            says to itself (though not necessarily to the user!), “Hold on a
            moment while I check these preconditions.” The trigger event
            itself is not one of the preconditions. If the preconditions are
            all satisfied, the system can begin executing the use case;
            otherwise, it cannot. Checking preconditions can prevent some
            errors that might otherwise take place if the system knows at the
            outset that it can’t successfully complete the use case but
            proceeds anyway. If the ATM is empty, it shouldn’t let a user even
            begin a withdrawal transaction. This is a way to make your
            applications more robust. Users aren’t likely to be aware of all
            of a use case’s preconditions, so the BA might need to get some
            input from other sources.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Postconditions</em></span> describe the state of
            the system after the use case executed successfully.
            Postconditions can describe:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Something observable to the user (the system displayed
                an account balance).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Physical outcomes (the ATM has dispensed money and
                printed a receipt).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Internal system state changes (the account has been
                debited by the amount of a cash withdrawal, plus any
                transaction fees).</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Many postconditions are evident to the user, because they
            reflect the outcome that delivers user value: “I’ve got my cash!”
            However, no user will ever tell a BA that the system should reduce
            its record of the amount of cash remaining in the ATM by the
            amount the user just withdrew. Users neither know nor care about
            such internal housekeeping details. But developers and testers
            need to know about them, which means that the BA needs to discover
            those&mdash;perhaps by working with a subject matter expert&mdash;and record
            them as additional postconditions.</p></div><div class="book" title="Normal flows, alternative flows, and exceptions"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2837">Normal flows, alternative flows, and exceptions</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-595" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-604" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1180" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1185" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1584" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2107" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2391" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2412" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2472" class="calibre"></a>One scenario is identified as the <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">normal

            main flow, basic flow, normal course, primary scenario, main
            success scenario, sunny-day scenario, and happy path. The normal
            flow for the “Request a Chemical” use case is to request a
            chemical that’s available in the chemical stockroom. As <a class="xref" title="Figure 8-3. Partial specification of the Chemical Tracking System’s “Request a Chemical” use case." href="#calibre_link-173">Figure&nbsp;8-3</a> illustrates,
            the normal flow is written as a numbered list of steps, indicating
            which entity&mdash;the system or a specific actor&mdash;performs each
            step.</p><p class="calibre3">Other success scenarios within the use case are called
            <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">alternative flows</em></span> or <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">secondary
            scenarios</em></span>. Alternative flows deliver the same business
            outcome (sometimes with variations) as the normal flow but
            represent less common or lower-priority variations in the
            specifics of the task or how it is accomplished. The normal flow
            can branch off into an alternative flow at some decision point in
            the dialog sequence; it might (or might not) rejoin the normal
            flow later. The steps in the normal flow indicate where the user
            can branch into an alternative flow. A user who says, “The default
            should be…” is describing the normal flow of the use case. A
            statement such as “The user should also be able to request a
            chemical from a vendor” suggests an alternative flow, shown as 4.1
            in <a class="xref" title="Figure 8-3. Partial specification of the Chemical Tracking System’s “Request a Chemical” use case." href="#calibre_link-173">Figure&nbsp;8-3</a>,
            which branches from step 4 in the normal flow.</p><p class="calibre3">Recall that user stories are concise statements of user
            needs, in contrast to the richer description that a use case
            provides. In the agile world, a user story sometimes covers the
            same scope as an entire use case, but in other cases a user story
            represents just a single scenario or alternative flow. If an agile
            development team were discussing requirements for the CTS, they
            might come up with user stories such as the following:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">As a chemist, I want to request a chemical so
              that I can perform experiments.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">As a chemist, I want to request a chemical from
              the Chemical Stockroom so that I can use it
              immediately.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">As a chemist, I want to request a chemical from
              a vendor because I don’t trust the purity of any of the samples
              available in the Chemical Stockroom.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">The first of these three stories corresponds to the use case
            as a whole. The second and third user stories represent the normal
            flow of the use case and the first alternative flow, from <a class="xref" title="Figure 8-3. Partial specification of the Chemical Tracking System’s “Request a Chemical” use case." href="#calibre_link-173">Figure&nbsp;8-3</a>.</p><p class="calibre3">Conditions that have the potential to prevent a use case
            from succeeding are called <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">exceptions</em></span>.
            Exceptions describe anticipated error conditions that could occur
            during execution of the use case and how they are to be handled.
            In some cases, the user can recover from an exception, perhaps by
            re-entering some data that was incorrect. In other situations,
            though, the use case must terminate without reaching its success
            conditions. One exception for the “Request a Chemical” use case is
            “Chemical Is Not Commercially Available,” labeled as 4.1.E1 in
            <a class="xref" title="Figure 8-3. Partial specification of the Chemical Tracking System’s “Request a Chemical” use case." href="#calibre_link-173">Figure&nbsp;8-3</a>. If
            you don’t specify exception handling during requirements
            elicitation, there are two possible outcomes:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-542" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-551" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1262" class="calibre"></a>Each developer will make his best guess at how
                to deal with the exceptions he sees, leading to inconsistent
                error handling throughout the application and less robust
                software.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The system will fail when a user hits the error
                condition because no one thought about it.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">It’s a safe bet that system crashes aren’t on the user’s
            list of requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">Some error conditions could affect multiple use cases or
            multiple steps in a use case’s normal flow. Examples are a loss of
            network connectivity, a database failure partway through an
            operation, or a physical device failure such as a paper jam. Treat
            these as additional functional requirements to be implemented,
            instead of repeating them as exceptions for all the potentially
            affected use cases. The goal is not to force-fit all known
            functionality into a use case. You’re employing usage-centric
            elicitation to try to discover as much of the essential system
            functionality as you can.</p><p class="calibre3">You won’t necessarily implement every alternative flow that
            you identify for a use case. You might defer some to later
            iterations or releases. However, you <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">must</em></span>
            implement the exceptions that can prevent the flows that you do
            implement from succeeding. Experienced programmers know that
            handling exceptions represents a lot of the coding effort.
            Overlooked exceptions are a common source of missing requirements.
            Specifying exception conditions during requirements elicitation
            helps teams build robust products. The steps in the normal flow
            indicate where known exceptions could take place, pointing to the
            section in the use case template for how the system should handle
            the exception.</p><p class="calibre3">Agile projects employing the user story approach address
            exceptions through the acceptance tests they create for each
            story. The third user story above pertained to requesting a
            chemical from a vendor. Conversations about this story might raise
            questions such as, “What if the chemical you want is not
            commercially available from any vendor?” This could lead to an
            acceptance test like, “If the chemical isn’t found in any
            available vendor catalogs, show a message to that effect.” As with
            any good testing approach, the set of acceptance tests for a user
            story must cover both expected behavior and things that could go
            wrong.</p><p class="calibre3">Although many use cases can be described in simple prose, a
            flowchart or a UML activity diagram is a useful way to visually
            represent the logic flow in a complex use case, as illustrated in
            <a class="xref" title="Figure 8-4. An activity diagram illustrating the step sequence in the normal and alternative flows of a use case." href="#calibre_link-174">Figure&nbsp;8-4</a>.
            Flowcharts and activity diagrams show the decision points and
            conditions that cause a branch from the normal flow into an
            alternative flow.</p><p class="calibre3">In the example in <a class="xref" title="Figure 8-3. Partial specification of the Chemical Tracking System’s “Request a Chemical” use case." href="#calibre_link-173">Figure&nbsp;8-3</a>, the actor’s
            ultimate goal&mdash;to request a chemical&mdash;is the same in both
            situations. Therefore, requesting a chemical from the stockroom or
            from a vendor are two scenarios within the same use case, not
            separate use cases. Some of the steps in an alternative flow will
            be the same as those in the normal flow, but certain unique
            actions are needed to accomplish the alternative path. This
            alternative flow might allow the user to search vendor catalogs
            for a desired chemical, then rejoin the normal flow and continue
            with the requesting process back at step 4.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-174" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2838" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000036.jpeg" alt="An illustration showing the normal flow of a use                   case in the left part of the figure.

            Card,” both of which might involve the user writing a check to
            make the payment. You can create a separate use case called “Write
            a Check” that contains the common steps involved in writing the
            check. The two transaction use cases both include the “Write a

            of use cases into a “macro” use case that describes a larger task.
            Some use cases for an e-commerce website might be “Search
            Catalog,” “Add Item to Shopping Cart,” and “Pay for Items in
            Shopping Cart.” If you could perform each of these activities
            independently, they are individual use cases. That is, you could
            have one session with the website in which you just searched the
            catalog, a second session in which you just added an item to your
            shopping cart without searching (perhaps by typing in the product
            number), and a third session in which you paid for the items in
            the shopping cart (implying that your cart must persist across
            logon sessions). However, you might also be able to perform all
            three activities in sequence as a single large use case called
            “Buy Product,” as shown in <a class="xref" title="Figure 8-7. Preconditions and postconditions define the boundaries of the individual use cases that can be chained together to perform a larger task." href="#calibre_link-178">Figure&nbsp;8-7</a>. The
            description of the “Buy Product” use case could simply say to
            perform each of those other three use cases in turn: “Search
            Catalog,” “Add Item to Shopping Cart,” and then “Pay for Items in
            Shopping Cart.”</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-178" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2845" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000039.gif" alt="Preconditions and postconditions define the boundaries of the individual use cases that can be chained together to perform a larger task." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;8-7.&nbsp;Preconditions and postconditions define the boundaries of

            system in a state that enables the user to commence the next use
            case immediately. That is, the postconditions of one use case must
            satisfy the preconditions of the next one in the sequence.
            Similarly, in a transaction-processing application such as an ATM,
            each use case must leave the system in a state that permits the
            next transaction to begin.</p></div><div class="book" title="Use cases and business rules"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2846">Use cases and business rules</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Use cases and business rules are intertwined. Some business
            rules constrain which roles can perform all or parts of a use
            case. Perhaps only users who have certain privilege levels can
            perform specific alternative flows. That is, the rule might impose
            preconditions that the system must test before letting the user
            proceed. Business rules can influence specific steps in the normal
            flow by defining valid input values or dictating how computations
            are to be performed. Suppose an airline charges a premium for
            passengers who want certain preferred seats. If the passenger
            executes a use case to select a new seat on the airline’s website,
            the relevant business rules would change the passenger’s airfare
            if he chooses one of those seats. When specifying a use case,
            record the identifiers of any known business rules that affect the
            use case, and indicate which part of the use case each rule
            affects.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2389" class="calibre"></a>While you are exploring use cases you might uncover
            pertinent business rules. When the chemists who participated in
            requirements elicitation for the Chemical Tracking System
            discussed the use case to view an order stored in the system, one
            of them said, “Fred shouldn’t be able to see my orders, and I
            don’t want to see Fred’s orders.” That is, they came up with a
            business rule: a user may view only chemical orders that he
            placed. Sometimes you invent business rules during elicitation and
            analysis, sometimes your discussions reveal relevant rules that
            already exist in the organization, and sometimes you already know
            about existing rules that the system will have to respect.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Identifying use cases"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2847">Identifying use cases</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">You can identify use cases in several ways (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-179">[ref100]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-180">[ref147]</a>):</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Identify the actors first, then lay out the business

          described in the next several sections of this chapter. The three
          business analysts facilitated a series of two-hour use case
          elicitation workshops, which were held twice a week. They chose to
          use workshops for elicitation partly because none of them had tried
          the use case method before, so they needed to learn together. Also,
          they saw the value of group synergy in the workshop format over
          individual interviews. Members of the various user classes
          participated in separate, parallel workshops, working with different
          BAs. This worked well because only a few use cases were common to
          multiple user classes. Each workshop included the user class’s
          product champion, other selected user representatives, and a
          developer. Participating in elicitation workshops gives developers
          early insight into the product they will be expected to build.
          Developers also serve as the voice of reality when infeasible
          requirements are suggested.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1668" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1672" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2385" class="calibre"></a>Prior to beginning the workshops, each BA asked the
          users to think of tasks they would need to perform with the new
          system. Each of these tasks became a candidate use case. This is a
          bottom-up approach to use case elicitation, which complements the
          top-down strategy of identifying all the business processes the
          system will support and gleaning use cases from those. Comparing the
          lists of use cases generated from these different thought processes
          reduces the chance of overlooking one.</p><p class="calibre3">A few candidates were judged to be out of scope and weren’t
          pursued. As the group explored the remaining in-scope use cases in
          the workshops, they found that some of them were related scenarios
          that could be consolidated into a single, more general use case. The
          group also discovered additional use cases beyond those in the
          initial set. Expect to perform these sorts of adjustments as you go
          along.</p><p class="calibre3">Some users proposed use cases that were not phrased as tasks,
          such as “Material Safety Data Sheet.” A use case’s name should
          indicate a goal the user wants to accomplish, so you need to start
          with a verb. Does the user want to request, view, print, download,
          order, revise, delete, or create a material safety data sheet?
          Sometimes a suggested use case was just a single step the actor
          would perform as part of process, such as “Scan Bar Code.” The BA
          needs to learn what objective the user has in mind that involves
          scanning a bar code. The BA might ask, “When you scan the bar code
          on the chemical container, what are you trying to accomplish?”
          Suppose the reply is, “As a chemist, I need to scan the container’s
          bar code so I can log the chemical into my laboratory.” (Note how
          this is stated in the style of a user story.) The real use case,
          therefore, is “Log Chemical into Lab.” Scanning the bar code label
          is just one step in the interaction between the actor and the system
          that logs the chemical into the lab.</p><p class="calibre3">Don’t dive into high-resolution analysis of the first use case
          that someone proposes. Learn just enough about each use case so the
          team can prioritize them and do an initial allocation of use cases,
          or portions thereof, to forthcoming releases or iterations. Then you
          can begin exploring the highest-priority use cases, those that are
          allocated to the next development cycle, so developers can begin
          implementing them as soon as possible. Lower-priority use cases can
          wait for detailing until just before they’re scheduled to be
          implemented. This is the same strategy you would pursue when working
          with user stories on an agile project.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-2848" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Don’t try to force every requirement to fit into a use case.
            Use cases can reveal most&mdash;but probably not all&mdash;of the functional
            requirements. If the BA already knows of certain functionality
            that must be implemented, there’s little value in creating a use
            case simply to hold that functionality.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Exploring use cases"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2849">Exploring use cases</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The participants in the CTS elicitation workshops began each
          use case discussion by identifying the actor who would benefit from
          the use case and writing the short description. Estimating the
          frequency of use provided an early indicator of concurrent usage and
          capacity requirements. Then they began defining the preconditions
          and postconditions, which are the boundaries of the use case; all
          use case steps take place between these boundaries. The
          preconditions and postconditions were adjusted as more information
          surfaced during the discussion.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1186" class="calibre"></a>Next, the BA asked the participants how they
          envisioned interacting with the system to perform the task. The
          resulting sequence of actor actions and system responses became the
          normal flow for the use case. Although each participant had a
          different mental image of what the future user interface would look
          like, the group reached a common vision of the essential steps in
          the actor-system dialog.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2850" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Staying in bounds</div><p class="calibre3">While reviewing a use case whose normal flow had eight
            steps, I realized that the postconditions were satisfied after
            step 5. Steps 6, 7, and 8 therefore were unnecessary, being
            outside the boundary of the use case. Similarly, a use case’s
            preconditions must be satisfied prior to commencing step 1 of the
            normal flow. When you review a use case flow, make sure that its
            preconditions and postconditions properly frame it.</p></div><p class="calibre3">The BA captured the actor actions and their corresponding
          system responses on sticky notes, which he placed on a flipchart
          sheet. Sticky notes work well for such workshops. It’s easy to move
          them around, group them together, and replace them as the discussion
          progresses. Another way to conduct such a workshop is to project a
          use case template onto a large screen from a computer and populate
          the template during the discussion. The elicitation team developed
          similar dialogs for the alternative flows and exceptions. Many
          exceptions were discovered when the analyst asked questions similar
          to “What should happen if the database isn’t online at that moment?”
          or “What if the chemical isn’t commercially available?” The workshop
          is also a good time to discuss the user’s expectations of quality,
          such as response times and availability, security requirements, and
          UI design constraints.</p><p class="calibre3">After the workshop participants described each use case and no
          one proposed additional variations, exceptions, or other
          information, they moved on to another one. They didn’t try to cover
          all the use cases in one marathon workshop or to pin down every
          detail of every use case they discussed. Instead, they explored the
          use cases in layers, beginning with the broad strokes for the
          top-priority use cases and iteratively refining them just prior to
          implementation.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 8-8. Use case elicitation work products." href="#calibre_link-181">Figure&nbsp;8-8</a> shows

          language that refers to specific user interface interactions.
          “Requester specifies the desired chemical” is nicely general and
          UI-independent. It allows for multiple ways to accomplish the user’s
          intention of indicating the chemical to be requested: enter a
          chemical ID number, import a chemical structure from a file, draw
          the structure on the screen with the mouse (or a stylus on a
          tablet), or select a chemical from a list. Proceeding too quickly
          into specific interaction details constrains the thinking of the
          workshop participants.</p><p class="calibre3">Use cases often involve some additional information or
          requirements that do not fit within any of the template sections.
          Use the “Other Information” section to record pertinent performance
          and other quality requirements, constraints, and external interface
          knowledge. Eventually, all this information should find a home in
          the SRS or other elements of your requirements documentation. Also
          note any information that might not be visible to the users, such as
          the need for one system to communicate behind the scenes with
          another to complete the use case.</p></div><div class="book" title="Validating use cases"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2852">Validating use cases</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The process in <a class="xref" title="Figure 8-8. Use case elicitation work products." href="#calibre_link-181">Figure&nbsp;8-8</a> shows that after
          each workshop, the BAs on the Chemical Tracking System derived
          software functional requirements from the use cases. (For more about
          this, see the next section, <a class="xref" title="Use cases and functional requirements" href="#calibre_link-182">Use cases and functional requirements</a>.) The BAs also
          drew some analysis models, such as a state-transition diagram that
          showed all possible chemical request statuses and the permitted
          status changes. Multiple use cases can manipulate a chemical
          request, so the diagram pulls together information and operations
          that span several use cases. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 12. A picture is worth 1024 words" href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter&nbsp;12</a> illustrates several
          analysis models for the CTS; the state-transition diagram is in

          and functional requirements to the workshop participants, who
          reviewed them prior to the next workshop. These informal reviews
          revealed many errors: previously undiscovered alternative flows, new
          exceptions, incorrect functional requirements, and missing dialog
          steps. The team quickly learned to allow at least one day between
          successive workshops. The mental relaxation that comes after a day
          or two away allows people to examine their earlier work from a fresh
          perspective. One BA who held daily workshops found that the
          participants had difficulty spotting errors in the materials they
          reviewed because the information was too fresh in their minds. They
          mentally recited the recent discussion and didn’t see the
          errors.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-2853" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-543" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1306" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2388" class="calibre"></a>Don’t wait until requirements specification is
            complete to solicit review feedback from users, developers, and
            other stakeholders. Early reviews help improve the subsequent
            requirements work.</p></div><p class="calibre3">Early in requirements development, the Chemical Tracking
          System’s test lead began creating conceptual tests&mdash;independent of
          implementation and user-interface specifics&mdash;from the use cases
          (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-184">[ref046]</a>). These tests helped the team reach a
          shared understanding of how the system should behave in specific
          scenarios. The tests let the BAs verify whether they had derived the
          functionality needed to let users perform each use case. During the
          final elicitation workshop, the participants walked through the
          tests together to be sure they agreed on how the use cases should
          work.</p><p class="calibre3">Early conceptual test thinking like this is much cheaper and
          faster than writing code, building part of the system, executing
          tests, and only then discovering problems with requirements. It is
          analogous to the agile approach of fleshing out user stories with
          acceptance tests, but the CTS team wrote both functional
          requirements and tests. Comparing the two revealed errors in both
          before any code was written. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 17. Validating the requirements" href="#calibre_link-60">Chapter&nbsp;17</a> discusses generating tests
          from requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">The CTS team created multiple representations of the
          requirements they identified: a list of functional requirements, a
          set of corresponding tests, and analysis models, all based on use
          cases. Comparing these alternative views of the requirements is a
          powerful quality technique (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>). The team
          used the tests to verify the functional requirements, looking for
          tests that couldn’t be “executed” with the set of requirements and
          for requirements that were not covered by tests.</p><p class="calibre3">If you create just a single representation, or view, of the
          requirements, you must trust it. You have nothing to compare it
          against to look for errors, gaps, and different interpretations.
          Agile project teams do not typically document functional
          requirements, preferring to create acceptance tests. Although
          thinking about testing during requirements exploration is an
          excellent idea on every project, it still leaves you with only a
          single representation of the requirements that you must trust as
          being correct. Similarly, traditional project teams that create only
          a set of functional requirements and leave testing until later in
          the project have only one representation. You’ll get the best
          results with a judicious combination of written requirements, tests,
          analysis models, and prototypes.</p></div><div class="book" title="Use cases and functional requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-182">Use cases and functional requirements</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Software developers don’t implement business requirements or
          user requirements. They implement functional requirements, specific
          bits of system behavior. Some practitioners regard the use cases as
          being the functional requirements. However, we have seen many
          organizations get into trouble when they simply pass their use cases
          to developers for implementation. Use cases describe the user’s
          perspective, looking at the externally visible behavior of the
          system. They don’t contain all the information that a developer
          needs to write the software. The user of an ATM doesn’t know about
          any back-end processing involved, such as communicating with the
          bank’s computer. This detail is invisible to the user, yet the
          developer needs to know about it. Developers who receive even fully
          dressed use cases often have many questions. To reduce this
          uncertainty, consider having a BA explicitly specify the functional
          requirements necessary to implement each use case (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-185">[ref008]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1004" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1288" class="calibre"></a>Many functional requirements fall right out of the
          dialog steps between the actor and the system. Some are obvious,
          such as “The system shall assign a unique sequence number to each
          request.” There is no point in duplicating those elsewhere if
          they’re clear from the use case. Other functional requirements don’t
          appear in the use case description. For instance, the way use cases
          are typically documented does not specify what the system should do
          if a precondition is <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">not</em></span> satisfied. This is an
          example of how use cases often do not provide all the necessary
          information for a developer to know what to build. The BA must
          derive those missing requirements and communicate them to developers
          and testers (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>). This analysis to get from
          the user’s view of the requirements to the developer’s view is one
          of the many ways the BA adds value to a project.</p><p class="calibre3">The Chemical Tracking System employed the use cases primarily
          as a tool to reveal the necessary functional requirements. The
          analysts wrote only casual descriptions of the less complex use
          cases. They then derived all the functional requirements that, when
          implemented, would allow an actor to perform the use case, including
          alternative flows and exception handlers. The analysts documented
          these functional requirements in the SRS, which was organized by
          product feature.</p><p class="calibre3">You can document the functionality associated with a use case
          in several ways. None of the following methods is perfect, so select
          the approach that best fits with how you want to document and manage
          your project’s software requirements.</p><div class="book" title="Use cases only"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2854">Use cases only</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">One possibility is to include the functional requirements
            along with each use case specification, if they aren’t already
            evident. You’ll still need to document nonfunctional requirements
            and any functionality that’s not associated with a use case.
            Additionally, several use cases might need the same functional
            requirement. If five use cases require that the user’s identity be
            authenticated, you don’t want to write five different blocks of
            code for that purpose. Rather than duplicate them, cross-reference
            functional requirements that appear in multiple use cases. The use
            cases could be collected in a user requirements document.</p></div><div class="book" title="Use cases and functional requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2855">Use cases and functional requirements</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Another option is to write fairly simple use cases and
            document the functional requirements derived from each one in an
            SRS or a requirements repository. In this approach, you should
            establish traceability between the use cases and their associated
            functional requirements. That way, if a use case changes, you can
            quickly find the affected functional requirements. The best way to
            manage the traceability is with a requirements management
            tool.</p></div><div class="book" title="Functional requirements only"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2856">Functional requirements only</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2298" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2405" class="calibre"></a>One more option is to organize your functional
            requirements by use case or by feature, and include both the use
            cases and the functional requirements in the SRS or requirements
            repository. This is the approach that the CTS team used, and we’ve
            done the same on several website development projects. We wrote
            most of our use cases in very concise form, not completing the
            full template from <a class="xref" title="Figure 8-3. Partial specification of the Chemical Tracking System’s “Request a Chemical” use case." href="#calibre_link-173">Figure&nbsp;8-3</a>. The details
            were then specified through a set of functional requirements. This
            approach doesn’t result in a separate user requirements
            document.</p></div><div class="book" title="Use cases and tests"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2857">Use cases and tests</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">If you write both detailed use case specifications and
            functional requirements, you might notice some duplication,
            particularly around the normal flow. There is little value in
            writing the same requirement twice. So another strategy is to
            write fairly complete use case specifications, but then write
            acceptance tests to determine if the system properly handles the
            basic behavior of the use case, alternative success paths, and the
            various things that could go wrong.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Use case traps to avoid"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2858">Use case traps to avoid</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">As with any software engineering technique, there are many

                be writing them at the appropriate level of abstraction. Don’t
                create a separate use case for every possible scenario. You’ll
                typically have many more use cases than business requirements
                and features, but many more functional requirements than use
                cases.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Highly complex use cases" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Highly complex use

                dialog steps, with a lot of embedded logic and branching
                conditions. It was incomprehensible. I’ve heard of even longer
                use cases, going on page after page. You can’t control the
                complexity of the business tasks, but you can control how you
                represent them in use cases. Select one success path through
                the use case and call that the normal flow. Use alternative
                flows for the other logic branches that lead to success, and
                use exceptions to handle branches that lead to failure. You
                might have many alternatives, but each one will be short and
                easy to understand. If a flow exceeds 10 to 15 steps in
                length, confirm whether it truly describes just a single
                scenario. Don’t arbitrarily split a legitimately long flow
                just because it has a lot of steps, though.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Including design in the use cases" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Including design in the use

                include definitions of the pertinent data elements right in
                the use case specification. This makes it difficult for people
                to find the information because it isn’t obvious which use

                processes or goals, there’s a problem. Write use cases from
                the user’s perspective, not the system’s point of view, and
                ask users to review them. Keep the use cases as simple as you
                can while still achieving the goal of clear and effective
                communication.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="book" title="Benefits of usage-centric requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2859">Benefits of usage-centric requirements</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The power of both use cases and user stories comes from their
        user-centric and usage-centric perspective. The users will have
        clearer expectations of what the new system will let them do than if
        you take a feature-centric approach. The customer representatives on
        several Internet development projects found that use cases clarified
        their notions of what visitors to their websites should be able to do.
        Use cases help BAs and developers understand the user’s business.
        Thinking through the actor-system dialogs reveals ambiguity and
        vagueness early in the development process, as does generating tests
        from the use cases.</p><p class="calibre3">Overspecifying the requirements up front and trying to include
        every conceivable function can lead to implementing unnecessary
        requirements. The usage-centric approach leads to functionality that
        will allow the user to perform certain known tasks. This helps prevent
        “orphan functionality” that seems like a good idea but that no one
        uses because it doesn’t relate directly to user goals.</p><p class="calibre3">Developing user requirements helps with requirements
        prioritization. The highest-priority functional requirements are those
        that originate in the top-priority user requirements. A use case or
        user story could be of high priority for several reasons:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">It describes part of a core business process that the system

          implemented for months or years. They’re likely to change or
          disappear before construction begins.</p></div><p class="calibre3">There are technical benefits to use cases, too. They reveal some
        of the important domain objects and their responsibilities to each
        other. Developers using object-oriented design methods can turn use
        cases into object models such as class and sequence diagrams. As
        business processes change over time, the tasks that are embodied in
        specific user requirements will change. If you’ve traced functional
        requirements, designs, code, and tests back to their parent user
        requirements&mdash;the voice of the user&mdash;it will be easier to cascade those
        changes through the entire system.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2861" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Next steps</div><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Write several use cases for your current project by using

      more?”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“You’re probably aware that Contoso requires an annual
      refresher class in the safe handling of hazardous chemicals,” Tim
      pointed out. “This is a corporate policy based on OSHA regulations. The
      Chemical Tracking System just enforces it. I know the stockroom guys
      used to give you whatever you wanted, but they can’t do that anymore.
      Sorry about the inconvenience, but you’ll have to take the refresher
      training before the system will let you request more
      phosgene.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">Every organization operates according to an extensive set of
      policies, laws, and industry standards. Industries such as banking,
      aviation, and medical device manufacture must comply with volumes of
      government regulations. Such controlling principles are known
      collectively as <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">business rules</em></span> or
      <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">business logic.</em></span> Business rules often are enforced
      through manual implementation of policies and procedures. In many cases,
      though, software applications also need to enforce these rules.</p><p class="calibre3">Most business rules originate outside the context of any specific
      software application. The corporate policy requiring annual training in
      handling hazardous chemicals applies even if all chemical purchasing and
      dispensing is done manually. Standard accounting practices were in use
      long before the digital computer was invented. Because business rules
      are a property of the business, they are not in themselves software
      requirements. However, business rules are a rich source of requirements
      because they dictate properties the system must possess to conform to
      the rules. As <a class="xref" title="Figure 1-1. Relationships among several types of requirements information.

      business <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">processes</em></span> or business
      <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">requirements</em></span>. As you saw in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 5. Establishing the business requirements" href="#calibre_link-32">Chapter&nbsp;5</a> a business
      <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">requirement</em></span> states a desirable outcome or a
      high-level objective of the organization that builds or procures a
      software solution. Business requirements serve as the justification for
      undertaking a project. A business <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">process</em></span> describes
      a series of activities that transform inputs into outputs to achieve a
      specific result. Information systems frequently automate business
      processes, which could lead to efficiencies and other benefits that
      achieve stated business requirements. Business
      <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">rules</em></span> influence business processes by establishing
      vocabulary, imposing restrictions, triggering actions, and governing how
      computations are carried out. The same business rule could apply to
      multiple manual or automated processes, which is one reason why it’s
      best to treat business rules as a separate set of information.</p><p class="calibre3">Not all companies treat their essential business rules as the
      valuable enterprise asset they are. Certain departments might document
      their local rules, but many companies lack a unified effort to document
      business rules in a common repository accessible to the IT organization.
      Treating this vital information as corporate folklore leads to numerous
      problems. If business rules are not properly documented and managed,
      they exist only in the heads of select individuals. A BA needs to know
      who to call to learn about rules that affect his project. Individuals
      can have conflicting understandings of the rules, which can lead to
      different software applications enforcing the same business rule
      inconsistently or overlooking it entirely. Having a master repository of
      business rules makes it easier for all projects that are affected by
      certain rules to learn about them and implement them in a consistent
      fashion.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-2863" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Having undocumented business rules known only to certain experts
        results in a knowledge vacuum when those experts leave the
        organization.</p></div><p class="calibre3">As an example, your organization likely has security policies that
      control access to information systems. Such policies might state the
      minimum and maximum length and the allowed characters in passwords,
      dictate the frequency of required password changes, state how many
      failed login attempts a user gets before his account is locked, and the
      like. Applications that the organization develops should apply these
      policies&mdash;these business rules&mdash;consistently. Tracing each rule into the
      code that implements it makes it easier to update systems to comply with
      changes in the rules, such as altering the required frequency of
      password changes. It also facilitates code reuse across projects.</p><div class="book" title="A business rules taxonomy"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2864">A business rules taxonomy</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-758" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-771" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-824" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2248" class="calibre"></a>The Business Rules Group (2012) provides definitions for

        information systems:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">From the business perspective: “A business rule is guidance
            that there is an obligation concerning conduct, action, practice,
            or procedure within a particular activity or sphere.” (There ought
            to be an explicit motivation for the rule, as well as enforcement
            methods and an understanding of what the consequences would be if
            the rule were broken.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">From the information system perspective: “A business rule is
            a statement that defines or constrains some aspect of the
            business. It is intended to assert business structure or to
            control or influence the behavior of the business.”</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Whole methodologies have been developed based on the discovery
        and documentation of business rules and their implementation in
        automated business rules systems (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-189">[ref235]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-190">[ref203]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-191">[ref205]</a>). Unless you’re
        building a system that is heavily rules-driven, you don’t need an
        elaborate methodology. Simply identify and document the rules that
        pertain to your system and link them to the specific requirements that
        implement them.</p><p class="calibre3">Numerous classification schemes have been proposed for
        organizing business rules (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-192">[ref204]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-193">[ref173]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-189">[ref235]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-194">[ref236]</a>). The simple taxonomy shown in <a class="xref" title="Figure 9-1. A simple business rule taxonomy." href="#calibre_link-195">Figure&nbsp;9-1</a>, with five types of

        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">terms</em></span>, defined words, phrases, and abbreviations
        that are important to the business. You could group terms with factual
        business rules. A glossary is another convenient place to define
        terms.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-195" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2865" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000041.jpeg" alt="An illustration showing a box labeled business rules               that has a horizontal row of five boxes below it.

        important than having heated arguments about precisely how to classify
        each one. However, a taxonomy is helpful to identify business rules
        you might not have thought of otherwise. Classifying the rules also
        gives you an idea of how you might apply them in a software
        application. For instance, constraints often lead to system
        functionality that enforces the restrictions, and action enablers lead
        to functionality to make something happen under certain conditions.
        Let’s see some examples of these five kinds of business rules.</p><div class="book" title="Facts"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2866">Facts</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-754" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-763" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-876" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1217" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2867" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Facts</em></span> are simply statements that
          are true about the business at a specified point in time. A fact
          describes associations or relationships between important business
          terms. Facts about data entities that are important to the system
          might appear in data models. (See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 13. Specifying data requirements" href="#calibre_link-87">Chapter&nbsp;13</a> for more about data
          modeling.) Examples of facts include the following:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Every chemical container has a unique bar code

          businesses. Collecting irrelevant facts can bog down business
          analysis. Even if they’re true, it might not be obvious how the
          development team is to use the information. Focus on facts that are
          in scope for the project, rather than trying to amass a complete
          collection of business knowledge. Try to connect each fact to the
          context diagram’s inputs and outputs, to system events, to known

            plan. Product design and implementation constraints represent
            imposed conditions that one might otherwise expect to be left to
            the discretion of the people building the solution. Such
            restrictions on the developer’s choices belong in the SRS or
            design specification. Certain business rules impose constraints on
            the way the business operates; these should be stored in a
            business rules repository. Whenever these constraints are
            reflected in the software requirements, indicate the pertinent
            rule as the rationale for each such derived requirement.</p></div><p class="calibre3">Constraining business rules can convey implications for
          software development even if they don’t translate directly into
          functionality. Consider a retail store’s policy that only
          supervisors and managers are allowed to issue cash refunds larger
          than $50. If you’re developing a point-of-sale application for use
          by store employees, this rule implies that each user must have a
          privilege level. The software must check to see if the current user
          is of sufficiently high privilege level to perform certain actions,
          such as opening the cash register drawer so a cashier can issue a
          refund to a customer.</p><p class="calibre3">Because many constraint-type business rules deal with which
          types of users can perform which functions, a concise way to
          document such rules is with a roles and permissions matrix (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-42">[ref013]</a>). <a class="xref" title="Figure 9-2. Constraining business rules sometimes can be represented in a roles and permissions matrix." href="#calibre_link-196">Figure&nbsp;9-2</a> illustrates
          such a matrix for various users of a public library’s information
          system. The roles have been separated into employees and
          non-employees. The system functions are grouped into system
          operations, operations dealing with patron records, and operations
          involving individual library items. An X in a cell indicates that
          the role named in the column has permission to perform the operation
          shown in the row.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-196" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2870" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000042.jpeg" alt="A matrix showing which roles have permissions to                 perform which actions." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;9-2.&nbsp;Constraining business rules sometimes can be represented in

          true is an <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">action enabler</em></span>. A person could
          perform the activity in a manual process. Alternatively, the rule
          might lead to specifying software functionality that makes an
          application exhibit the correct behavior when the system detects the
          triggering event. The conditions that lead to the action could be a
          complex combination of true and false values for multiple individual
          conditions. A decision table (described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 12. A picture is worth 1024 words" href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter&nbsp;12</a>) provides a concise way
          to document action-enabling business rules that involve extensive
          logic. A statement in the form “If &lt;some condition is true or
          some event takes place&gt;, then &lt;something happens&gt;” is a
          clue that someone might be describing an action enabler. Following
          are some examples of action-enabling business rules for the Chemical
          Tracking System:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">If the chemical stockroom has containers of a requested
              chemical in stock, then offer existing containers to the

          their commercial success. Consider how an online bookstore might use
          the following business rules to try to stimulate impulse purchases
          after a customer has asked to buy a specific product:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">If the customer ordered a book by an author who has

            on Blue Yonder Airlines to buy a ticket for my wife, Chris. When I
            attempted to finalize the purchase, BlueYonder.com said that it
            had encountered an error and couldn’t issue the ticket. It told me
            to call the airline immediately. The reservation agent I
            (finally!) spoke with told me that the airline couldn’t issue a
            mileage award ticket through the mail or by email because Chris
            and I have different last names. I had to go to the airport ticket
            counter and show identification to have the ticket issued.</p><p class="calibre3">This incident resulted from a constraining business rule
            that probably went something like this: “If the passenger has a
            different last name from the mileage redeemer, then the redeemer
            must pick up the ticket in person.” This is probably for fraud
            prevention. The software driving the Blue Yonder website enforces
            the rule, but in a way that resulted in usability shortcomings and
            customer inconvenience. Rather than simply telling me about the
            issue with different last names and what I needed to do, the
            system displayed an alarming error message. It wasted my time and
            the reservation agent’s time with an unnecessary phone call.
            Poorly thought-out business rule implementations can adversely
            affect your customer and hence your business.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Inferences"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2873">Inferences</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Sometimes called <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">inferred knowledge</em></span> or a

          question. “How long can I check out a DVD for?” you ask. The
          librarian replies, “You can check out a DVD or Blu-ray Disc for one
          week, and you may renew it up to two times for three days each, but
          only if another patron hasn’t placed a hold on it.” The librarian’s
          answer is based on the library’s business rules. However, her answer
          combines several rules into a single statement. Composite business
          rules like this can be hard to understand and maintain. It’s also
          hard to confirm that all possible conditions are covered. If several
          functionality segments trace back to this complex rule, it can be
          time-consuming to find and modify the appropriate code when just one
          part of the rule changes in the future.</p><p class="calibre3">A better strategy is to write your business rules at the
          atomic level, rather than combining multiple details into a single
          rule. This keeps your rules short and simple. It also facilitates
          reusing the rules, modifying them, and combining them in various
          ways. To write inferred knowledge and action-enabling business rules
          in an atomic way, don’t use “or” logic on the left-hand side of an
          “if/then” construct, and avoid “and” logic on the right-hand side
          (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-189">[ref235]</a>). You might break that complex library
          rule down into several atomic business rules, as shown in <a class="xref" title="Table 9-3. Some atomic business rules for a library" href="#calibre_link-198">Table&nbsp;9-3</a>.

          business rules are called <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">atomic</em></span> because they

        organizations should manage their rules as enterprise-level assets. A
        simple business rules catalog will suffice initially. If you’re using
        a requirements management tool, you can store business rules as a
        requirement type, provided they are accessible to all of your software
        projects. Large organizations or those whose operations and
        information systems are heavily business-rule driven should establish
        a database of business rules. Commercial rule-management tools become
        valuable if your rules catalog outgrows a solution using a word
        processor, spreadsheet, Wiki, or other collaboration tool. Some
        business-rule management systems contain rules engines, which can
        automate the implementation of the rules in your applications. The
        Business Rules Group (2012) maintains a list of products for managing
        business rules. As you identify new rules while working on an
        application, add them to the catalog rather than embedding them in the
        documentation for that specific application or&mdash;worse&mdash;only in its code.
        Rules related to safety, security, finance, or regulatory compliance
        pose the greatest risk if they are not managed and enforced
        appropriately.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-2878" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Don’t make your business rules catalog more complex than
          necessary. Use the simplest form of documenting business rules that
          ensures that your development teams will use them effectively. The
          business should own the rules repository, not the IT department or
          the project team.</p></div><p class="calibre3">As you gain experience with identifying and documenting business
        rules, you can apply structured templates for defining rules of
        different types (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-190">[ref203]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-189">[ref235]</a>). These templates describe patterns of keywords
        and clauses that structure the rules in a consistent fashion. They
        also facilitate storing the rules in a database, a commercial
        business-rule management tool, or a business rules engine. Sets of
        related rules can also be represented by using tools such as decision
        trees and decision tables (particularly when complex logic is

        This way you don’t have to worry about the use case specification
        becoming obsolete if the rule changes.</p><p class="calibre3">The “Type of rule” column identifies each business rule as being
        a fact, constraint, action enabler, inference, or computation. The
        “Static or dynamic” column indicates how likely the rule is to change
        over time. This information is helpful to developers. If they know
        that certain rules are subject to periodic change, they can structure
        the software to make the affected functionality or data easy to
        update. Income tax calculations change at least every year. If the
        developer structures the income tax information into tables or a
        database, rather than hard-coding it into the software, it’s a lot
        easier to update those values when necessary. It’s safe to hard-code
        laws of nature, such as calculations based on the laws of
        thermodynamics; laws of humans are much more volatile.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2879" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">The laws of separation</div><p class="calibre3">Air traffic control (ATC) systems must ensure minimum
          separation between aircraft in four dimensions&mdash;altitude, lateral,
          longitudinal, and time&mdash;to avoid collisions. The on-board aircraft
          systems, pilots, controllers on the ground, and the ATC system
          itself need to assemble flight path and speed information from
          hundreds of sources to anticipate when one plane might get
          dangerously close to another. Many business rules govern the minimum
          legal separation distances and times. These rules are dynamic: they
          change periodically as technology improves (GPS positioning versus
          radar, for example) and regulations are updated. This implies that
          the system needs to be able to accept a new set of rules on a
          regular schedule, validate the rules’ self-consistency and
          completeness, and switch over to using the new rules at the same
          time the pilots and controllers do. One ATC project initially
          hard-coded the current set of such business rules into their
          software, thinking of them as being static. Major rework was
          required when the stakeholders realized the need to cope with
          periodic changes in these safety-critical rules.</p></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-760" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1019" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1081" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2880" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1453" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1511" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2548" class="calibre"></a>The final column in <a class="xref" title="Table 9-4. Some sample business rules catalog entries" href="#calibre_link-199">Table&nbsp;9-4</a> identifies the

        when eliciting user requirements, asking users “What are your business
        rules?” doesn’t get you very far. Sometimes you invent business rules
        as you go along, sometimes they come up during requirements
        discussions, and sometimes you need to hunt for them. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-189">[ref235]</a> describes a comprehensive process for discovering
        business rules. Following are several common places and ways to look
        for rules (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-200">[ref027]</a>):</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">“Common knowledge” from the organization, often collected

            also be represented as a roles and permissions matrix like the one

        sources doesn’t mean they necessarily apply to your current project or
        that they are even still valid. Computational formulas implemented in
        the code of legacy applications could be obsolete. Be sure to confirm
        whether rules gleaned from older documents and applications need to be
        updated. Assess the scope of applicability of rules you discover. Are
        they local to the project, or do they span a business domain or the
        entire enterprise?</p><p class="calibre3">Often, project stakeholders already know about business rules
        that will influence the application. Certain employees sometimes deal
        with particular types or classes of rules. If that’s the case in your
        environment, find out who those people are and bring them into the
        discussion. The BA can glean business rules during elicitation
        activities that also define other requirements artifacts and models.
        During interviews and workshops, the BA can ask questions to probe
        around the rationale for the requirements and constraints that users
        present. These discussions frequently surface business rules as the
        underlying rationale. <a class="xref" title="Figure 9-3. Discovering business rules by asking questions from different perspectives." href="#calibre_link-201">Figure&nbsp;9-3</a> shows several
        potential origins of rules. It also suggests some questions a BA can

        determine which ones must be implemented in the software. Business
        rules and their corresponding functional requirements sometimes look a
        lot alike. However, the rules are external statements of policy that
        must be enforced in software, thereby driving system functionality.
        Every BA must decide which rules pertain to his application, which
        ones must be enforced in the software, and how to enforce them.</p><p class="calibre3">Recall the constraint rule from the Chemical Tracking System
        requiring that training records be current before a user can request a
        hazardous chemical. The analyst would derive different functional
        requirements to comply with this rule depending on whether the
        training records database is accessible to the Chemical Tracking
        System. If it is, the system can look up the user’s training record
        and decide whether to accept or reject the request. If the records
        aren’t available online, though, the system might store the chemical
        request temporarily and send a message to the training coordinator,
        who could approve or reject the request. The rule is the same in
        either situation, but the software functionality&mdash;the actions to take
        when the business rule is encountered during execution&mdash;varies
        depending on the system’s environment.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1354" class="calibre"></a>As another illustration, consider the following
        rules:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Rule #1 (action enabler): “If the expiration date for a
            chemical container has been reached, then notify the person who
            currently possesses that container.”</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Rule #2 (fact): “A container of a chemical that can form
            explosive decomposition products expires one year after its
            manufacture date.”</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Rule #1 serves as the origin for a system feature called “Notify
        chemical owner of expiration.” Additional rules like #2 would help the
        system determine which containers will have expiration dates and thus
        require notifying their owners at the right time. For instance, an
        opened can of ether becomes unsafe because it can form explosive
        byproducts in the presence of oxygen. Based on such rules, it’s clear
        that the Chemical Tracking System must monitor the status of chemical
        containers that have expiration dates and inform the right people to
        return the containers for safe disposal. The BA might derive some
        functional requirements for that feature such as the following:</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Expired.Notify.Before</strong></span>
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">If the status of a chemical container that has an expiration

        owner one week before the date the container
        expires.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Expired.Notify.Date</strong></span>
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">If the status of a chemical container that has an expiration
        date is not Disposed, the system shall notify the container’s current
        owner on the date the container expires.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Expired.Notify.After</strong></span>
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">If the status of a chemical container that has an expiration
        date is not Disposed, the system shall notify the container’s current
        owner one week after the date the container expires.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Expired.Notify.Manager</strong></span>
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">If the status of a chemical container that has an expiration
        date is not Disposed, the system shall notify the manager of the
        container’s current owner two weeks after the date the container
        expires.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">Whenever you encounter a set of very similar requirements like
        these, consider laying them out in the form of a table instead of a
        list (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>). This is more compact and easier to
        review, understand, and modify. It also provides a more concise way to
        label the requirements, because the table has to show just the
        suffixes to append to the parent requirement’s label. Here’s an
        alternative representation for the preceding four functional
        requirements:</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Expired.Notify</strong></span> If the status

        following are three possibilities.</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">If you are using a requirements management tool, create a

            stored in the same repository as the requirements. (See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 29. Links in the requirements chain" href="#calibre_link-13">Chapter&nbsp;29</a>.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">If the business rules and requirements are stored in word

            prone to breaking if the location of the rules collection
            changes.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">These links keep the requirements current with rule changes
        because the requirements simply point to the master instance of the
        rule. If the rule changes, you can search for the linked rule ID to
        find requirements&mdash;or implemented functionality&mdash;you might need to
        change. Using links like this facilitates reusing the same rule in
        multiple places and projects, because the rules are not buried in the
        documentation for any single application. However, a developer reading
        the SRS will need to follow the cross-referenced link to access the
        rule details. This is the trade-off that results when you elect not to
        duplicate information (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3">As with so many aspects of requirements engineering, there is no

      commercial software company’s next-generation flagship product, a senior
      manager convened about 60 employees in a daylong off-site
      “voice-of-the-customer workshop.” These employees worked with
      facilitators to generate ideas for the new product. The manager compiled
      the results of these brainstorming sessions into a 100-page document. He
      called this a requirements specification, but in fact it was nothing
      more than a pile of information.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">The information from the brain dump by all these smart
      people wasn’t classified into various categories, organized logically,
      analyzed, or otherwise processed into anything that described a proposed
      software solution. Developers could not have gleaned what they needed to
      know about the new product from this massive collection of ideas.
      Certainly there were nuggets of valuable requirements buried among all
      the chaff. But simply collecting raw ideas and needs into a long list
      isn’t an effective way to document and communicate software
      requirements.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">Clear and effective communication is the core principle of
      requirements development&mdash;communication from people with needs to people
      who can conceive solutions, then to people who can implement and verify
      those solutions. A skilled business analyst will choose the most
      effective way to communicate each type of requirements information to
      each audience.</p><p class="calibre3">The result of requirements development is a documented agreement
      among stakeholders about the product to be built. As you saw in earlier
      chapters, the vision and scope document contains the business
      requirements, and user requirements can be captured in the form of use
      cases or user stories. The product’s functional and nonfunctional
      requirements often are stored in a software requirements specification,
      or SRS, which is delivered to those who must design, build, and verify
      the solution. Recording requirements in an organized fashion that key
      project stakeholders can review helps ensure that they know what they’re
      agreeing to.</p><p class="calibre3">This chapter addresses the purpose, structure, and contents of the
      SRS. We will describe the SRS as being a document, but it doesn’t have
      to be in the form of a traditional word-processing document. In fact,
      documents pose numerous limitations:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">It’s difficult to store descriptive attributes along with the
          requirements.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Change management is clumsy.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">It’s difficult to retain historical versions of the
          requirements.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">It’s not easy to subset out a portion of requirements that are
          allocated to a particular iteration or keep track of those that were
          once approved but then deferred or canceled.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">It’s hard to trace requirements to other development
          artifacts.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Duplicating a requirement that logically fits in multiple

      (which has many of the same limitations as a document), a Wiki, a
      database, or a requirements management (RM) tool (see <a class="xref" title="Chapter 30. Tools for requirements engineering" href="#calibre_link-90">Chapter&nbsp;30</a>). Think of these as
      different possible repositories or containers for requirements
      information. No matter what form of requirements repository you use, you
      still need the same kinds of information. The SRS template described
      here is a helpful reminder of information to collect and how you might
      organize it.</p><p class="calibre3">Not everyone agrees that it’s worth the time to document
      requirements. And on exploratory or highly volatile projects where
      you’re not sure what solution you’ll end up with, trying to keep up with
      changes in the requirements details adds little value. However, the cost
      of recording knowledge is small compared to the cost of acquiring that
      knowledge or regenerating it at some point in the future. The acts of
      specification and modeling help project participants think through and
      precisely state important things that a verbal discussion can leave
      ambiguous. If you are <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">100 percent certain</em></span> that no
      stakeholders will ever need a specific piece of information beyond the
      duration of their own short-term memories, then you don’t need to record
      it. Otherwise, store it in some kind of a group memory.</p><p class="calibre3">You will never get perfect requirements. Remember that you are
      writing requirements for certain audiences. The amount of detail, the
      kinds of information you provide, and the way you organize it should all
      be intended to meet the needs of your audiences. Analysts quite
      naturally write requirements from their own point of view, but really
      they should write them to be most meaningful to those who have to
      understand the requirements and do work based on them. This is why it’s
      important to have representatives of those audiences review the
      requirements to make sure they’ll meet their needs.</p><p class="calibre3">Progressive refinement of detail is a key principle for effective
      requirements development. On most projects it’s neither realistic nor
      necessary to pin down every requirement detail early in the project.
      Instead, think in terms of layers. You need to learn just enough about
      the requirements to be able to roughly prioritize them and allocate them
      to forthcoming releases or iterations. Then you can detail groups of
      requirements in a just-in-time fashion to give developers enough
      information so they can avoid excessive and unnecessary rework.</p><p class="calibre3">Don’t expect even the finest requirements documentation to replace
      ongoing discussions throughout the project. Keep the communication lines
      open among the BA, development team, customer representatives, and other
      stakeholders so that they can quickly address the myriad issues that
      will arise.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-2887" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Do not rely on telepathy and clairvoyance as substitutes for

      but few software developers&mdash;and even fewer customers&mdash;are familiar with
      them. Most projects don’t demand this level of formality, but I’d
      certainly hope that the designers of high-risk systems like nuclear
      power plant control systems use formal specification methods. Structured
      natural language, augmented with visual models and other representation
      techniques (such as tables, mock-ups, photographs, and mathematical
      expressions), remains the most practical way for most software projects
      to document their requirements. The rest of this chapter addresses how
      you might organize the information in a software requirements
      specification. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 11. Writing excellent requirements" href="#calibre_link-59">Chapter&nbsp;11</a>

      suggestions for how to write them.</p><div class="book" title="The software requirements specification"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2889">The software requirements specification</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The software requirements specification goes by many names in
        various organizations, although organizations do not use these terms
        in the same way. It is sometimes called a <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">business
        requirements document</em></span> (BRD)<span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">, functional
        specification, product specification, system specification</em></span>,
        or simply <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">requirements document</em></span>. Because
        “software requirements specification” is an industry-standard term,
        that’s what we’ll call it here (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-37">[ref124]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3">The SRS states the functions and capabilities that a software
        system must provide, its characteristics, and the constraints that it
        must respect. It should describe as completely as necessary the
        system’s behaviors under various conditions, as well as desired system
        qualities such as performance, security, and usability. The SRS is the
        basis for subsequent project planning, design, and coding, as well as
        the foundation for system testing and user documentation. However, it
        should not contain design, construction, testing, or project
        management details other than known design and implementation
        constraints. Even people working on agile projects need the kind of
        information found in a good SRS. They don’t ordinarily collect all
        this information in a cohesive deliverable, but an SRS template
        provides a convenient reminder of what kinds of knowledge to explore.
        This chapter concludes with a section that describes how agile
        projects typically handle requirements specification.</p><div class="note" title="Important"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-2890" class="calibre"></a>Important</h3><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2144" class="calibre"></a>A single requirements deliverable often cannot meet
          the needs of all audiences. Some people need to know just the
          business objectives, others want only a high-level big picture,
          still others want to see just the user’s perspective, and yet others
          need all the details. This is one reason why we advocate creating
          the deliverables we call the vision and scope document, user
          requirements document, and software requirements specification.
          Don’t expect all of your user representatives to read the detailed
          SRS, and don’t expect developers to learn all they need from a set
          of use cases or user stories.</p></div><p class="calibre3">Numerous audiences rely on the SRS:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Customers, the marketing department, and sales staff need to

        the requirements agreement, no one should expect it to appear in the
        product.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2891" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">How many specifications?</div><p class="calibre3">Most projects will create just one software requirements
          specification. This isn’t practical for large projects, though.
          Large systems projects often write a system requirements
          specification, followed by separate software and perhaps hardware
          requirements specifications (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-37">[ref124]</a>). One company
          was building a very complex process control application, with more
          than 100 people working for multiple years. This project had about
          800 high-level requirements in its system requirements
          specification. The project was divided into 20 subprojects, each of
          which had its own software requirements specification with perhaps
          800 or 900 requirements derived from the system requirements. This
          makes for a lot of documentation, but a large project becomes
          unmanageable if you don’t take a divide-and-conquer approach.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-646" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-859" class="calibre"></a>At the other extreme, another company created just a
          single guiding document for each medium-sized project, which they
          called simply “The Spec.” The Spec contained every piece of known
          information about the project: requirements, estimates, project
          plans, quality plans, test plans, tests, everything. Change
          management and version control on such an all-inclusive document is
          a nightmare. Nor is the information level in such an all-inclusive
          document suitable for each audience for requirements
          information.</p><p class="calibre3">A third company that began to adopt agile development
          practices stopped writing any formal documentation. Instead, they
          wrote user stories for a large project on sticky notes that they
          placed on their office walls. Unfortunately for one project, the
          adhesive on the sticky notes gradually failed. A couple of months
          into the project, it was normal for no-longer-sticky notes to
          flutter to the ground as someone walked by the wall.</p><p class="calibre3">Still another company took an intermediate approach. Although
          their projects weren’t huge and could be specified in just 40 to 60
          pages, some team members wanted to subdivide the SRS into as many as
          12 separate documents: one SRS for a batch process, one for the
          reporting engine, and one for each of 10 reports. A document
          explosion like this causes headaches because it’s hard to keep
          changes to them synchronized and to make sure the right people get
          all the information they need efficiently.</p><p class="calibre3">A better alternative for all of these situations is to store
          the requirements in a requirements management tool, as described in
          <a class="xref" title="Chapter 30. Tools for requirements engineering" href="#calibre_link-90">Chapter&nbsp;30</a>. An RM tool
          also helps greatly with the problem of whether to create a single
          SRS or multiple specifications for a project that plans multiple
          product releases or development iterations (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>). The SRS for any one portion of the product or
          for a given iteration then is just a report generated from the
          database contents based on certain query criteria.</p></div><p class="calibre3">You don’t have to write the SRS for the entire product before
        beginning development, but you should capture the requirements for
        each increment before building that increment. Incremental development
        is appropriate when you want to get some functionality into the users’
        hands quickly. Feedback from using the early increments will shape the
        rest of the project. However, every project should baseline an
        agreement for each set of requirements before the team implements
        them. <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Baselining</em></span> is the process of transitioning
        an SRS under development into one that has been reviewed and approved.
        Working from an agreed-upon set of requirements minimizes
        miscommunication and unnecessary rework. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 2. Requirements from the customer’s perspective" href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter&nbsp;2</a> and <a class="xref" title="Chapter 27. Requirements management practices" href="#calibre_link-89">Chapter&nbsp;27</a> for more about
        baselining.</p><p class="calibre3">It’s important to organize and write the SRS so that the diverse
        stakeholders can understand it. Keep the following readability
        suggestions in mind:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Use an appropriate template to organize all the necessary

          This allows you to refer to specific requirements in a change
          request, modification history, cross-reference, or requirements
          traceability matrix. It also enables reusing the requirements in
          multiple projects. Uniquely identified requirements facilitate
          collaboration between team members when they’re discussing
          requirements, as in a peer review meeting. Simple numbered or
          bulleted lists aren’t adequate for these purposes. Let’s look at the
          advantages and shortcomings of several requirements-labeling
          methods. Select whichever technique makes the most sense for your
          situation.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2893" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Number 8, with a bullet</div><p class="calibre3">I was chatting with my seatmate on a long airplane flight
            once. It turned out that Dave was also in the software business. I
            mentioned that I had some interest in requirements. Dave pulled an
            SRS out of his briefcase. I don’t know if he carried one with him
            everywhere he went for emergency purposes or what. I saw that the
            requirements in his document were organized hierarchically, but
            they were all in bulleted list form. He had up to eight levels of
            bullet hierarchy in some places. They all used different
            symbols&mdash;❍, ■, ♦, ✓, ❑, ➭, and the like&mdash;but they had no labels more
            meaningful than those simple symbols. It’s impossible to refer to
            a bulleted item or to trace it to a design element, code segment,
            or test.</p></div><div class="book" title="Sequence number"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2894">Sequence number</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1312" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1355" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2303" class="calibre"></a>The simplest approach gives every requirement a
            unique sequence number, such as UC-9 or FR-26. Commercial
            requirements management tools assign such an identifier when a
            user adds a new requirement to the tool’s database. The prefix
            indicates the requirement type, such as <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">FR</em></span>
            for <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">functional requirement</em></span>. A number is not
            reused if a requirement is deleted, so you don’t have to worry
            about a reader confusing the original FR-26 with a new FR-26. This
            simple numbering approach doesn’t provide any logical or
            hierarchical grouping of related requirements, the number doesn’t
            imply any kind of ordering, and the labels give no clue as to what
            each requirement is about. It does make it easy to retain a unique
            identifier if you move requirements around in a document.</p></div><div class="book" title="Hierarchical numbering"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2895">Hierarchical numbering</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">In the most commonly used convention, if the functional
            requirements appear in <a class="xref" title="3.2 Project Priorities" href="#calibre_link-203">3.2 Project Priorities</a> of your SRS,
            they will all have labels that begin with 3.2. More digits
            indicate a more detailed, lower-level requirement, so you know
            that 3.2.4.3 is a child requirement of 3.2.4. This method is
            simple, compact, and familiar. Your word processor can probably
            assign the numbers automatically. Requirements management tools
            generally also support hierarchical numbering.</p><p class="calibre3">However, hierarchical numbering poses some problems. The
            labels can grow to many digits in even a medium-sized SRS. Numeric
            labels tell you nothing about the intent of a requirement. If you
            are using a word processor, typically this scheme does not
            generate persistent labels. If you insert a new requirement, the
            numbers of the following requirements in that section all will be
            incremented. Delete or move a requirement, and the numbers
            following it in that section will be decremented. Delete, insert,
            merge, or move whole sections, and a lot of labels change. These
            changes disrupt any references to those requirements elsewhere in
            the system.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-2896" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">A BA once told me in all seriousness, “We don’t let people
              insert requirements&mdash;it messes up the numbering.” Don’t let
              ineffective practices hamper your ability to work effectively
              and sensibly.</p></div><p class="calibre3">An improvement over hierarchical numbering is to number the
            major sections of the requirements hierarchically and then
            identify individual functional requirements in each section with a
            short text code followed by a sequence number. For example, the
            SRS might contain “Section 3.5&mdash;Editor Functions,” and the
            requirements in that section could be labeled ED-1, ED-2, and so
            forth. This approach provides some hierarchy and organization
            while keeping the labels short, somewhat meaningful, and less
            positionally dependent. It doesn’t totally solve the sequence
            number problem, though.</p></div><div class="book" title="Hierarchical textual tags"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2897">Hierarchical textual tags</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Consultant <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-204">[ref083]</a> suggests a text-based
            hierarchical tagging scheme for labeling individual requirements.
            Consider this requirement: “The system shall ask the user to
            confirm any request to print more than 10 copies.” This
            requirement might be tagged Print.ConfirmCopies. This indicates
            that it is part of the print function and relates to the number of
            copies to print. Hierarchical textual tags are structured,
            meaningful, and unaffected by adding, deleting, or moving other
            requirements. The sample SRS in <a class="xref" title="Appendix D. Sample requirements documents" href="#calibre_link-116">Appendix&nbsp;D</a> illustrates this
            labeling technique, as do other examples throughout the book. This
            method also is suitable for labeling business rules if you’re
            maintaining them manually, rather than in a dedicated business
            rules repository or tool.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1375" class="calibre"></a>Using hierarchical textual tags like this helps
            solve another problem. With any hierarchical organization you have
            parent-child relationships between requirements. If the parent is
            written as a functional requirement, the relationship between the
            children and the parent can be confusing. A good convention is to
            write the parent requirement to look like a title, a heading, or a
            feature name, rather than looking like a functional requirement in
            itself. The children requirements of that parent, in the
            aggregate, deliver the capability described in the parent.
            Following is an example that contains a heading and four
            functional requirements.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="calibre_link-2898" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2899" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000044.gif" alt="image with no caption" class="calibre17" /></div></div><p class="calibre3">The full unique ID of each requirement is built by appending
            each line’s label to the parent labels above it. The <span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Product</strong></span> statement is written as a
            heading, not as a discrete requirement. The first functional
            requirement is tagged <span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Product.Cart</strong></span>. The full ID for the third
            requirement is <span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Product.Discount.Error</strong></span>. This hierarchical
            scheme avoids the maintenance problems with the hierarchical
            numbering, but the tags are longer and you do have to think of
            meaningful names for them, perhaps building from the name of the
            relevant feature. It can be challenging to maintain uniqueness,
            especially if you have multiple people working on the set of
            requirements. You can simplify the scheme by combining the
            hierarchical naming technique with a sequence number suffix for
            small sets of requirements: Product.Cart.01, Product.Cart.02, and

          a specific requirement. Use the notation <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">TBD</em></span>
          (to be determined) to flag these knowledge gaps. Plan to resolve all
          TBDs before implementing a set of requirements. Any uncertainties
          that remain increase the risk of a developer or a tester making
          errors and having to perform rework. When the developer encounters a
          TBD, he might make his best guess&mdash;which won’t always be
          correct&mdash;instead of tracking down the requirement’s originator to
          resolve it. If you must proceed with construction of the next
          product increment while TBDs remain, either defer implementing the
          unresolved requirements or design those portions of the product to
          be easily modifiable when the open issues are resolved. Record TBDs
          and other requirements questions in an issues list. As the number of
          open issues dwindles, the requirements are stabilizing. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 27. Requirements management practices" href="#calibre_link-89">Chapter&nbsp;27</a> further describes
          managing and resolving open issues.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-2901" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1407" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1813" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2127" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2160" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2434" class="calibre"></a>TBDs won’t resolve themselves.

          benefits and drawbacks. On the plus side, exploring possible user
          interfaces with paper prototypes, working mock-ups, wireframes, or
          simulation tools makes the requirements tangible to both users and
          developers. As discussed in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 15. Risk reduction through prototyping" href="#calibre_link-10">Chapter&nbsp;15</a> these are powerful
          techniques for eliciting and validating requirements. If the
          product’s users have expectations of how portions of the product
          might look and feel&mdash;and hence could be disappointed if their
          expectations weren’t fulfilled&mdash;those expectations belong in the
          realm of requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">On the negative side, screen images and user interface
          architectures describe solutions and might not truly be
          requirements. Including them in the SRS makes the document larger,
          and big requirements documents frighten some people. Delaying
          baselining of the SRS until the UI design is complete can slow down
          development and try the patience of people who are already concerned
          about spending too much time on requirements. Including UI design in
          the requirements can result in the visual design driving the
          requirements, which often leads to functional gaps. The people who
          write the requirements aren’t necessarily well qualified for
          designing user interfaces. Additionally, after stakeholders see a
          user interface in an SRS (or anywhere else), they will not “unsee”
          it. Early visualization can clarify requirements, but it can also
          lead to resistance to improving the UI over time.</p><p class="calibre3">Screen layouts don’t replace written user and functional
          requirements. Don’t expect developers to deduce the underlying
          functionality and data relationships from screen shots. One Internet
          development company repeatedly got in trouble because the team
          routinely went directly from signing a contract with a client into
          an eight-hour visual design workshop. They never sufficiently
          understood what a user would be able to do at each website they
          built, so they spent a lot of time fixing the sites after
          delivery.</p><p class="calibre3">If you really do want to implement certain functionality with
          specific UI controls and screen layouts, it’s both appropriate and
          important to include that information in the SRS as design
          constraints. Design constraints restrict the choices available to
          the user interface designer. Just make sure that you don’t impose
          constraints unnecessarily, prematurely, or for the wrong reasons. If
          the SRS is specifying an enhancement to an existing system, it often
          makes sense to include screen displays exactly as they are to be
          implemented. The developers are already constrained by the current
          reality of the existing system, so it’s possible to know up front
          just how the modified&mdash;and perhaps also the new&mdash;displays should
          look.</p><p class="calibre3">A sensible balance is to include conceptual images&mdash;I call them
          sketches, no matter how nicely drawn they are&mdash;of selected displays
          in the requirements without demanding that the implementation
          precisely follow those models. See <a class="xref" title="Figure 10-1. Example of a user interface “sketch” suitable for inclusion in a requirements document." href="#calibre_link-205">Figure&nbsp;10-1</a> for a sample
          webpage sketch. Incorporating such sketches in the SRS helpfully
          communicates another view of the requirements, but makes it clear
          that the sketches are not the committed screen designs. For example,
          a preliminary sketch of a complex dialog box will illustrate the
          intent behind a group of requirements, but a visual designer might
          turn it into a tabbed dialog box to improve usability.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-205" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2903" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000045.jpeg" alt="A hand-drawn sketch showing the rough layout for the                 home page of a website to promote a book." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;10-1.&nbsp;Example of a user interface “sketch” suitable for inclusion

          find it more manageable to document the user interface design
          specifics in a separate user interface specification or by using UI
          design tools or prototyping tools. Use techniques such as
          display-action-response models to describe screen element names,
          their properties, and their behavior in detail (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-42">[ref013]</a>).</p></div></div><div class="book" title="A software requirements specification template"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2904">A software requirements specification template</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Every software development organization should adopt one or more

        was made, and the reason for it (see <a class="xref" title="Chapter 27. Requirements management practices" href="#calibre_link-89">Chapter&nbsp;27</a>). The rest of this

            implemented the user interface in Java. The two subsystems
            communicated through an application programming interface (API).
            Unfortunately, the knowledge base team periodically modified the

        of approaches to specifying requirements that differ from the method
        just described. As you saw in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 8. Understanding user requirements" href="#calibre_link-35">Chapter&nbsp;8</a> many agile projects
        employ user stories during elicitation. Each user story is a statement
        of a user need or functionality that will be valuable to the user or
        purchaser of the system (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-34">[ref043]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-104">[ref045]</a>). Teams might begin specification on agile
        projects by writing just enough information for each user story so
        that the stakeholders have a general understanding of what the story
        is about and can prioritize it relative to other stories. This allows
        the team to begin planning allocations of specific stories to
        iterations. The team might aggregate a group of related stories into a
        “minimally marketable feature” that needs to be fully implemented
        prior to a product release so the feature delivers the expected
        customer value.</p><p class="calibre3">User stories are accumulated and prioritized into a dynamic
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">product backlog</em></span> that evolves throughout the
        project. Large stories that encompass significant functionality that
        cannot be implemented within a single iteration are subdivided into
        smaller stories, which are allocated to multiple iterations for
        implementation. (See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 20. Agile projects" href="#calibre_link-25">Chapter&nbsp;20</a>.) User stories
        can be recorded on something as simple as index cards, instead of in a
        traditional document. Some agile teams record their stories in a story
        management tool, whereas others don’t retain them at all following
        implementation.</p><p class="calibre3">As the team gets into each iteration, conversations among the
        product owner, people performing the business analyst role,
        developers, testers, and users will flesh out the details of each
        story allocated to the iteration. That is, specification involves the
        progressive refinement of detail at the right stage of the project,
        which is a good practice on any project. Those details generally
        correspond to what we have identified as functional requirements in
        the SRS. However, agile projects often represent those details in the
        form of user acceptance tests that describe how the system will behave
        if the story is properly implemented. The tests for a story are
        conducted during the iteration in which the story is implemented and
        in future iterations for regression testing. As with all tests, they
        should cover exception conditions as well as the expected behavior.
        These acceptance tests can be written on cards as well or recorded in
        a more persistent form, such as in a testing tool. Tests should be
        automated to assure rapid and complete regression testing. If the team
        elects to discard the original user stories, then the only persistent
        documentation of the requirements is likely to be the acceptance
        tests, if they are stored in a tool.</p><p class="calibre3">Similarly, nonfunctional requirements can be written on cards
        not as user stories but as constraints (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-34">[ref043]</a>).
        Alternatively, teams might specify nonfunctional requirements that are
        associated with a specific user story in the form of acceptance
        criteria or tests, such as to demonstrate achievement of specific
        quality attribute goals. As an example, security tests might
        demonstrate that certain users are permitted to access the
        functionality described in a particular user story but that the system
        blocks access for other users. The agile team is not precluded from
        using other methods to represent requirements knowledge, such as
        analysis models or a data dictionary. They should select whatever
        representation techniques are customary and appropriate for their
        culture and project.</p><p class="calibre3">It’s up to each project team to choose the most appropriate
        forms for specifying its software requirements. Remember the
        overarching goal of requirements development: to accumulate a shared
        understanding of requirements that is <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">good enough</em></span>
        to allow construction of the next portion of the product to proceed at
        an acceptable level of risk. The appropriate level of formality and
        detail in which to document requirements depends on factors including
        the following:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The extent to which just-in-time informal verbal and visual
            communication between customers and developers can supply the

            the team effectively synchronized across time and space</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The extent to which it is valuable or necessary to retain
            requirements knowledge for future enhancement, maintenance,
            application reengineering, verification, statutory and audit
            mandates, product certification, or contractual
            satisfaction</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The extent to which acceptance tests can serve as effective

        what development life cycle they are following, or what elicitation
        techniques the BA is using, effective requirements specification is an
        essential key to success. There are many ways to achieve this. Just
        remember that when you don’t specify high-quality requirements, the
        resulting software is like a box of chocolates: you never know what

      That’s not working the way I had in mind.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Gautam replied, “Let me find the requirements you sent
      for that. Here they are. The user story said, ‘As a Customer, I want to
      listen to previews of the available songs so I can decide which ones to
      buy.’ My notes say that when we discussed this, you said each song
      sample should be 30 seconds long and that it should use our built-in MP3
      player so the customer didn’t have to wait for another player to launch.
      Isn’t that working correctly?”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“Well, yes, that all works fine,” said Ruth, “but there
      are a couple of problems. I can click on the play icon to start the
      sample, but I don’t have any way to pause it or stop it. I’m forced to
      listen to the entire 30-second sample. Also, all the samples start at
      the beginning of the song. Some songs have long introductions so you
      really can’t hear what they’re like from just the beginning. The sample
      should start somewhere in the middle of those songs so people could hear
      what they’re really like. And the sample starts playing at full volume
      and then stops abruptly. If the customer’s speakers are up pretty loud
      this could be startling. I think it would be better if we fade in and
      fade out on each sample.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Gautam was a little frustrated. “I wish you had told me

      take a few more days.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">The best requirements repository in the world is useless if it

      desirable characteristics of requirements and of requirements documents.
      It presents numerous guidelines for writing requirements, along with
      many examples of flawed requirements and suggestions for improving them.
      These recommendations apply to the requirements that are created for any
      project following any development life cycle. The requirements authors
      on each project need to judge the appropriate level of precision and
      detail for their requirements, but there’s no substitute for clear

        whether your requirements possess these desired attributes is to have
        several stakeholders review them. Different stakeholders will spot
        different kinds of problems. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 17. Validating the requirements" href="#calibre_link-60">Chapter&nbsp;17</a> describes the use of

            lacking certain information, use <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">TBD</em></span> (to be

            supplied the initial requirement, a higher-level system
            requirement, a use case, a business rule, or another document. A
            low-level requirement that conflicts with its parent is not
            correct. To assess the correctness of user requirements, user

            can provide a reality check on what can and cannot be done
            technically and what can be done only at excessive cost or effort.
            Incremental development approaches and proof-of-concept prototypes
            are two ways to evaluate requirement feasibility. If a requirement
            needs to be cut because it is not be feasible, understand the

            should originate from a source that has the authority to provide
            requirements. Trace functional and nonfunctional requirements back
            to specific voice-of-the-user input, such as a use case or user
            story. You should be able to relate each requirement to a business
            objective that clearly indicates why it’s necessary. If someone

            respond to schedule overruns, personnel losses, or new
            requirements that come along. Requirements prioritization should
            be a collaborative activity involving multiple stakeholder

One

            interpret a given requirement. The other type of ambiguity is
            harder to catch. That’s when different people read the requirement
            and come up with different interpretations of it. The requirement
            makes sense to each of them but means something different to each
            of them. Inspections are a good way to spot ambiguities (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-54">[ref245]</a>). A formal peer review such as an inspection
            (as opposed to just passing out the requirements to individuals to
            examine on their own) provides an opportunity for each participant
            to compare his understanding of each requirement to someone
            else’s. “Comprehensible” is related to “unambiguous”: readers must
            understand what each requirement is saying. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 17. Validating the requirements" href="#calibre_link-60">Chapter&nbsp;17</a> describes the software

            There are always some assumed or implied requirements, although
            they carry more risk than explicitly stated requirements. Missing
            requirements are hard to spot because they aren’t there! The
            section “Avoiding incompleteness” later in this chapter suggests
            some ways to identify missing requirements. Any specification that

            requirements of the same type or with higher-level business, user,
            or system requirements. If you don’t resolve contradictions
            between requirements before diving into construction, the
            developers will have to deal with them. Recording the originator
            of each requirement lets you know who to talk to if you discover
            conflicts. It can be hard to spot inconsistencies when related
            information is stored in different locations, such as in a vision
            and scope document and in a requirements management tool.</p></div><div class="book" title="Modifiable"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-2950">Modifiable</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">You can always rewrite a requirement, but you should
            maintain a history of changes made to each requirement, especially
            after they are baselined. You also need to know about connections
            and dependencies between requirements so you can find all the ones
            that must be changed together. Modifiability dictates that each
            requirement be uniquely labeled and expressed separately from
            others so you can refer to it unambiguously. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 10. Documenting the requirements" href="#calibre_link-38">Chapter&nbsp;10</a> for various ways to
            label requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">To facilitate modifiability, avoid stating requirements
            redundantly. Repeating a requirement in multiple places where it
            logically belongs makes the document easier to read but harder to
            maintain (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>). The multiple instances of
            the requirement all have to be modified at the same time to avoid
            generating inconsistencies. Cross-reference related items in the
            SRS to help keep them synchronized when making changes. Storing
            individual requirements just once in a requirements management
            tool solves the redundancy problem and facilitates reuse of common
            requirements across multiple projects. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 18. Requirements reuse" href="#calibre_link-85">Chapter&nbsp;18</a> offers several strategies for

            that you don’t actually have to define all of these trace links
            for a requirement to have the properties that make it traceable.
            Traceable requirements are uniquely labeled with persistent
            identifiers. They are written in a structured, fine-grained way,
            not in long narrative paragraphs. Avoid combining multiple
            requirements together into a single statement, because the

        requirements. Receiving constructive feedback from colleagues with
        sharp eyes is a great help because you can learn where your writing
        did and didn’t hit the mark. This is why peer reviews of requirements
        documents are so critical. To get started with reviews, buddy up with
        a fellow business analyst and begin exchanging requirements for
        review. You’ll learn from seeing how another BA writes requirements,
        and you’ll improve the team’s collective work by discovering errors
        and improvement opportunities as early as possible. The following
        sections provide numerous tips for writing requirements&mdash;particularly
        functional requirements&mdash;that readers can clearly understand. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-220">[ref143]</a>, <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-221">[ref005]</a>, and <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a> present many other recommendations and examples
        for writing good requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">When we say “writing requirements,” people immediately think of
        writing textual requirements in natural language. It’s better to
        mentally translate the phrase “writing requirements” to “representing
        requirements knowledge.” In many cases, alternative representation
        techniques can present information more effectively than can straight
        text (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>). The BA should choose an appropriate
        mix of communication methods that ensures a clear, shared
        understanding of both the stakeholder needs and the solution to be
        built.</p><p class="calibre3">The sample requirements presented here can always be improved
        upon, and there are always equivalent ways to state them. Two
        important goals of writing requirements are that:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Anyone who reads the requirement comes to the same
            interpretation as any other reader.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Each reader’s interpretation matches what the author
            intended to communicate.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">These outcomes are more important than purity of style or
        conforming dogmatically to some arbitrary rule or convention.</p><div class="book" title="System or user perspective"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2953">System or user perspective</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">You can write functional requirements from the perspective of
          either something the system does or something the user can do.
          Because effective communication is the overarching goal, it’s fine
          to intermingle these styles, phrasing each requirement in whichever
          style is clearer. State requirements in a consistent fashion, such
          as “The system shall” or “The user shall,” followed by an action
          verb, followed by the observable result. Specify the trigger action
          or condition that causes the system to perform the specified
          behavior. A generic template for a requirement written from the
          system’s perspective is (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-222">[ref163]</a>):</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">[optional precondition] [optional trigger event]
            the system shall [expected system response].</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">This template is from the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax
          (EARS). EARS also includes additional template constructs for
          event-driven, unwanted behavior, state-driven, optional, and complex
          requirements. Following is an example of a simple functional
          requirement that describes a system action using this
          template:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-863" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1057" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1341" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1573" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1577" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2250" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">If the requested chemical is found in the
            chemical stockroom, the system shall display a list of all
            containers of the chemical that are currently in the
            stockroom.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">This example includes a precondition, but not a trigger. Some
          requirement writers would omit the phrase “the system shall” from
          this requirement. They argue that, because the requirements are
          describing system behavior, there’s no need to repetitively say “the
          system shall” do this or that. In this example, deleting “the system
          shall” is not confusing. Sometimes, though, it’s more natural to
          phrase the requirement in terms of a user’s action, not from the
          system’s perspective. Including the “shall” and writing in the
          active voice makes it clear what entity is taking the action
          described.</p><p class="calibre3">When writing functional requirements from the user’s
          perspective, the following general structure works well (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-221">[ref005]</a>):</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">The [user class or actor name] shall be able to
            [do something] [to some object] [qualifying conditions, response
            time, or quality statement].</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">Alternative phrasings are “The system shall let (or allow,
          permit, or enable) the [a particular user class name] to [do
          something].” Following is an example of a functional requirement
          written from the user’s perspective:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">The Chemist shall be able to reorder any chemical
            he has ordered in the past by retrieving and editing the order
            details.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">Notice how this requirement uses the name of the user
          class&mdash;Chemist&mdash;in place of the generic “user.” Making the requirement
          as explicit as possible reduces the possibility of
          misinterpretation.</p></div><div class="book" title="Writing style"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2954">Writing style</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Writing requirements isn’t like writing either fiction or
          other types of nonfiction. The writing style you might have learned
          in school in which you present the main idea, then supporting facts,
          then the conclusion, doesn’t work well. Adjust your writing style to
          put the punch line&mdash;the statement of need or functionality&mdash;first,
          followed by supporting details (rationale, origin, priority, and
          other requirement attributes). This structure helps readers who are
          just skimming through a document, while still being useful for those
          thorough readers who need all the details. Including tables,
          structured lists, diagrams, and other visual elements helps to break
          up a monotonous litany of functional requirements and provides
          richer communication to those who learn best in different
          ways.</p><p class="calibre3">Nor are requirements documents the place to practice your
          creative writing skills. Avoid interleaving passive and active voice
          in an attempt to make the material more interesting to read. Don’t
          use multiple terms for the same concept just to achieve variety
          (customer, account, patron, user, client). Being easy to read and
          understand is an essential element of well-written requirements;
          being interesting is, frankly, less important. If you are not a
          skilled writer, you should expect that your readers might not
          understand what you intend to convey. Keep the tips that follow in
          mind as you craft your requirements statements for maximum
          communication effectiveness.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1304" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1307" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2119" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Clarity and
          conciseness</strong></span> Write requirements in complete sentences
          using proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Keep sentences and
          paragraphs short and direct. Write requirements in simple and
          straightforward language appropriate to the user domain, avoiding
          jargon. Define specialized terms in a glossary.</p><p class="calibre3">Another good guideline is to write concisely. Phrases like
          “needs to provide the user with the capability to” can be condensed
          to “shall.” For each piece of information in the requirements set,
          ask yourself, “What would the reader do with this information?” If
          you aren’t certain that some stakeholder would find that information
          valuable, perhaps you don’t need it. Clarity is more important than
          conciseness, though.</p><p class="calibre3">Precisely stated requirements increase the chance of people
          receiving what they expect; less specific requirements offer the
          developer more latitude for interpretation. Sometimes that lack of
          specificity is fine, but in other cases it can lead to too much
          variability in the outcome. If a developer who reviews the SRS isn’t
          clear on the customer’s intent, consider including additional
          information to reduce the risk of problems later on.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">The keyword “shall”</strong></span> A
          traditional convention is to use the keyword “shall” to describe
          some system capability. People sometimes object to the word “shall.”
          “That’s not how people talk,” they protest. So what? “Shall”
          statements clearly indicate the desired functionality, consistent
          with your overarching objective of clear and effective
          communication. You might prefer to say “must,” “needs to,” or
          something similar, but be consistent. I sometimes read
          specifications that contain a random and confusing mix of
          requirements verbs: shall, must, may, might, will, would, should,
          could, needs to, has to, should provide, and others. I never know if
          there are differences between the meanings of these or not. Nuances
          between different verbs also make the document far more difficult
          for cross-cultural teams to interpret consistently. You’re better
          off sticking with a keyword such as “shall.”</p><p class="calibre3">Some requirement authors deliberately use different verbs to
          imply subtle distinctions. They use certain keywords to connote
          priority: “shall” means required, “should” means desired, and “may”
          means optional (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-37">[ref124]</a>). We regard such
          conventions as dangerous. It’s clearer to always say “shall” or
          “must” and explicitly assign high, medium, or low priority to each
          requirement. Also, priorities will change as iterations proceed, so
          don’t tie them to the phrasing of the requirements. Today’s “must”
          could become tomorrow’s “should.” Other authors use “shall” to
          indicate a requirement and “will” to denote a design expectation.
          Such conventions run the risk of some readers not understanding the
          distinctions between words people use interchangeably in everyday
          conversation; they are best avoided.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-2955" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">One witty consultant suggested that you mentally replace
            each instance of “should” with “probably won’t.” Would the
            resulting requirement be acceptable? If not, replace “should” with
            something more precise.</p></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-550" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Active voice</strong></span> Write
          in the active voice to make it clear what entity is taking the
          action described. Much business and scientific writing is in the
          passive voice, but it is never as clear and direct as using the
          active voice. The following requirement is written in passive
          voice:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Upon product upgrade shipment, the serial number
            will be updated on the contract line.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">The phrasing “will be updated” is indicative of passive voice.
          It denotes the recipient of the action (serial number) but not the
          performer of the action. That is, this phrasing offers no clue as to
          who or what updates the serial number. Will the system do that
          automatically, or is the user expected to update the serial number?
          Rephrasing this requirement into active voice makes the actor
          explicit and also clarifies the triggering event:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">When Fulfillment confirms that they shipped a
            product upgrade, the system shall update the customer’s contract
            with the new product serial number.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Individual requirements</strong></span>
          Avoid writing long narrative paragraphs that contain multiple
          requirements. Readers shouldn’t have to glean the individual
          requirements embedded in a mass of free-flowing descriptive
          language. Clearly distinguish individual requirements from
          background or contextual information. Such information is valuable
          to readers, but they need to unambiguously recognize the actual
          requirement statements. I once reviewed a large requirements
          specification written in the form of long paragraphs. I could read a
          full page and understand it, but I had to work hard to pick out the
          discrete requirements. Other readers might well come to different
          conclusions of exactly what requirements were lurking in that mass
          of text.</p><p class="calibre3">Words such as “and,” “or,” “additionally,” or “also” in a
          requirement suggest that several requirements might have been
          combined. This doesn’t mean you can’t use “and” in a requirement;
          just make sure the conjunction is joining two parts of a single
          requirement instead of two separate requirements. If you would use
          different tests to verify the two parts, split the sentence into
          separate requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">Avoid using “and/or” in a requirement; it leaves the
          interpretation up to the reader, as in this case:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">The system must permit search by order number,
            invoice number, and/or customer purchase order
            number.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">This requirement would permit the user to enter one, two, or
          three numbers at once when performing a single search. That might
          not be what’s intended.</p><p class="calibre3">The words “unless,” “except,” and “but” also indicate the
          presence of multiple requirements:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">The Buyer’s credit card on file shall be charged
            for payment, unless the credit card has expired.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">Failing to specify what happens when the “unless” clause is
          true is a common source of missing requirements. Split this into two
          requirements to address the behavior for the two conditions of the
          credit card being active and expired:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-1006" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1049" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">If the Buyer’s credit card on file is

            the system shall allow the Buyer to either update the current
            credit card information or enter a new credit card for
            payment.</em></span></p></blockquote></div></div><div class="book" title="Level of detail"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2956">Level of detail</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Requirements need to be specified at a level of precision that

          important part of requirements analysis is to decompose a high-level
          requirement into sufficient detail to clarify it and flesh it out.
          There’s no single correct answer to the commonly asked question,
          “How detailed should the requirements be?” Provide enough specifics
          to minimize the risk of misunderstanding, based on the development
          team’s knowledge and experience. The fewer the opportunities for
          ongoing discussion about requirements issues, the more specifics you
          need to record in the requirements set. If a developer can think of
          several possible ways to satisfy a requirement and all are
          acceptable, the specificity and detail are about right. You should
          include more detail when (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>):</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The work is being done for an external client.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Development or testing will be outsourced.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Project team members are geographically dispersed.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">System testing will be based on requirements.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Accurate estimates are needed.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Requirements traceability is needed.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">It’s safe to include less detail when:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The work is being done internally for your company.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Customers are extensively involved.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Developers have considerable domain experience.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Precedents are available, as when a previous application

          Requirement authors often struggle to find the right level of
          granularity for writing functional requirements. It’s not necessary
          to specify all of your requirements to the same level of detail. For
          example, you might go into more depth in an area that presents
          higher risk than others. Within a set of related requirements,
          though, it’s a good idea to try to write functional requirements at
          a consistent level of granularity.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1051" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1919" class="calibre"></a>A helpful guideline is to write individually testable
          requirements. The count of testable requirements has even been
          proposed as a metric for software product size (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-223">[ref252]</a>). If you can think of a small number of related
          test cases to verify that a requirement was correctly implemented,
          it’s probably at an appropriate granularity. If you envision
          numerous and diverse tests, perhaps several requirements are
          combined and ought to be separated.</p><p class="calibre3">I’ve seen requirement statements in the same SRS that varied
          widely in their scope. For instance, the following two functions
          were split out as separate requirements:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><div class="book"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">The system shall interpret the keystroke
                combination Ctrl+S as File Save.</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem" value="2"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">The system shall interpret the keystroke
                combination Ctrl+P as File Print.</em></span></p></li></ol></div></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">These requirements are very fine-grained. They will need few
          tests for verification of correct behavior. You can imagine a
          tediously long list of similar requirements, which would better be
          expressed in the form of a table that lists all the keystroke
          shortcuts and how the system interprets them.</p><p class="calibre3">However, that same SRS also contained a functional requirement
          that seemed rather large in scope:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">The product shall respond to editing directives
            entered by voice.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">This single requirement&mdash;seemingly no larger or smaller than
          all the others in the SRS&mdash;stipulated the inclusion of a complex
          speech-recognition subsystem&mdash;virtually an entire product in its own
          right! Verifying this one requirement in the working system could
          require hundreds of tests. The requirement as stated here could be
          appropriate at the high level of abstraction found in a vision
          statement or a market requirements document, but the
          speech-recognition requirement clearly demands much more
          functionality detail.</p></div><div class="book" title="Representation techniques"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-2957">Representation techniques</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Readers’ eyes glaze over when confronting a dense mass of
          turgid text or a long list of similar-looking requirements. Consider
          the most effective way to communicate each requirement to the
          intended audience. Some alternatives to the natural language
          requirements that we’re used to are lists, tables, visual analysis
          models, charts, mathematical formulas, photographs, sound clips, and
          video clips. These won’t suffice as substitutes for written
          requirements in many cases, but they serve as excellent supplemental
          information to enhance the reader’s understanding.</p><p class="calibre3">I once saw a set of requirements that fit the following
          pattern:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">The Text Editor shall be able to parse
            &lt;format&gt; documents that define &lt;jurisdiction&gt;
            laws.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">There were 3 possible values for
          &lt;<span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">format</em></span>&gt; and 4 possible values for
          &lt;<span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">jurisdiction</em></span>&gt;, for a total of 12 similar
          requirements. The SRS did indeed contain 12 such requirements, but
          one of the combinations was missing and another was duplicated. You
          can prevent such errors by representing these types of requirements
          in a table, which is more compact and less boring than a
          requirements list. The generic requirement could be stated
          as:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4"><span class="calibre"><strong class="bolditalic">Editor.DocFormat</strong></span> The Text Editor shall be

          author. The analyst might believe that a requirement he has written
          is crystal clear, free from ambiguities and other problems. However,
          if a reader has questions, the requirement needs additional work.
          Peer reviews are the best way to find places where the requirements
          aren’t clearly understood by all the intended audiences. This
          section describes several common sources of requirements
          ambiguity.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Fuzzy words</strong></span> Use terms
          consistently and as defined in the glossary. Watch out for synonyms
          and near-synonyms. I know of one project where four different terms
          were used to refer to the same item in a single requirements
          document. Pick a single term and use it consistently, placing
          synonyms in the glossary so people who are accustomed to calling the
          item by a different name see the connection.</p><p class="calibre3">If you use a pronoun to refer to something mentioned earlier,
          make sure the antecedent is crystal clear. Adverbs introduce
          subjectivity and hence ambiguity. Avoid words like
          <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">reasonably, appropriately, generally, approximately,
          usually, systematically</em></span>, and <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">quickly</em></span>
          because the reader won’t be sure how to interpret them.</p><p class="calibre3">Ambiguous language leads to unverifiable requirements, so

          requirements specifications include expressions in the form “A/B,”
          in which two related (or synonymous, or opposite) terms are combined
          with a slash. Such expressions frequently are ambiguous. Here’s an
          example:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">The system shall provide automated information
            collection of license key data for a mass release from the
            Delivery/Fulfillment Team.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">This sentence could be interpreted in several ways:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The name of the team is Delivery/Fulfillment.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Delivery and fulfillment are synonyms.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Some projects call the group a Delivery Team; others call
              it a Fulfillment Team.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Either the Delivery Team or the Fulfillment Team can do a
              mass release, so the slash means “or.”</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The Delivery Team and the Fulfillment Team jointly do a
              mass release, so the slash means “and.”</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Sometimes authors use the A/B construct because they aren’t
          sure exactly what they have in mind. Unfortunately, this means that
          each reader gets to interpret the requirement to mean whatever he
          thinks it ought to mean. It’s better to decide exactly what you
          intend to say and choose the right words.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Boundary values</strong></span> Many
          ambiguities occur at the boundaries of numerical ranges in both
          requirements and business rules. Consider the following:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Vacation requests of up to 5 days do not require
            approval. Vacation requests of 5 to 10 days require supervisor
            approval. Vacation requests of 10 days or longer require
            management approval.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">This phrasing makes it unclear as to which category vacation
          requests of exactly 5 days and exactly 10 days belong. It gets even
          more confusing if fractions are involved, like 5.5 days of vacation.
          The words “through,” “inclusive,” and “exclusive” make it totally
          clear whether the endpoints of the numerical range lie inside or
          outside the range:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Vacation requests of 5 or fewer days do not
            require approval. Vacation requests of longer than 5 days through

          requirements</strong></span> People sometimes write requirements that say

          <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">will</em></span> do. How do you implement a don’t-do-this
          requirement? Double and triple negatives are particularly tricky to
          decipher. Try to rephrase negative requirements into a positive
          sense that clearly describes the restricting behavior. Here’s an
          example:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Prevent the user from activating the contract if
            the contract is not in balance.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">Consider rephrasing this double negative (“prevent” and “not
          in balance”) as a positive statement:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">The system shall allow the user to activate the
            contract only if the contract is in balance.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">Instead of using negative requirements to indicate that
          certain functionality is out of scope, include the restriction in
          the Limitations and Exclusions section of the vision and scope
          document, as described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 5. Establishing the business requirements" href="#calibre_link-32">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>. If a specific
          requirement was once in scope but then removed, you don’t want to
          lose sight of it&mdash;it might come back someday. If you are maintaining
          requirements in a document, use strikethrough formatting to indicate
          a deleted requirement. The best way to handle such deleted
          requirements is with a requirements status attribute in a
          requirements management tool (see <a class="xref" title="Chapter 27. Requirements management practices" href="#calibre_link-89">Chapter&nbsp;27</a> for more about

          several ways to identify missing requirements. Focusing elicitation

            point during manual contract setup.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">Nowhere in the rest of the specification did I find a
          requirement to allow the user to retrieve an incomplete but saved
          contract to work on it further: perhaps a requirement was missing.
          Nor was it clear whether the system should validate the data entries
          in the incomplete contract before saving it. An implied requirement?
          Developers need to know.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Complex logic</strong></span> Compound

          specification only addressed this one combination. It didn’t say
          what should happen if:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The Premium plan is selected and proof of insurance is not
              provided.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1046" class="calibre"></a>The Premium plan is selected and proof of

              provided.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">The reader is forced to conclude that the system doesn’t take
          any action for those three other conditions. That might be correct,
          but it’s better to make such conclusions explicit rather than
          implicit. Use decision tables or decision trees to represent complex
          logic and ensure that you have not missed any variants.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Missing exceptions</strong></span> Each
          requirement that states how the system should work when everything
          is correct should also have accompanying requirements as necessary
          to describe how the system should respond when exceptions occur.
          Consider the following requirement:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">If the user is working in an existing file and
            chooses to save the file, the system shall save it with the same
            name.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">This requirement alone does not indicate what the system
          should do if it’s unable to save the file with the same name. An
          appropriate second requirement to go with the first might be:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">If the system is unable to save a file using a
            specific name, the system shall give the user the option to save
            it with a different name or to cancel the save
            operation.</em></span></p></blockquote></div></div></div><div class="book" title="Sample requirements, before and after"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2960">Sample requirements, before and after</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">This chapter opened with several characteristics of high-quality
        requirements. Requirements that don’t exhibit these characteristics
        cause confusion, wasted effort, and rework later, so strive to correct
        any problems early. Following are several functional requirements
        adapted from real projects that are less than ideal. Examine each
        statement for those quality characteristics to see whether you can
        spot the problems. Verifiability is a good starting point. If you
        can’t devise tests to tell whether the requirement was correctly
        implemented, it’s probably ambiguous or lacks necessary
        information.</p><p class="calibre3">For each example, we present some observations about the
        problems with these requirements and suggested improvements.
        Additional reviews would no doubt improve them further, but at some
        point you need to write software. More examples of rewriting poor
        requirements are available from <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-226">[ref110]</a>, <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-227">[ref074]</a>, <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-221">[ref005]</a>, and <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>. Note that pulling requirements out of context
        like this shows them at their worst. These might well make more sense
        in their original environment. We also assume that business analysts
        (and all other team members) come to work each day to do the best job
        they can, based on what they know at the moment, so we’re not picking
        on the original authors here.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-2961" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Watch out for analysis paralysis. All of the sample “after”
          requirements in this chapter can be improved further, but you can’t
          spend forever trying to perfect the requirements. Remember, your
          goal is to write requirements that are <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">good
          enough</em></span> to let your team proceed with design and
          construction at an acceptable level of risk.</p></div><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Example 1</strong></span> <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">The
        Background Task Manager shall provide status messages at regular
        intervals not less than every 60 seconds.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">What are the status messages? Under what conditions and in what
        fashion are they provided to the user? If displayed on the screen, how
        long do they remain visible? Is it okay if they just flash up for half
        a second? The timing interval is not clear, and the word “every” just
        muddles the issue. One way to evaluate a requirement is to see whether
        a ludicrous but legitimate interpretation is all right with the user.
        If not, the requirement needs more work. In this example, is the
        interval between status messages supposed to be <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">at
        least</em></span> 60 seconds, so providing a new message once per year
        is okay? Alternatively, if the intent is to have <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">at
        most</em></span> 60 seconds elapse between messages, would one
        millisecond be too short an interval? These extreme interpretations
        might be consistent with the original requirement, but they certainly
        aren’t what the user had in mind. Because of these problems, this
        requirement is not verifiable.</p><p class="calibre3">Here’s one way to rewrite the preceding requirement to address
        those shortcomings, after we get some more information from the
        customer:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">1. The Background Task Manager (BTM) shall display
          status messages in a designated area of the user
          interface.</em></span></p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">1.1. The BTM shall update the messages every 60 plus
          or minus 5 seconds after background task processing
          begins.</em></span></p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">1.2. The messages shall remain visible continuously
          during background processing.</em></span></p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">1.3. The BTM shall display the percent of the
          background task that is completed.</em></span></p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">1.4. The BTM shall display a “Done” message when the
          background task is completed.</em></span></p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">1.5. The BTM shall display a message if the
          background task has stalled.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">Rewriting a flawed requirement often makes it longer because
        information was missing. Splitting this into multiple child
        requirements makes sense because each will demand separate tests. This
        also makes each one individually traceable. There would likely be
        additional status messages that the BTM might display. If those are
        documented someplace else, such as in an interface specification,
        incorporate that information here by reference instead of replicating
        it. Listing the messages in a table of conditions and corresponding
        messages would be more concise than writing numerous functional
        requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">The revised requirements don’t specify how the status messages
        will be displayed, just “in a designated area of the user interface.”
        Such wording defers the placement of the messages to being a design
        issue, which is fine in many cases. If you specify the display
        location in the requirements, it becomes a design constraint placed on
        the developer. Unnecessarily constrained design options frustrate the
        programmers and can result in a suboptimal product design.</p><p class="calibre3">Suppose, though, that we’re adding this functionality to an
        existing application whose user interface already contains a status
        bar, where users are accustomed to seeing important messages. For
        consistency with the rest of the application it would make perfect
        sense to stipulate that the BTM’s status messages shall appear in the
        status bar. That is, you might deliberately impose the design
        constraint for a very good reason.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Example 2</strong></span> <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Corporate
        project charge numbers should be validated online against the master
        corporate charge number list, if possible.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">The phrase “if possible” is ambiguous. Does it mean “if it’s
        technically feasible” (a question for the developer) or “if the master
        charge number list can be accessed at run time”? If you aren’t sure
        whether a requested capability can be delivered, use TBD to indicate
        that the issue is unresolved. After investigation, either the TBD goes
        away or the requirement goes away. This requirement doesn’t specify
        what to do when the validation either passes or fails. Also, avoid
        imprecise words such as “should.” Here’s a revised version of this
        requirement:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">At the time the requester enters a charge number,
          the system shall display an error message if the charge number is
          not in the master corporate charge number list.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">A related requirement would address the exception condition of
        the master corporate charge number list not being available at the
        time the validation was attempted.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Example 3</strong></span> <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">The
        device tester shall allow the user to easily connect additional
        components, including a pulse generator, a voltmeter, a capacitance
        meter, and custom probe cards.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">This requirement is for a product containing embedded software
        that’s used to test several kinds of measurement devices. The word
        “easily” implies a usability requirement, but it is neither measurable
        nor verifiable. “Including” doesn’t make it clear whether this is the
        complete list of external devices that must be connected to the
        tester. Perhaps there are many others that we don’t know about.
        Consider the following alternative requirements, which contain some
        intentional design constraints:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><div class="book"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">The device tester shall incorporate a USB port
              to allow the user to connect any measurement device that has a
              USB connection.</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem" value="2"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">The USB port shall be installed on the front
              panel to permit a trained operator to connect a measurement
              device in 10 seconds or less.</em></span></p></li></ol></div></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">A business analyst shouldn’t rewrite requirements in a way that
        imposes design constraints on his own initiative. Instead, detect the
        flawed requirements and discuss them with the appropriate stakeholders
        so they can be clarified.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Example 4</strong></span> <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">The
        system must check for inconsistencies in account data between the
        Active Account Log and the Account Manager archive. The logic that is
        used to generate these comparisons should be based on the logic in the
        existing consistency checker tool. In other words, the new code does
        not need to be developed from scratch. The developers should utilize
        the current consistency checker code as the foundation. However,
        additional logic must be added to identify which database is the
        authoritative source. The new functionality will include writing data
        to holding tables to indicate how/where to resolve inconsistencies.
        Additionally, the code should also check for exception scenarios
        against the security tools database. Automated email alerts should be
        sent to the Security Compliance Team whenever discrepancies are
        found.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">This is a good one for you to practice on. We’ll point out some

            different between the new system and the existing tool? What

      was holding its first detailed requirements review. The participants
      were Dave (project manager), Lori (business analyst), Helen (lead
      developer), Ramesh (test lead), Tim (product champion for the chemists),
      and Roxanne (product champion for the chemical stockroom staff). Tim
      began by saying, “I read the whole document. Most of the requirements
      seemed okay to me, but I had a hard time digesting the long lists of
      requirements in a few sections. I’m not sure whether we identified all
      the steps in the chemical request process.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“It was hard for me to think of all the tests that I’ll
      need to cover the status changes for a request,” Ramesh added. “I found
      a bunch of requirements sprinkled throughout the document about the
      status changes, but I couldn’t tell whether any were missing. A couple
      of requirements seemed to conflict.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Roxanne had a similar problem. “I got confused when I
      read about the way I would actually request a chemical,” she said. “I
      had trouble visualizing the sequence of steps I would go
      through.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">After the reviewers raised several other concerns, Lori
      concluded, “It looks like this document doesn’t tell us everything we
      need to know about the system. I’ll create some diagrams to help us
      visualize the requirements and see whether that clarifies these problem
      areas. Thanks for the feedback.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">As requirements authority Alan Davis pointed out, no single view
      of the requirements provides a complete understanding (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-55">[ref055]</a>). You need a combination of textual and visual
      requirements representations at different levels of abstraction to paint
      a full picture of the intended system. Requirements views can include
      functional requirements lists, tables, visual analysis models, user
      interface prototypes, acceptance tests, decision trees, decision tables,
      photographs, videos, and mathematical expressions (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>). Ideally, different people will create various
      requirements representations. The business analyst might write the
      functional requirements and draw some models, whereas the user interface
      designer builds a prototype and the test lead writes test cases.
      Comparing the requirements representations created through diverse
      thought processes and diverse notations reveals inconsistencies,
      ambiguities, assumptions, and omissions that are difficult to spot from
      any single view.</p><p class="calibre3">Diagrams communicate certain types of information more efficiently
      than text can. Pictures help bridge language and vocabulary barriers
      among team members. The BA initially might need to explain the purpose
      of the models and the notations used to other stakeholders. There are
      many different diagrams and modeling techniques to choose from to create
      visual representations of the requirements. This chapter introduces
      several requirements modeling techniques, with illustrations and
      pointers to other sources for further details.</p><div class="book" title="Modeling the requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2964">Modeling the requirements</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1097" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1250" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1291" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1492" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1536" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1543" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2320" class="calibre"></a>Business analysts might hope to find one technique that
        pulls everything together into a holistic depiction of a system’s
        requirements. Unfortunately, there is no such all-encompassing
        diagram. In fact, if you could model the entire system in a single
        diagram, that diagram would be just as unusable as a long list of
        requirements on its own. An early goal of structured systems analysis
        was to replace the classical functional specification with diagrams
        and notations that are more formal than narrative text. However,
        experience has shown that analysis models should augment&mdash;rather than
        replace&mdash;a requirements specification written in natural language.
        Developers and testers still benefit from the detail and precision
        that written requirements offer.</p><p class="calibre3">Visual requirements models can help you identify missing,
        extraneous, and inconsistent requirements. Given the limitations of
        human short-term memory, analyzing a list of one thousand requirements
        for inconsistencies, duplication, and extraneous requirements is
        nearly impossible. By the time you reach the fifteenth requirement,
        you have likely forgotten the first few that you read. You’re unlikely
        to find all of the errors simply by reviewing the textual
        requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">Visual requirements models described in this book

        requirements, as well as for designing software solutions. Whether you
        are using them for analysis or for design depends on the timing and
        the intent of the modeling. Used for requirements analysis, these
        diagrams let you model the problem domain or create conceptual
        representations of the new system. They depict the logical aspects of
        the problem domain’s data components, transactions and
        transformations, real-world objects, and changes in system state. You
        can base the models on the textual requirements to represent them from
        different perspectives, or you can derive functional requirements from
        high-level models that are based on user input. During design, models
        represent how you intend to implement the system: the actual database
        to create, the object classes to instantiate, and the code modules to
        develop. Because analysis and design diagrams use the same notations,
        clearly identify each one you draw as being an analysis model (the
        concepts) or a design model (what you intend to build).</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1000" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1284" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1514" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2480" class="calibre"></a>The analysis modeling techniques described in this
        chapter are supported by a variety of commercial modeling tools,
        requirements management tools, and drawing tools such as Microsoft
        Visio. Specialized modeling tools provide several benefits over
        general-purpose drawing tools. First, they make it easy to improve the
        diagrams through iteration. You’ll almost never get a model right the
        first time through, so iteration is a key to modeling success. Tools
        can also enforce the rules for each modeling method they support. They
        can identify syntax errors and inconsistencies that people who review
        the diagrams might not see. Requirements management tools that support
        modeling allow you to trace requirements to the models. Some tools
        link multiple diagrams together and to their related functional and
        data requirements. Using a tool with standard symbols can help you
        keep the models consistent with each other.</p><p class="calibre3">We hear arguments against using requirements models that range
        from “Our system is too complex to model” to “We have a tight project
        schedule; there is no time to model the requirements.” A model is
        simpler than the system you are modeling. If you cannot handle the
        complexity of the model, how will you be able to handle the complexity
        of the system? Creating most models doesn’t require significantly more
        time than you would spend writing the requirements statements and
        analyzing them for issues. Any extra time spent using requirements
        analysis models should be more than made up for by catching
        requirements errors prior to building the system. Models, or portions
        of models, can sometimes be reused from one project to another, or at
        least serve as a straw-man starting point for requirements elicitation
        on a subsequent project.</p></div><div class="book" title="From voice of the customer to analysis models"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2965">From voice of the customer to analysis models</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">By listening carefully to how customers present their

        analysis models for an entire system. Focus your modeling on the most
        complex and riskiest portions of the system and on those portions most
        subject to ambiguity or uncertainty. Safety-critical,
        security-critical, and mission-critical system elements are good
        candidates for modeling because the impact of defects in those areas
        is so severe. Also choose models to use together to help ensure all of
        the models are complete. For example, examining the data objects in a
        DFD can uncover missing entities in an ERD. Considering all the
        processes in a DFD might identify useful swimlane diagrams to create.

        structured analysis (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-232">[ref059]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-123">[ref200]</a>). A DFD identifies the transformational processes
        of a system, the collections (stores) of data or physical materials
        that the system manipulates, and the flows of data or material between
        processes, stores, and the outside world. Data flow modeling takes a
        functional decomposition approach to systems analysis, breaking
        complex problems into progressive levels of detail. This works well
        for transaction-processing systems and other function-intensive
        applications. Through the addition of control flow elements, the DFD
        technique has been extended to permit modeling of real-time systems
        (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-233">[ref106]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-887" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1099" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1198" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1252" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1293" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1494" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1538" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2322" class="calibre"></a>DFDs provide a big-picture view of how data moves
        through a system, which other models don’t show well. Various people
        and systems execute processes that use, manipulate, and produce data,
        so any single use case or swimlane diagram can’t show you the full
        life cycle of a piece of data. Also, multiple pieces of data might be
        pulled together and transformed by a process (for example, shopping
        cart contents plus shipping information plus billing information are
        transformed into an order object). Again, this is hard to show in
        other models. However, DFDs do not suffice as a sole modeling
        technique. The details about how the data is transformed are better
        shown by steps in a process using use cases or swimlane
        diagrams.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-42">[ref013]</a> suggest tips for creating DFDs and
        using DFDs for requirements analysis. This tool is often used when
        interviewing customers, because it’s easy to scribble a DFD on a
        whiteboard while discussing how the user’s business operates. DFDs can
        be used as a technique to identify missing data requirements. The data
        that flows between processes, data stores, and external entities
        should also be modeled in ERDs and described in the data dictionary.
        Also, a DFD gives context to the functional requirements regarding how
        the user performs specific tasks, such as requesting a
        chemical.</p><p class="calibre3">Data flow diagrams can represent systems over a wide range of
        abstraction. High-level DFDs provide a holistic, bird’s-eye view of
        the data and processing components in a multistep activity, which
        complements the precise, detailed view embodied in the functional
        requirements. The context diagram in <a class="xref" title="Figure 5-6. Partial context diagram for the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-124">Figure&nbsp;5-6</a> in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 5. Establishing the business requirements" href="#calibre_link-32">Chapter&nbsp;5</a> represents the
        highest level of abstraction of the DFD. The context diagram
        represents the entire system as a single black-box process, depicted
        as a circle (a <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">bubble</em></span>). It also shows the
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">external entities</em></span>, or terminators, that connect
        to the system, and the data or material flows between the system and
        the external entities. Flows on a context diagram often represent
        complex data structures, which are defined in the data
        dictionary.</p><p class="calibre3">You can elaborate the context diagram into a level 0 DFD (the
        highest level of a data flow model), which partitions the system into
        its major processes. <a class="xref" title="Figure 12-1. Partial level 0 data flow diagram for the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-234">Figure&nbsp;12-1</a> shows a partial
        level 0 DFD for the Chemical Tracking System. This model uses the
        Yourdon-DeMarco DFD notation. There are alternative notations that use
        slightly different symbols.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-234" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2971" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000047.jpeg" alt="Partial level 0 data flow diagram for the Chemical Tracking System." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;12-1.&nbsp;Partial level 0 data flow diagram for the Chemical Tracking
          System.</div></div><p class="calibre3">The single circle that represented the entire Chemical Tracking
        System on the context diagram has been subdivided into six major
        processes (the process bubbles). As with the context diagram, the
        external entities are shown in rectangles. All data flows (arrows)
        from the context diagram also appear on the level 0 DFD. In addition,
        the level 0 diagram contains several <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">data stores</em></span>,
        depicted as a pair of parallel horizontal lines, which are internal to
        the system and therefore do not appear on the context diagram. A flow
        from a bubble to a store indicates that data is being placed into the
        store, a flow out of the store shows a read operation, and a
        bidirectional arrow between a store and a bubble indicates an update
        operation.</p><p class="calibre3">Each process that appears as a separate bubble on the level 0
        diagram can be further expanded into a separate DFD to reveal more
        detail about its functioning. The BA continues this progressive
        refinement until the lowest-level diagrams contain only primitive
        process operations that can be clearly represented in narrative text,
        pseudocode, a swimlane diagram, or an activity diagram. The functional
        requirements will define precisely what happens within each primitive
        process. Each level of the DFD must be balanced and consistent with
        the level above it so that all the input and output flows on the child
        diagram match up with flows on its parent. Complex data structures in
        the high-level diagrams might be split into their constituent
        elements, as defined in the data dictionary, on the lower-level
        DFDs.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 12-1. Partial level 0 data flow diagram for the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-234">Figure&nbsp;12-1</a>
        looks complex at first glance. However, if you examine the immediate
        environment of any one process, you will see the data items that it
        consumes and produces and their sources and destinations. To see
        exactly how a process uses the data items, you’ll need to either draw
        a more detailed child DFD or refer to the functional requirements for
        that part of the system.</p><p class="calibre3">Following are several conventions for drawing data flow
        diagrams. Not everyone adheres to the same conventions (for example,
        some BAs show external entities only on the context diagram), but we
        find them helpful. Using the models to enhance communication among the
        project participants is more important than dogmatic conformance to
        these principles.</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Processes communicate through data stores, not by direct
            flows from one process to another. Similarly, data cannot flow
            directly from one store to another or directly between external
            entities and data stores; it must pass through a process
            bubble.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Don’t attempt to imply the processing sequence using the
            DFD.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Name each process as a concise action: verb plus object

            customers and pertinent to the business or problem domain.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Number the processes uniquely and hierarchically. On the
            level 0 diagram, number each process with an integer. If you

            child diagram 3.1, 3.2, and so on.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Don’t show more than 8 to 10 processes on a single diagram
            or it will be difficult to draw, change, and understand. If you
            have more processes, introduce another layer of abstraction by
            grouping related processes into a higher-level process.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Bubbles with flows that are only coming in or only going out
            are suspect. The processing that a DFD bubble represents normally

        sure that all the known and relevant data-manipulating processes are
        represented and that processes have no missing or unnecessary inputs
        or outputs. DFD reviews often reveal previously unrecognized user
        classes, business processes, and connections to other systems.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2972" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Modeling problems, not software</div><p class="calibre3">I once served as the IT representative on a team that was
          doing some business process reengineering. Our goal was to reduce
          the time that it took to make a new chemical available for use in a
          product by a factor of 10. The reengineering team included the
          following representatives of the various functions involved in
          chemical commercialization:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The synthetic chemist who first makes the new chemical

              large batches of the chemical</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The analytical chemist who devises techniques for

          believed would greatly accelerate the chemical commercialization
          activity and modeled it in a swimlane diagram. Then, I interviewed
          the person on the reengineering team who was responsible for each
          process step. I asked each owner two questions: “What information do
          you need to perform this step?” and “What information does this step
          produce that we should store?” When correlating the answers for all
          process steps, I found steps that needed data that no one had
          available. Other steps produced data that no one needed. We fixed
          all those problems.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2973" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1265" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1555" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2226" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2229" class="calibre"></a>Next, I drew a data flow diagram to illustrate the new

          the data relationships. A data dictionary (<a class="xref" title="Chapter 13. Specifying data requirements" href="#calibre_link-87">Chapter&nbsp;13</a>) defined all our data
          items. These analysis models served as useful communication tools to
          help the team members arrive at a common understanding of the new

          and specify the requirements for software applications that
          supported portions of the process.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Swimlane diagram"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2974">Swimlane diagram</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Swimlane diagrams</em></span> provide a way to
        represent the steps involved in a business process or the operations

        subdivided into visual subcomponents called
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">lanes.</em></span> The lanes can represent different systems
        or actors that execute the steps in the process. Swimlane diagrams are
        most commonly used to show business processes, workflows, or system
        and user interactions. They are similar to UML activity diagrams.
        Swimlane diagrams are sometimes called <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">cross-functional

        shows a partial swimlane diagram for the CTS. The swimlanes in this
        example are roles or departments, showing which group executes each
        step in the business process to order a chemical from a vendor. To
        identify functional requirements, you can start at the first box,
        “Create a chemical request,” and think about what functionality the
        system must have to support that step, as well as the data
        requirements for a “chemical request.” A later step to “Receive and
        approve invoice” might trigger the team to identify requirements for
        what it means to process an invoice. How is the invoice received? What
        is its format? Is the invoice processing manual, or does the system
        automate some or all of it? Does the data from the invoice get pushed
        to other systems?</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-236" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2975" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000048.jpeg" alt="Partial swimlane diagram for a process in the Chemical Tracking System." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;12-2.&nbsp;Partial swimlane diagram for a process in the Chemical

        scope of a software system. Notice that the Receiving department
        appears in the swimlane as part of the process, but it is not found in
        the context diagram or the DFD because the Receiving department will
        never interact with the CTS directly. Reviewing the ecosystem map
        shown in <a class="xref" title="Figure 5-7. Partial ecosystem map for the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-125">Figure&nbsp;5-7</a>

        both models consumed and produced the same data, correcting any errors

        behavior, data manipulation, and state changes. Real-time systems and
        process control applications can exist in one of a limited number of
        states at any given time. A state change can take place only when
        well-defined criteria are satisfied, such as receiving a specific
        input stimulus under certain conditions. An example is a highway
        intersection that incorporates vehicle sensors, protected turn lanes,
        and pedestrian crosswalk buttons and signals. Many information systems
        deal with business objects&mdash;sales orders, invoices, inventory items,
        and the like&mdash;with life cycles that involve a series of possible
        states, or statuses.</p><p class="calibre3">Describing a set of complex state changes in natural language
        creates a high probability of overlooking a permitted state change or
        including a disallowed change. Depending on how an SRS is organized,
        requirements that pertain to the state-driven behavior might be
        sprinkled throughout it. This makes it difficult to reach an overall
        understanding of the system’s behavior.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">State-transition diagrams</em></span> and
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">state tables</em></span> are two state models that provide a
        concise, complete, and unambiguous representation of the states of an
        object or system. The state-transition diagram (STD) shows the
        possible transitions between states visually. A related technique is
        the <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">state machine diagram</em></span> included in the Unified
        Modeling Language (UML), which has a richer set of notations and which
        models the states an object goes through during its lifetime (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-237">[ref006]</a>). The STD contains three types of elements:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Possible system states, shown as rectangles. Some notations
            use circles to represent the state (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-42">[ref013]</a>).

            place, shown as text labels on each transition arrow. The label

            response.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">The STD for an object that passes through a defined life cycle
        will have one or more termination states, which represent the final
        status values that an object can have. Termination states have
        transition arrows coming in, but none going out. Customers can learn
        to read an STD with just a little coaching about the notation&mdash;it’s
        just boxes and arrows.</p><p class="calibre3">Recall from <a class="xref" title="Chapter 8. Understanding user requirements" href="#calibre_link-35">Chapter&nbsp;8</a>
        that a primary function of the Chemical Tracking System is to permit
        actors called Requesters to place requests for chemicals, which can be
        fulfilled either from the chemical stockroom’s inventory or by placing
        orders to outside vendors. Each request will pass through a series of
        states between the time it’s created and the time it’s either
        fulfilled or canceled (the two termination states). Thus, an STD
        models the life cycle of a chemical request, as shown in <a class="xref" title="Figure 12-3. A partial state-transition diagram for a chemical request in the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-183">Figure&nbsp;12-3</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-183" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2977" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000049.jpeg" alt="A partial state-transition diagram for a chemical request in the Chemical Tracking System." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;12-3.&nbsp;A partial state-transition diagram for a chemical request in

        the initial chemical request STD, they identified one state that
        wasn’t needed, saw that another essential state was missing, and
        pointed out two incorrect transitions. No one had seen those errors
        when they reviewed the corresponding functional requirements. This
        underscores the value of representing requirements information at more
        than one level of abstraction. It’s often easier to spot a problem
        when you step back from the detailed level and see the big picture
        that an analysis model provides. However, the STD doesn’t provide
        enough detail for a developer to know what software to build.
        Therefore, the SRS for the Chemical Tracking System included the
        functional requirements associated with processing a chemical request
        and its possible state changes.</p><p class="calibre3">A state table shows all of the possible transitions between
        states in the form of a matrix. A business analyst can use state
        tables to ensure that all transitions are identified by analyzing
        every cell in the matrix. All states are written down the first column
        and repeated across the first row of the table. The cells indicate
        whether the transition from a state on the left to a state at the top
        is valid, and identifies the transition event to move between states.
        <a class="xref" title="Figure 12-4. State table for a chemical request in the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-238">Figure&nbsp;12-4</a> shows a
        state table that matches the state-transition diagram in <a class="xref" title="Figure 12-3. A partial state-transition diagram for a chemical request in the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-183">Figure&nbsp;12-3</a>. These two
        diagrams show exactly the same information, but the table format helps
        ensure that no transitions are missed, and the diagram format helps
        stakeholders visualize the possible sequences of transitions. You
        might not need to create both models. However, if you have created one
        already, the other is easy to create, if you do want to analyze the
        state changes from two perspectives. The two rows in <a class="xref" title="Figure 12-4. State table for a chemical request in the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-238">Figure&nbsp;12-4</a> in which the
        values are all “no” are both termination states; when the chemical
        request is in either the Fulfilled or the Canceled state, it cannot
        transition out of it.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-238" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2978" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000050.jpeg" alt="State table for a chemical request in the Chemical Tracking System." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;12-4.&nbsp;State table for a chemical request in the Chemical Tracking
          System.</div></div><p class="calibre3">The state-transition diagram and state table provide a
        high-level viewpoint that spans multiple use cases or user stories,
        each of which might perform a transition from one state to another.
        The state models don’t show the details of the processing that the
        system performs; they show only the possible state changes that result
        from that processing. They help developers understand the intended
        behavior of the system. The models facilitate early testing because
        testers can derive tests from the STD that cover all allowed
        transition paths. Both models are useful for ensuring that all the
        required states and transitions have been correctly and completely
        described in the functional requirements.</p></div><div class="book" title="Dialog map"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2979">Dialog map</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-875" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1013" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1390" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1463" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1521" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1567" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2423" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2426" class="calibre"></a>The <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">dialog map</em></span> represents a user
        interface design at a high level of abstraction. It shows the dialog
        elements in the system and the navigation links among them, but it
        doesn’t show the detailed screen designs. A user interface can be
        regarded as a series of state changes. Only one dialog element (such
        as a menu, workspace, dialog box, line prompt, or touch screen
        display) is available at any given time for user input. The user can
        navigate to certain other dialog elements based on the action he takes
        at the active input location. The number of possible navigation
        pathways can be large in a complex system, but the number is finite
        and the options are usually known. A dialog map is really just a user
        interface modeled in the form of a state-transition diagram (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-239">[ref238]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-66">[ref240]</a>). <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-240">[ref049]</a> describe a similar technique called a
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">navigation map</em></span>, which includes a richer set of
        notations for representing different types of interaction elements and
        context transitions. A <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">user interface flow</em></span> is
        similar to a dialog map but shows the navigation paths between user
        interface screens in a swimlane diagram format (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-42">[ref013]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3">A dialog map allows you to explore hypothetical user interface
        concepts based on your understanding of the requirements. Users and
        developers can study a dialog map to reach a common vision of how the
        user might interact with the system to perform a task. Dialog maps are
        also useful for modeling the visual architecture of a website.
        Navigation links that you build into the website appear as transitions
        on the dialog map. Of course, the user has additional navigation
        options through the browser’s Back and Forward buttons, as well as the
        URL input field, but the dialog map does not show those. Dialog maps
        are related to system storyboards, which also include a short
        description of each screen’s purpose (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-241">[ref158]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1100" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1253" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1266" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1294" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1495" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1539" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2323" class="calibre"></a>Dialog maps capture the essence of the user&ndash;system
        interactions and task flow without bogging the team down in detailed
        screen layouts. Users can trace through a dialog map to find missing,
        incorrect, or unnecessary navigations, and hence missing, incorrect,
        or unnecessary requirements. The abstract, conceptual dialog map
        formulated during requirements analysis serves as a guide during
        detailed user interface design.</p><p class="calibre3">Just as in ordinary state-transition diagrams, the dialog map
        shows each dialog element as a state (rectangle) and each allowed
        navigation option as a transition (arrow). The condition that triggers
        user interface navigation is shown as a text label on the transition
        arrow. There are several types of trigger conditions:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">A user action, such as pressing a function key, clicking on
            a hyperlink, or making a gesture on a touch screen.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">A data value, such as an invalid user input value that
            triggers an error message display</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">A system condition, such as detecting that a printer is out
            of paper</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Some combination of these, such as typing a menu option
            number and pressing the Enter key</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Dialog maps look a bit like flowcharts, but they serve a
        different purpose. A flowchart explicitly shows the processing steps
        and decision points, but not the user interface displays. In contrast,
        the dialog map does <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">not</em></span> show the processing that
        takes place along the transition lines that connect one dialog element
        to another. The branching decisions (usually user choices) are hidden
        behind the display screens that are shown as rectangles on the dialog
        map, and the conditions that lead to displaying one screen or another
        appear in the labels on the transitions.</p><p class="calibre3">To simplify the dialog map, omit global functions such as
        pressing the F1 key to bring up a help display from each dialog
        element. The SRS section on user interfaces should specify that this
        functionality will be available, but showing lots of help-screen boxes
        on the dialog map clutters the model while adding little value.
        Similarly, when modeling a website, you needn’t include standard
        navigation links that will appear on each page in the site. You can
        also omit the transitions that reverse the flow of a webpage
        navigation sequence because the web browser’s Back button handles that
        navigation.</p><p class="calibre3">A dialog map is an excellent way to represent the interactions
        between an actor and the system that a use case describes. The dialog
        map can depict alternative flows as branches off the normal flow. I
        found that sketching dialog map fragments on a whiteboard was helpful
        during use case elicitation workshops in which a team explored the
        sequence of actor actions and system responses that would lead to task
        completion. For use cases and process flows that are already complete,
        compare them to dialog maps to ensure that all the functions needed to
        execute the steps can be accessed in the UI navigation.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Chapter 8. Understanding user requirements" href="#calibre_link-35">Chapter&nbsp;8</a> presented a
        use case for the Chemical Tracking System called “Request a Chemical.”
        The normal flow for this use case involved requesting a chemical
        container from the chemical stockroom’s inventory. An alternative flow
        was to request the chemical from a vendor. The user placing the
        request wanted the option to view the history of the available
        stockroom containers of that chemical before selecting one. <a class="xref" title="Figure 12-5. A partial dialog map for the “Request a Chemical” use case from the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-242">Figure&nbsp;12-5</a> shows a dialog
        map for this fairly complex use case. The entry point for this dialog
        map is the transition line that begins with a solid black circle, “ask
        to place a request.” The user would enter this portion of the
        application’s user interface from some other part of the UI along that
        line. Exit points for the dialog map to return to some other portion
        of the UI are the transition lines ending with a solid black circle
        inside another circle, “cancel entire request” and “OK; exit request
        function.”</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-242" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2980" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000051.jpeg" alt="A partial dialog map for the “Request a Chemical” use case from the Chemical Tracking System." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;12-5.&nbsp;A partial dialog map for the “Request a Chemical” use case

        trace through it one line and one box at a time, it’s not difficult to
        understand. The user initiates this use case by asking to place a
        request for a chemical from some menu in the Chemical Tracking System.
        In the dialog map, this action brings the user to the box called
        “Current Request List,” along the arrow in the upper-left part of the
        dialog map. That box represents the main workspace for this use case,
        a list of the chemicals in the user’s current request. The arrows
        leaving that box on the dialog map show all the navigation options&mdash;and
        hence functionality&mdash;available to the user in that context:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Cancel the entire request.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Submit the request if it contains at least one
            chemical.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Add a new chemical to the request list.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Delete a chemical from the list.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">The last operation, deleting a chemical, doesn’t involve another
        dialog element; it simply refreshes the current request list display
        after the user makes the change.</p><p class="calibre3">As you trace through this dialog map, you’ll see elements that
        reflect the rest of the “Request a Chemical” use case:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">One flow path for requesting a chemical from a vendor</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Another path for fulfillment from the chemical
            stockroom</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">An optional path to view the history of a container in the
            chemical stockroom</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">An error message display to handle entry of an invalid
            chemical identifier or other error conditions that could
            arise</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Some of the transitions on the dialog map allow the user to back
        out of operations. Users get annoyed if they are forced to complete a
        task even though they change their minds partway through it. The
        dialog map lets you maximize usability by designing in those back-out
        and cancel options at strategic points.</p><p class="calibre3">A user who reviews this dialog map might spot a missing
        requirement. For example, a cautious user might want to confirm the
        operation that leads to canceling an entire request to avoid
        inadvertently losing data. It costs less to add this new function at
        the analysis stage than to build it into a completed product. Because
        the dialog map represents just the conceptual view of the possible
        elements involved in the interaction between the user and the system,
        don’t try to pin down all the user interface design details at the
        requirements stage. Instead, use these models to help the project
        stakeholders reach a common understanding of the system’s intended
        functionality.</p></div><div class="book" title="Decision tables and decision trees"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2981">Decision tables and decision trees</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-982" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-986" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1519" class="calibre"></a>A software system is often governed by complex logic,

        a car’s cruise control system and the car is currently cruising, the
        system increases the car’s speed, but if the car isn’t cruising, the
        input is ignored. Developers need functional requirements that
        describe what the system should do under all possible combinations of
        conditions. However, it’s easy to overlook a condition, which results
        in a missing requirement. These gaps are hard to spot by reviewing a

        for discovering the functionality that developers must implement
        (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>). This is particularly true for real-time
        systems. Consider a complex highway intersection with numerous traffic
        lights and pedestrian walk signals. There aren’t many use cases for a
        system like this. A driver might want to proceed through the light or
        to turn left or right. A pedestrian wants to cross the road. Perhaps
        an emergency vehicle wants to be able to turn the traffic signals
        green in its direction so it can speed its way to people who need
        help. Law enforcement might have cameras at the intersection to
        photograph the license plates of red-light violators. This information
        alone isn’t enough for developers to build the correct
        functionality.</p><p class="calibre3">Another way to approach user requirements is to identify the
        external events to which the system must respond. An
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">event</em></span> is some change or activity that takes place
        in the user’s environment that stimulates a response from the software
        system (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-245">[ref250]</a>). An <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">event-response

        an <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">event list</em></span>) itemizes all such events and the
        behavior the system is expected to exhibit in reaction to each event.
        There are three classes of system events, as shown in <a class="xref" title="Figure 12-8. Systems respond to business, signal, and temporal events." href="#calibre_link-246">Figure&nbsp;12-8</a>:</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-246" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2985" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000054.jpeg" alt="Systems respond to business, signal, and temporal events." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;12-8.&nbsp;Systems respond to business, signal, and temporal

              receives a control signal, data reading, or interrupt from an
              external hardware device or another software system, such as
              when a switch closes, a voltage changes, another application
              requests a service, or a user swipes his finger on a tablet’s

              clock reaches a specified time (say, to launch an automatic data
              export operation at midnight) or when a preset duration has
              passed since a previous event (as in a system that logs the

        control systems. To identify events, consider all the states
        associated with the object you are analyzing, and identify any events
        that might transition the object into those states. Review context
        diagrams for any external entities that might initiate an action
        (trigger an event) or require an automatic response (need a temporal
        event triggered). <a class="xref" title="Table 12-3. Partial event-response table for an automobile windshield-wiper system" href="#calibre_link-247">Table&nbsp;12-3</a> contains a
        sample event-response table that partially describes the behavior of
        an automobile’s windshield wipers. Other than event 6, which is a
        temporal event, these are all signal events. Note that the expected
        response depends not only on the event but also on the state of the
        system at the time the event takes place. For instance, events 4 and 5
        in <a class="xref" title="Table 12-3. Partial event-response table for an automobile windshield-wiper system" href="#calibre_link-247">Table&nbsp;12-3</a> result
        in slightly different behaviors depending on whether the wipers were
        on at the time the user set the wiper control to the intermittent
        setting. A response could simply alter some internal system
        information or it could result in an externally visible result. Other
        information you might want to add to an event-response table

        scoping technique (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>). An event-response table
        that defines every possible combination of event, state, and response,
        including exception conditions, can serve as part of the functional
        requirements for that portion of the system. You might model the
        event-response table in a decision table to ensure that all possible
        combinations of events and system states are analyzed. However, the BA
        must supply additional functional and nonfunctional requirements. How
        many cycles per minute does the wiper perform on the slow and fast
        wipe settings? Is the intermittent setting continuously variable, or
        does it have discrete settings? What are the minimum and maximum delay
        times between intermittent wipes? If you omit this sort of
        information, the developer has to track it down or make the decisions
        himself. Remember, the goal is to specify the requirements precisely
        enough that a developer knows what to build and a tester can determine
        if it was built correctly.</p><p class="calibre3">Notice that the events listed in <a class="xref" title="Table 12-3. Partial event-response table for an automobile windshield-wiper system" href="#calibre_link-247">Table&nbsp;12-3</a> describe the

        about how the windshield wiper controls look or how the user
        manipulates them. The designer could satisfy these requirements with
        anything from traditional stalk-mounted wiper controls to recognition
        of spoken commands: “wipers on,” “wipers faster,” “wipe once.” Writing
        requirements at the essential level like this avoids imposing
        unnecessary design constraints. However, record any known design
        constraints to guide the designer’s thinking.</p></div><div class="book" title="A few words about UML diagrams"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2987">A few words about UML diagrams</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-553" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-576" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-820" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1504" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1558" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2191" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2362" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2365" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2408" class="calibre"></a>Many projects use object-oriented analysis, design, and

        individual instances derived from a generic template called a
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">class</em></span>. Class descriptions encompass both
        attributes (data) and the operations that can be performed on the
        attributes. A <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">class diagram</em></span> is a graphical way to
        depict the classes identified during object-oriented analysis and the

        unique requirements development approaches. This is because
        requirements development focuses on what the users need to do with the
        system and the functionality it must contain, not with how it will be
        constructed. Users don’t care about objects or classes. However, if
        you know that you’re going to build the system using object-oriented
        techniques, it can be helpful to begin identifying classes and their
        attributes and behaviors during requirements analysis. This
        facilitates the transition from analysis to design, because the
        designer maps the problem-domain objects to the system’s objects and
        further details each class’s attributes and operations.</p><p class="calibre3">The standard object-oriented modeling language is the Unified

        requirements from a variety of perspectives, no matter what the
        project’s development approach is. The choice of models used across
        different development approaches will likely be the same. The
        difference in how traditional and agile projects perform modeling is
        related to when the models are created and the level of detail in
        them.</p><p class="calibre3">For example, you might draft a level 0 DFD early in an agile
        project. Then, during an iteration, you could draw more detailed DFDs
        to cover the scope of that iteration only. Also, you might create
        models in a less persistent or less perfected format on an agile
        project than on a traditional project. You might sketch an analysis
        model on a whiteboard and photograph it, but not store it with formal
        requirements documentation or in a modeling tool. As user stories are
        implemented, models can be updated (perhaps using color to indicate
        completeness), which shows what is being implemented in an iteration
        and reveals additional user stories that are needed to complete the
        picture.</p><p class="calibre3">The key point in using analysis models on agile projects&mdash;or
        really, on any project&mdash;is to focus on creating only the models you
        need, only when you need them, and only to the level of detail you
        need to make sure project stakeholders adequately understand the
        requirements. User stories won’t always be sufficient to capture the
        level of detail and precision necessary for an agile project (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-93">[ref157]</a>). Do not rule out the use of any models just
        because you are working on an agile project.</p></div><div class="book" title="A final reminder"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2989">A final reminder</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Each of the modeling techniques described in this chapter has

        sufficient to represent all aspects of the system. Also, they overlap
        in the views they provide, so you won’t need to create every kind of
        diagram for your project. For instance, if you create an ERD and a
        data dictionary, you probably won’t need to create a class diagram.
        Keep in mind that you draw analysis models to provide a level of
        understanding and communication that goes beyond what textual
        requirements or any other single view of the requirements can
        provide.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-2990" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Next steps</div><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Practice using the modeling techniques described in this

      lengths, and validation criteria for the same data item. In fact, I used
      different lengths for the variable that held the user’s name in two
      programs I wrote myself. Bad things can happen when you interconvert
      data of different lengths. You can overwrite other data, pick up stray
      pad characters at the end, have unterminated character strings, and even
      overwrite program code, eventually causing a crash. Bad
      things.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Our project suffered from the lack of a data
      dictionary&mdash;a shared repository that defines the meaning, composition,
      data type, length, format, and allowed values for data elements used in
      the application. As soon as the team began defining and managing our
      data in a more disciplined way, all of those problems
      disappeared.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">Computer systems manipulate data in ways that provide value to
      customers. Although they were not shown explicitly in the three-level
      requirements model in <a class="xref" title="Figure 1-1. Relationships among several types of requirements information. Solid arrows mean “are stored in”; dotted arrows mean “are the origin of” or “influence.”" href="#calibre_link-29">Figure&nbsp;1-1</a> in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 1. The essential software requirement" href="#calibre_link-21">Chapter&nbsp;1</a> data requirements
      pervade the three levels. Anywhere there are functions, there is data.
      Whether the data represents pixels in a video game, packets in a cell
      phone call, your company’s quarterly sales figures, your bank account
      activity, or anything else, software functionality is specified to
      create, modify, display, delete, process, and use data. The business
      analyst should begin collecting data definitions as they pop up during
      requirements elicitation.</p><p class="calibre3">A good place to start is with the input and output flows on the
      system’s context diagram. These flows represent major data elements at a
      high level of abstraction, which the BA can refine into details as
      elicitation progresses. Nouns that users mention during requirements
      elicitation often indicate important data entities: chemical request,
      requester, chemical, status, usage report. This chapter describes ways
      to explore and represent the data that’s important to your application’s
      users, along with ways to specify any reports or dashboards your
      application needs to generate.</p><div class="book" title="Modeling data relationships"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2992">Modeling data relationships</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Just as the data flow diagram described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 12. A picture is worth 1024 words" href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter&nbsp;12</a> illustrates the processes
        that take place in a system, a data model depicts the system’s data
        relationships. A data model provides the high-level view of the
        system’s data; the data dictionary provides the detailed view.</p><p class="calibre3">A commonly used data model is the <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">entity-relationship
        diagram</em></span> or ERD (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-123">[ref200]</a>). If your ERD
        represents logical groups of information from the problem domain and
        their interconnections, you’re using the ERD as a requirements
        analysis tool. An analysis ERD helps you understand and communicate
        the data components of the business or the system, without implying
        that the product will necessarily even include a database. When you
        create an ERD during design, you’re defining the logical or physical
        (implementation) structure of the system’s database. That
        implementation view extends or completes the understanding of the
        system begun during analysis and optimizes its realization in, say, a
        relational database environment.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-818" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1144" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Entities</em></span> could represent physical
        items (including people) or aggregations of data that are important to
        the business you’re analyzing or to the system you intend to build.
        Entities are named as singular nouns and are shown in rectangles in an
        ERD. <a class="xref" title="Figure 13-1. Partial entity-relationship diagram for the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-250">Figure&nbsp;13-1</a>
        illustrates a portion of the entity-relationship diagram for the
        Chemical Tracking System, using the Peter Chen notation, one of
        several common ERD modeling notations. Notice that the entities named
        Chemical Request, Vendor Catalog, and Chemical Stockroom Inventory
        appeared as data stores in the data flow diagram in <a class="xref" title="Figure 21-1. When you are replacing an existing system, some requirements will be implemented unchanged, some will be modified, some will be discarded, and some new requirements might be added." href="#calibre_link-251">Figure&nbsp;21-1</a> in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 12. A picture is worth 1024 words" href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter&nbsp;12</a>. Other entities represent
        actors who interact with the system (Requester), physical items that
        are part of the business operations (Chemical Container), and blocks
        of data that weren’t shown in the level 0 DFD but that would appear on
        a lower-level DFD (Container History, Chemical). During physical
        database design of a relational database, entities normally become
        tables.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-250" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2993" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000055.jpeg" alt="Partial entity-relationship diagram for the Chemical Tracking System." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;13-1.&nbsp;Partial entity-relationship diagram for the Chemical Tracking
          System.</div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-773" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1473" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1901" class="calibre"></a>Each entity is described by one or more
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">attributes</em></span>; individual instances of an entity
        will have different attribute values. For example, the attributes for
        each chemical include a unique chemical identifier, its chemical name,
        and a graphical representation of its chemical structure. The data
        dictionary contains the precise definitions of those attributes, which
        helps ensure that entities in the ERD and their corresponding data
        stores in the DFD are defined identically.</p><p class="calibre3">The diamonds in the ERD represent
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">relationships</em></span>, which identify the logical
        linkages between pairs of entities. Relationships are named in a way
        that describes the nature of the connection. For example, the
        relationship between the Chemical Request and the Requester is a
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">placing</em></span> relationship. You can read the
        relationship as either “a Chemical Request is placed by a Requester”
        (left-to-right, passive voice) or as “a Requester places a Chemical
        Request” (right-to-left, active voice). Some conventions would have
        you label the relationship diamond “is placed by,” which makes sense
        only if you read the diagram from left to right. If you happened to
        redraw the diagram such that relative positions of Requester and
        Chemical Request were reversed, then the “is placed by” relationship
        name would be incorrect when read left to right: “a Requester is
        placed by a Chemical Request” is wrong. It’s better to name the
        relationship “placing” and then just restate “placing” in whichever
        way is grammatically logical&mdash;“places” or “is placed by”&mdash;when you read
        the statement.</p><p class="calibre3">When you ask customers to review an ERD, ask them to check
        whether the relationships shown are all correct and appropriate. Also
        ask them to identify any missing entities or any possible
        relationships between entities that the model doesn’t show.</p><p class="calibre3">The <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">cardinality</em></span>, or multiplicity, of each
        relationship is shown with a number or letter on the lines that
        connect entities and relationships. Different ERD notations use
        different conventions to represent cardinality; the example in <a class="xref" title="Figure 13-1. Partial entity-relationship diagram for the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-250">Figure&nbsp;13-1</a> illustrates one
        common approach. Because each Requester can place multiple requests,
        there’s a one-to-many relationship between Requester and Chemical
        Request. This cardinality is shown with a <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">1</em></span> on
        the line connecting Requester and the <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">placing</em></span>
        relationship and an <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">M</em></span> (for many) on the line
        connecting Chemical Request and the <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">placing</em></span>
        relationship. Other possible cardinalities are one-to-one (every
        Chemical Container is tracked by a single Container History) and
        many-to-many (every Vendor Catalog lists many Chemicals, and some
        Chemicals are listed in multiple Vendor Catalogs). If you know that a
        more precise cardinality exists than simply <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">many</em></span>
        (one person has exactly two biological parents), you can show the
        specific number or range of numbers instead of the generic
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">M</em></span>.</p><p class="calibre3">Alternative ERD notations use different symbols on the lines
        connecting entities and relationships to indicate cardinality. In the
        James Martin notation illustrated in <a class="xref" title="Figure 13-2. One alternative notation for an entity-relationship diagram." href="#calibre_link-252">Figure&nbsp;13-2</a>, the entities
        still appear as rectangles, but the relationship between them is
        labeled on the line that connects the entities. The vertical line next
        to Chemical Stockroom Inventory indicates a cardinality of 1, and the
        crow’s foot symbol next to Chemical Container indicates a cardinality
        of many. The circle next to the crow’s foot means that the Chemical
        Stockroom Inventory stores zero or more Chemical Containers.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-252" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2994" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000056.gif" alt="One alternative notation for an entity-relationship diagram." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;13-2.&nbsp;One alternative notation for an entity-relationship

        the various ERD notations. Teams that are applying object-oriented
        development methods will draw UML class diagrams, which show the data
        attributes for individual classes (which correspond to entities in the
        ERD), the logical links between classes, and the cardinalities of
        those links. <a class="xref" title="Figure 13-3. Portion of a UML class diagram for the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-253">Figure&nbsp;13-3</a> illustrates a
        fragment of a class diagram for the Chemical Tracking System. It shows
        the one-to-many relationship between a Requester and a Chemical
        Request, each of which is a “class” shown in a rectangle. The “1..*
        notation means “one or more;” several other cardinality (or
        multiplicity) notations also can be used in class diagrams (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-237">[ref006]</a>). Note that the class diagram also lists the
        attributes associated with each class in the middle section of the
        rectangle. <a class="xref" title="Figure 13-3. Portion of a UML class diagram for the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-253">Figure&nbsp;13-3</a>
        shows just a simplified version of the class diagram notation. When
        class diagrams are used for object-oriented analysis or design, the
        bottommost section of a class rectangle (empty in this example)
        normally shows the operations, or behaviors, that an object of the
        class can perform. For data modeling, though, that third section of
        the class rectangle is left empty.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-253" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2995" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000057.jpeg" alt="Portion of a UML class diagram for the Chemical Tracking System." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;13-3.&nbsp;Portion of a UML class diagram for the Chemical Tracking
          System.</div></div><p class="calibre3">It’s not important which notation you select for drawing a data
        model. What <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">is</em></span> important is that everyone
        involved with the project (and ideally, everyone in the organization)
        who creates such models follows the same notation conventions, and
        that everyone who has to use or review the models knows how to
        interpret them.</p><p class="calibre3">Of course, the system must also contain the functionality that
        does something useful with the data. The relationships between
        entities often reveal such functionality. <a class="xref" title="Figure 13-1. Partial entity-relationship diagram for the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-250">Figure&nbsp;13-1</a> showed that there
        is a “tracking” relationship between the entities Chemical Container
        and Container History. Therefore, you’ll need some
        functionality&mdash;perhaps captured in the form of a use case, a user
        story, or a process flow&mdash;to give the user access to the history for a
        given chemical container. As you analyze your project requirements
        with the help of the data models, you might even discover unneeded
        data that came up in the discussion but that isn’t used
        anywhere.</p></div><div class="book" title="The data dictionary"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-2996">The data dictionary</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">A <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">data dictionary</em></span> is a collection of
        detailed information about the data entities used in an application.
        Collecting the information about composition, data types, allowed
        values, and the like into a shared resource identifies the data
        validation criteria, helps developers write programs correctly, and
        minimizes integration problems. The data dictionary complements the
        project glossary, which defines application domain or business terms,
        abbreviations, and acronyms. We recommend keeping the data dictionary
        and the glossary separate.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-867" class="calibre"></a>During requirements analysis, the information in the
        data dictionary represents data elements and structures of the
        application domain (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-42">[ref013]</a>). This information feeds
        into design in the form of database schemas, tables, and attributes,
        which ultimately lead to variable names in programs. The time you
        invest in creating a data dictionary will be more than repaid by
        avoiding the mistakes that can result when project participants have
        different understandings of the data. If you keep the data dictionary
        current, it will remain a valuable tool throughout the system’s
        operational life and beyond. If you don’t, it might falsely suggest
        out-of-date information, and team members will no longer trust it.
        Maintaining a data dictionary is a serious investment in quality. Data
        definitions often are reusable across applications, particularly
        within a product line. Using consistent data definitions across the
        enterprise reduces integration and interface errors. When possible,
        refer to existing standard data definitions from a repository of
        enterprise knowledge, using a smaller, project-specific set to close
        the gaps.</p><p class="calibre3">As opposed to sprinkling data definitions throughout the project
        documentation, a separate data dictionary makes it easy to find the
        information you need. It also helps avoid redundancies and
        inconsistencies. I once reviewed some use case specifications that
        identified the data elements that made up certain data structures.
        Unfortunately, these compositions weren’t the same in all the places
        where they appeared. Such inconsistency forces a developer or tester
        to track down which&mdash;if any&mdash;of the definitions is correct. Maintaining
        the integrity of the replicated data structures as they evolve is also
        difficult. Compiling or consolidating such information so that there
        is only one instance of each definition that is readily accessible by
        all stakeholders solves these problems.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 13-4. Partial data dictionary for the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-254">Figure&nbsp;13-4</a>

        Containers, Quantity, Quantity Units, Request ID, and Requester Name.
        You can use other columns in the data dictionary to describe each
        primitive’s data type, length, numerical range, list of allowed values
        (as with Quantity Units), and other pertinent attributes.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Structure</strong></span> A data structure
        (or a record) is composed of multiple data elements. Data structures
        shown in <a class="xref" title="Figure 13-4. Partial data dictionary for the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-254">Figure&nbsp;13-4</a>
        are Chemical Request, Delivery Location, Requested Chemical, and
        Requester. The “Composition or Data Type” column in the data
        dictionary is a place to list the elements that make up the structure,
        separating the elements with plus (+) signs. Structures also can
        incorporate other structures: the Requester structure includes the
        Delivery Location structure. Data elements that appear in a structure
        must also have definitions in the data dictionary.</p><p class="calibre3">If an element in a data structure is optional (a value doesn’t
        have to be supplied by the user or the system), enclose it in
        parentheses. In the Requested Chemical structure, the Vendor data
        element is optional because the person submitting the request might
        not know or care which vendor supplies the chemical.</p><p class="calibre3">Hyperlinks are useful in such a data dictionary layout (although
        storing the information in a tool that permits defining such links is
        even better). As an illustration, the data item called Quantity in the
        Requested Chemical data structure in <a class="xref" title="Figure 13-4. Partial data dictionary for the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-254">Figure&nbsp;13-4</a> is shown as a
        hyperlink. The reader could click on that link and jump to the
        definition of Quantity elsewhere in the data dictionary. Navigation
        links are very helpful in an extensive data dictionary that could span
        many pages, or even multiple documents if a project’s data dictionary
        incorporates some definitions from an enterprise-wide data dictionary.
        It’s a good idea to include hyperlinks for all items found in the
        “Composition or Data Type” column that are defined in the data
        dictionary.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-610" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-912" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-944" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-966" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1145" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1904" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Repeating group</strong></span> If
        multiple instances of a particular data element can appear in a
        structure, enclose that item in curly braces. Show the allowed number
        of possible repeats in the form minimum:maximum in front of the
        opening curly brace. As an example, Requested Chemical in the Chemical
        Request structure is a repeating group that appears as
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">1:10{Requested Chemical}</em></span>. This shows that a
        chemical request must contain at least one chemical but may not
        contain more than 10 chemicals. If the maximum number of instances in
        a repeating field is unlimited, use “n” to indicate this. For example,
        “3:n{something}” means that the data structure being defined must
        contain at least three instances of the “something” and there is no
        upper limit on the number of instances of that “something.”</p><p class="calibre3">Precisely defining data elements is harder than it might appear.
        Consider a data type as simple as <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">alphabetic
        characters</em></span>, as is indicated for the Requester Name entry in
        <a class="xref" title="Figure 13-4. Partial data dictionary for the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-254">Figure&nbsp;13-4</a>. Is a name
        case-sensitive, such that “Karl” is different from “karl”? Should the
        system convert text to all uppercase or all lowercase, retain the case
        in a looked-up or user-entered value, or reject an input that doesn’t
        match the expected case? Can any characters other than the 26 letters
        in the English alphabet be used, such as blanks, hyphens, periods, or
        apostrophes, all of which might appear in names? Is only the English
        alphabet permitted, or can alphabets with diacritical marks&mdash;tilde (~),
        umlaut (¨), accent (´), grave (`), cedilla (¸)&mdash;be used? Such precise
        definitions are essential for the developer to know exactly how to
        validate entered data. The formats to be used for displaying data
        elements introduce yet another level of variability. There are many
        ways to show timestamps and dates, for example, with different
        conventions used in different countries. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-211">[ref253]</a>

          reporting requirements.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Consider other variations</strong></span>
          When a user requests a specific report, the BA could suggest
          variations on that theme to see if altering or augmenting the report
          would add business value. One variation is simply sequencing the
          data differently, such as providing order-by capability on data
          elements beyond those the user initially requested. Consider
          providing the user with tools to specify the column sequence.
          Another type of variation is to summarize or drill down. A
          summarized report aggregates detailed results into a more concise,
          higher-level view. “Drill down” means to produce a report that
          displays the supporting details that fed into the summary
          data.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Find the data</strong></span> Ensure that
          the data necessary to populate the report is available to the
          system. Users think in terms of generating the outputs they want,
          which implies certain inputs and sources that will make the
          necessary data available. This analysis might reveal previously
          unknown requirements to access or generate the needed data. Identify
          any business rules that will be applied to compute the output
          data.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Anticipate growth</strong></span> Users
          might request particular reports based on their initial conceptions
          of how much data or how many parameters might be involved. As
          systems grow over time, an initial report layout that worked well
          with small quantities of data might prove intractable. For instance,
          a columnar layout for a certain number of company divisions would
          fit nicely on one page. But doubling the number of company divisions
          might lead to awkward page breaks or the need to scroll a displayed
          report horizontally. You might need to change the layout from
          portrait to landscape mode or to transpose the information shown
          from columnar layout to rows.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Look for similarities</strong></span>
          Multiple users&mdash;or even the same user&mdash;might request similar, but not
          identical, reports. Look for opportunities to merge these variations
          into a single report that provides flexibility to meet diverse needs
          without requiring redundant development and maintenance effort.
          Sometimes the variations can be handled with parameters to provide
          the necessary user flexibility.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1807" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2263" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Distinguish static and dynamic
          reports</strong></span> Static reports print out or display data as of a
          point in time. Dynamic reports provide an interactive, real-time
          view of data. As underlying data changes, the system updates the
          report display automatically. My accounting software has this
          feature. If I’m looking at an expense report and then enter a new
          check I recently wrote, the displayed expense report updates
          immediately. Indicate which type of report you are requesting and
          tailor the requirements accordingly.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Prototype reports</strong></span> It’s
          often valuable to create a mock-up of the report that illustrates a
          possible approach to stimulate user feedback, or to use a similar
          existing report to illustrate the desired layout. Generating such a
          prototype while discussing requirements can lead the elicitation
          participants to impose design constraints, which might or might not
          be desirable. Other times, the developer will create a sample report
          layout during design and solicit customer feedback. Use plausible
          data in the mock-up to make the prototype experience realistic for
          the users who evaluate it.</p></div><div class="book" title="A report specification template"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3001">A report specification template</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 13-6. A report specification template." href="#calibre_link-258">Figure&nbsp;13-6</a>

            helpful for this discussion. Following are some additional topics
            you might want to explore:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist3"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3 pcalibre">If the displayed data is dynamic, how frequently must
                the data be refreshed or augmented, and in what way? For
                instance, does the current data scroll to the left as new
                information is added to the right end of a fixed-width
                window?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3 pcalibre">What parameters should the user be able to change to
                customize a display, such as a date range?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3 pcalibre">Does the user want any conditional formatting to have
                sections of a display change based upon the data? This is
                helpful when you are creating progress or status reports: use
                green if the data meets the criteria for “good,” yellow to
                indicate “caution,” and red for “Whoa, this is messed up!”
                Remember, when using colors in a display, also use patterns to
                accommodate viewers who have difficulty distinguishing colors
                and those who print and distribute the display in
                monochrome.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3 pcalibre">Which displays will need horizontal or vertical
                scrollbars?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3 pcalibre">Should the user be able to enlarge any display in the
                dashboard to see more detail? Should she be able to minimize
                or close displays to free up screen space? In what ways do the
                user’s customizations need to persist across usage
                sessions?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3 pcalibre">Will the user want to alter the form of any of the
                displays, perhaps to toggle between a tabular view and a
                graphical view?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3 pcalibre">Will the user want to drill down in any of the displays
                to see a more detailed report or the underlying data?</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Prototyping a dashboard is an excellent way to work with
        stakeholders to ensure that the layout and presentation styles used
        will meet their needs. You can sketch out possible display components
        on sticky notes and have the stakeholders move them around until they
        find a layout they like. Iteration is a key both to refining the
        requirements and to exploring design alternatives.</p><p class="calibre3">As usual with requirements specification, the amount of detail
        to provide when specifying reports or dashboards depends on who makes
        decisions about their appearance and when those decisions are made.
        The more of these details you’re willing to delegate to the designer,
        the less information you need to supply in requirements. And, as
        always, close collaboration among the BA, user representatives, and
        developers will help ensure that everyone is happy with the
        outcome.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3003" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Next steps</div><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Take a moderately complex data object from your

I’m presenting a
      class in the new training room today, but the heating system is terribly
      loud. I’m practically shouting over the fan and I’m getting hoarse.
      You’re the maintenance supervisor. Why is this system so loud? Is it
      broken?”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“It’s working normally,” Sam replied. “The heating
      system in that room meets the requirements the engineers gave me. It
      circulates the right amount of air per minute, it controls the
      temperature to within half a degree from 60 to 85 degrees, and it has
      all the requested profile programming capabilities. Nobody said anything
      about noise, so I bought the cheapest system that satisfied the
      requirements.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Clarice said, “The temperature control is fine. But this
      is a training room! The students can hardly hear me. We’re going to have
      to install a PA system or get a quieter heating system. What do you
      suggest?”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Sam wasn’t much help. “Clarice, the system meets all the
      requirements I was given,” he repeated. “If I’d known that noise levels
      were so important, I could have bought a different unit, but now it
      would be really expensive to replace it. Maybe you can use some throat
      lozenges so you don’t lose your voice.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">There’s more to software success than just delivering the right
      functionality. Users also have expectations, often unstated, about
      <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">how well</em></span> the product will work. Such expectations
      include how easy it is to use, how quickly it executes, how rarely it
      fails, how it handles unexpected conditions&mdash;and perhaps, how loud it is.
      Such characteristics, collectively known as <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">quality
      attributes, quality factors, quality requirements, quality of service
      requirements</em></span>, or the “&ndash;<span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">ilities</em></span>,”
      constitute a major portion of the system’s nonfunctional requirements.
      In fact, to many people, quality attributes are synonymous with
      nonfunctional requirements, but that’s an oversimplification. Two other
      classes of nonfunctional requirements are constraints (discussed at the
      end of this chapter) and external interface requirements (discussed in
      <a class="xref" title="Chapter 10. Documenting the requirements" href="#calibre_link-38">Chapter&nbsp;10</a>). See the sidebar “If
      they’re nonfunctional, then what are they?” in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 1. The essential software requirement" href="#calibre_link-21">Chapter&nbsp;1</a> for more about the term
      “nonfunctional requirements.”</p><p class="calibre3">People sometimes get hung up on debating whether a particular need
      is a functional or a nonfunctional requirement. The categorization
      matters less than making sure you identify the requirement. This chapter
      will help you detect and specify nonfunctional requirements you might
      not have found otherwise.</p><p class="calibre3">Quality attributes can distinguish a product that merely does what
      it’s supposed to from one that delights its users. Excellent products
      reflect an optimum balance of competing quality characteristics. If you
      don’t explore the customers’ quality expectations during elicitation,
      you’re just lucky if the product satisfies them. Disappointed users and
      frustrated developers are the more typical outcome.</p><p class="calibre3">Quality attributes serve as the origin of many functional
      requirements. They also drive significant architectural and design
      decisions. It’s far more costly to re-architect a completed system to
      achieve essential quality goals than to design for them at the outset.
      Consider the many security updates that vendors of operating systems and
      commonly used applications issue periodically. Some additional work on
      security at development time might avoid a lot of cost and user
      inconvenience.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3005" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">You can’t make me</div><p class="calibre3">Quality attributes can make or break the success of your
        product. One large company spent millions of dollars to replace a
        green-screen call center application with a fancy Windows-based
        version. After all that investment, the call center representatives
        refused to adopt the new system because it was too hard to navigate.
        These power users lost all of the keyboard shortcuts that helped them
        use the old system efficiently. Now they had to use a mouse to get
        around in the app, which was slower for them. The corporate leaders
        first tried the hard-line approach: “We’ll just mandate that they have
        to use the new app,” they said. But the call center staff still
        resisted. What are you going to do? These people are taking customer
        orders, so the company isn’t going to literally turn off the old
        system if they won’t use the new one and risk losing all those orders.
        Users hate to have their productivity impaired by a “new and improved”
        system. The development team had to redesign the user interface and
        add the old keyboard shortcuts before the users would accept the new
        software, delaying the release by months.</p></div><div class="book" title="Software quality attributes"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3006">Software quality attributes</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Several dozen product characteristics can be called quality
        attributes, although most project teams need to carefully consider
        only a handful of them. If developers know which of these
        characteristics are most crucial to success, they can select
        appropriate design and construction approaches to achieve the quality
        goals. Quality attributes have been classified according to a wide
        variety of schemes (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-262">[ref057]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-263">[ref113]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-264">[ref122]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-157">[ref170]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-265">[ref123]</a>). Some authors have
        constructed extensive hierarchies that group related attributes into
        several major categories.</p><p class="calibre3">One way to classify quality attributes distinguishes those
        characteristics that are discernible through execution of the software
        (external quality) from those that are not (internal quality) (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-266">[ref012]</a>). External quality factors are primarily important
        to users, whereas internal qualities are more significant to
        development and maintenance staff. Internal quality attributes
        indirectly contribute to customer satisfaction by making the product
        easier to enhance, correct, test, and migrate to new platforms.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1109" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1643" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1683" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1838" class="calibre"></a><a class="xref" title="Table 14-1. Some software quality attributes" href="#calibre_link-267">Table&nbsp;14-1</a>

        trade-offs and conflicts between certain attributes that make it

        is unattainable, you have to determine which attributes from <a class="xref" title="Table 14-1. Some software quality attributes" href="#calibre_link-267">Table&nbsp;14-1</a> are most important to
        your project’s success. Then you can craft specific quality objectives
        in terms of these essential attributes so designers can make

        attributes for success. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-269">[ref031]</a> recommends the
        following practical approach for identifying and specifying the most
        important attributes for your project. He provides a spreadsheet to
        assist with the analysis at <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4"><a class="xref" href="http://www.clarrus.com/resources/articles/software-quality-attributes" target="_top">www.clarrus.com/resources/articles/software-quality-attributes</a></em></span>.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Step 1: Start with a broad
        taxonomy</strong></span></p><p class="calibre3">Begin with a rich set of quality attributes to consider, such as
        those listed in <a class="xref" title="Table 14-1. Some software quality attributes" href="#calibre_link-267">Table&nbsp;14-1</a>.
        This broad starting point reduces the likelihood of overlooking an
        important quality dimension.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Step 2: Reduce the
        list</strong></span></p><p class="calibre3">Engage a cross-section of stakeholders to assess which of the
        attributes are likely to be important to the project. (See <a class="xref" title="Figure 2-2. Potential stakeholders within the project team, within the developing organization, and outside the organization." href="#calibre_link-68">Figure&nbsp;2-2</a> in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 2. Requirements from the customer’s perspective" href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter&nbsp;2</a> for an extensive
        list of possible project stakeholders.) An airport check-in kiosk
        needs to emphasize usability (because most users will encounter it
        infrequently) and security (because it has to handle payments).
        Attributes that don’t apply to your project need not be considered
        further. Record the rationale for deciding that a particular quality
        attribute is either in or out of consideration.</p><p class="calibre3">Recognize, though, that if you don’t specify quality goals, no
        one should be surprised if the product doesn’t exhibit the expected
        characteristics. This is why it’s important to get input from multiple
        stakeholders. In practice, some of the attributes will clearly be in
        scope, some will clearly be out of scope, and only a few will require
        discussion about whether they are worth considering for the
        project.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Step 3: Prioritize the
        attributes</strong></span></p><p class="calibre3">Prioritizing the pertinent attributes sets the focus for future
        elicitation discussions. Pairwise ranking comparisons can work
        efficiently with a small list of items like this. <a class="xref" title="Figure 14-1. Sample quality attribute prioritization for an airport check-in kiosk." href="#calibre_link-270">Figure&nbsp;14-1</a> illustrates how
        to use Brosseau’s spreadsheet to assess the quality attributes for an
        airport check-in kiosk. For each cell at the intersection of two
        attributes, ask yourself, “If I could have only one of these
        attributes, which would I take?” Entering a less-than sign (&lt;) in
        the cell indicates that the attribute in the row is more important; a
        caret symbol (^) points to the attribute at the top of the column as
        being more important. For instance, comparing availability and
        integrity, I conclude that integrity is more important. The passenger
        can always check in with the desk agent if the kiosk isn’t operational
        (albeit, perhaps with a long line of fellow travelers). But if the
        kiosk doesn’t reliably show the correct data, the passenger will be
        very unhappy. So I put a caret in the cell at the intersection of
        availability and integrity, pointing up to integrity as being the more
        important of the two.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-270" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3007" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000060.jpeg" alt="A table displaying eight quality attributes going down               in rows on the left and the same eight going across in columns               at the top. Symbols in each cell of the table point to the left               if the attribute in that row is more important, or to the top if               the attribute in that column is more important. A score is               displayed for each attribute to show which ones are more               important than others." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;14-1.&nbsp;Sample quality attribute prioritization for an airport
          check-in kiosk.</div></div><p class="calibre3">The spreadsheet calculates a relative score for each attribute,
        shown in the second column. In this illustration, security is most
        important (with a score of 7), closely followed by integrity (6) and
        usability (5). Though the other factors are indeed important to
        success&mdash;it’s not good if the kiosk isn’t available for travelers to
        use or if it crashes halfway through the check-in process&mdash;the fact is
        that not all quality attributes can have top priority.</p><p class="calibre3">The prioritization step helps in two ways. First, it lets you
        focus elicitation efforts on those attributes that are most strongly
        aligned with project success. Second, it helps you know how to respond
        when you encounter conflicting quality requirements. In the airport
        check-in kiosk example, elicitation would reveal a desire to achieve
        specific performance goals, as well as some specific security goals.
        These two attributes can clash, because adding security layers can
        slow down transactions. However, because the prioritization exercise
        revealed that security is more important (with a score of 7) than
        performance (with a score of 4), you should bias the resolution of any
        such conflicts in favor of security.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3008" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Don’t neglect stakeholders such as maintenance programmers and
          technical support staff when exploring quality attributes. Their
          quality priorities could be very different from those of other
          users. Quality priorities also can vary from one user class to
          another. If you encounter conflicts, then the approach is doing
          exactly what it was intended to do: expose these conflicts so you
          can work through them early in the development life cycle, where
          conflicts can be resolved with minimal cost and grief.</p></div><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Step 4: Elicit specific expectations for
        each attribute</strong></span></p><p class="calibre3">The comments users make during requirements elicitation supply
        some clues about the quality characteristics they have in mind for the
        product. The trick is to pin down just what the users are thinking
        when they say the software must be user-friendly, fast, reliable, or
        robust. Questions that explore the users’ expectations can lead to
        specific quality requirements that help developers create a delightful
        product.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1105" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1489" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1648" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1661" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1823" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1849" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2026" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2129" class="calibre"></a>Users won’t know how to answer questions such as “What
        are your interoperability requirements?” or “How reliable does the
        software have to be?” The business analyst will need to ask questions
        that guide the users’ thought processes through an exploration of
        interoperability, reliability, and other attributes. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-157">[ref170]</a> provides extensive lists of suggested questions to
        use when eliciting quality requirements; this chapter also presents
        many examples. When planning an elicitation session, a BA should start
        with a list of questions like Miller’s and distill it down to those
        questions that are most pertinent to the project. As an illustration,
        following are a few questions a BA might ask to understand user
        expectations about the performance of a system that manages
        applications for patents that inventors have submitted:</p><div class="book"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1"><p class="calibre3">What would be a reasonable or acceptable response time for
            retrieval of a typical patent application in response to a
            query?</p></li><li class="listitem" value="2"><p class="calibre3">What would users consider an unacceptable response time for
            a typical query?</p></li><li class="listitem" value="3"><p class="calibre3">How many simultaneous users do you expect on average?</p></li><li class="listitem" value="4"><p class="calibre3">What’s the maximum number of simultaneous users that you
            would anticipate?</p></li><li class="listitem" value="5"><p class="calibre3">What times of the day, week, month, or year have much
            heavier usage than usual?</p></li></ol></div><p class="calibre3">Sending a list of questions like these to elicitation
        participants in advance gives them an opportunity to think about or
        research their answers so they don’t have to answer a barrage of
        questions off the tops of their heads. A good final question to ask
        during any such elicitation discussion is, “Is there anything I
        haven’t asked you that we should discuss?”</p><p class="calibre3">Consider asking users what would constitute
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">unacceptable</em></span> performance, security, or
        reliability. That is, specify system properties that would violate the
        user’s quality expectations, such as allowing an unauthorized user to
        delete files (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-271">[ref233]</a>). Defining unacceptable
        characteristics lets you devise tests that try to force the system to
        demonstrate those characteristics. If you can’t force them, you’ve
        probably achieved your quality goals. This approach is particularly
        valuable for safety-critical applications, in which a system that
        violates reliability or safety tolerances poses a risk to life or
        limb.</p><p class="calibre3">Another possible elicitation strategy is to begin with the
        quality goals that stakeholders have for the system under development
        (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-147">[ref003]</a>). A stakeholder’s quality goal can be
        decomposed to reveal both functional and nonfunctional subgoals&mdash;and
        hence requirements&mdash;which become both more specific and easier to
        measure through the decomposition.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Step 5: Specify well-structured quality
        requirements</strong></span></p><p class="calibre3">Simplistic quality requirements such as “The system shall be
        user-friendly” or “The system shall be available 24×7” aren’t useful.
        The former is far too subjective and vague; the latter is rarely
        realistic or necessary. Neither is measurable. Such requirements
        provide little guidance to developers. So the final step is to craft
        specific and verifiable requirements from the information that was
        elicited regarding each quality attribute. When writing quality
        requirements, keep in mind the useful SMART mnemonic&mdash;make them
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant</em></span>, and
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Time-sensitive</em></span>.</p><p class="calibre3">Quality requirements need to be measurable to establish a
        precise agreement on expectations among the BA, the customers, and the
        development team. If it’s not measurable, there is little point in
        specifying it, because you’ll never be able to determine if you’ve
        achieved a desired goal. If a tester can’t test a requirement, it’s
        not good enough. Indicate the scale or units of measure for each
        attribute and the target, minimum, and maximum values. The notation
        called Planguage described later in this chapter helps with this sort
        of precise specification. It might take a few discussions with users
        to pin down clear, measurable criteria for assessing satisfaction of a
        quality requirement.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-636" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1257" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1447" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1468" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1474" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1476" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1825" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1833" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2054" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2055" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2284" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2562" class="calibre"></a><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-206">[ref201]</a> recommend including
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">fit criteria</em></span>&mdash;“a quantification of the requirement
        that demonstrates the standard the product must reach”&mdash;as part of the
        specification of every requirement, both functional and nonfunctional.
        This is excellent advice. Fit criteria describe a measurable way to
        assess whether each requirement has been implemented correctly. They
        help designers select a solution they believe will meet the goal, and
        they help testers evaluate the results.</p><p class="calibre3">Instead of inventing your own way to document unfamiliar
        requirements, look for an existing requirement pattern to follow. A
        pattern provides guidance about how to write a particular type of
        requirement, along with a template you can populate with the specific
        details for your situation. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-211">[ref253]</a> provides
        numerous patterns for specifying quality requirements, including
        performance, availability, flexibility, scalability, security, user
        access, and installability. Following patterns like these will help
        even novice BAs write sound quality requirements.</p></div><div class="book" title="Defining quality requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3009">Defining quality requirements</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">This section describes each of the quality attributes in <a class="xref" title="Table 14-1. Some software quality attributes" href="#calibre_link-267">Table&nbsp;14-1</a> and presents some sample

        well-specified quality attribute requirements. As with all
        requirements, it’s a good idea to record the origin of each quality
        requirement and the rationale behind the stated quality goals if these

          performance, reliability, robustness, safety, security, and
          usability.</p><div class="book" title="Availability"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-3011">Availability</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Availability is a measure of the planned up time during
            which the system’s services are available for use and fully
            operational. Formally, availability equals the ratio of up time to
            the sum of up time and down time. Still more formally,
            availability equals the mean time between failures (MTBF) for the
            system divided by the sum of the MTBF and the mean time to repair
            (MTTR) the system after a failure is encountered. Scheduled
            maintenance periods also affect availability. Availability is
            closely related to reliability and is strongly affected by the
            maintainability subcategory of modifiability.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-904" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1078" class="calibre"></a>Certain tasks are more time-critical than others.
            Users become frustrated&mdash;even irate&mdash;when they need to get essential
            work done and the functionality they need isn’t available. Ask
            users what percentage of up time is really needed or how many
            hours in a given time period the system must be available. Ask
            whether there are any time periods for which availability is
            imperative to meet business or safety objectives. Availability
            requirements are particularly complex and important for websites,
            cloud-based applications, and applications that have users
            distributed throughout many time zones. An availability
            requirement might be stated like the following:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">AVL-1. The system shall be at least 95 percent
              available on weekdays between 6:00 A.M. and midnight Eastern
              Time, and at least 99 percent available on weekdays between 3:00
              P.M. and 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">As with many of the examples presented in this chapter, this
            requirement is somewhat simplified. It doesn’t define the level of
            performance that constitutes being <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">available</em></span>.
            Is the system considered available if only one person can use it
            on the network in a degraded mode? Probably not.</p><p class="calibre3">Availability requirements are sometimes stipulated
            contractually as a service level agreement. Service providers
            might have to pay a penalty if they do not satisfy such
            agreements. Such requirements must precisely define exactly what
            constitutes a system being available (or not) and could include
            statements such as the following:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">AVL-2. Down time that is excluded from the
              calculation of availability consists of maintenance scheduled
              during the hours from 6:00 P.M. Sunday Pacific Time, through
              3:00 A.M. Monday Pacific Time.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3012" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">The cost of quality</div><p class="calibre3">Beware of specifying 100 percent as the expected value of
              a quality attribute such as reliability or availability. It will
              be impossible to achieve and expensive to strive for.
              Life-critical applications such as air traffic control systems
              do have very stringent&mdash;and legitimate&mdash;availability demands. One
              such system had a “five 9s” requirement, meaning that the system
              must be available 99.999 percent of the time. That is, the
              system could be down no more than 5 minutes and 15 seconds per
              year. This one requirement contributed to perhaps 25 percent of
              the system costs. It virtually doubled the hardware costs
              because of the redundancy required, and it introduced very
              complex architectural elements to handle a hot backup and
              failover strategy for the system.</p></div><p class="calibre3">When eliciting availability requirements, ask questions to

            appropriate device or platform. Some examples of software
            installation are: downloading apps to a phone or tablet; moving
            software from a PC onto a web server; updating an operating
            system; installing a huge commercial system, such as an enterprise
            resource planning tool; downloading a firmware update into a cable
            TV set-top box; and installing an end-user application onto a PC.
            Installability describes how easy is it to perform these
            operations correctly. Increasing a system’s installability reduces
            the time, cost, user disruption, error frequency, and skill level
            needed for an installation operation. Installability addresses the
            following activities:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Initial installation</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Recovery from an incomplete, incorrect, or user-aborted

            install the system. This depends on a lot of factors, though: how
            experienced the installer is, how fast the destination computer
            is, the medium from which the software is being installed
            (Internet download, local network, CD/DVD), manual steps needed
            during the installation, and so forth. The Testing Standards
            Working Party provides a detailed list of guidelines and
            considerations for installability requirements and installability

            preserving the correctness of data entered into the system.
            Integrity requirements have no tolerance for error: the data is
            either in good shape and protected, or it is not. Data needs to be
            protected against threats such as accidental loss or corruption,
            ostensibly identical data sets that do not match, physical damage
            to storage media, accidental file erasure, or data overwriting by
            users. Intentional attacks that attempt to deliberately corrupt or
            steal data are also a risk. Security sometimes is considered a
            subset of integrity, because some security requirements are
            intended to prevent access to data by unauthorized users.
            Integrity requirements should ensure that the data received from
            other systems matches what is sent and vice versa. Software
            executables themselves are subject to attack, so their integrity
            also must be protected.</p><p class="calibre3">Data integrity also addresses the accuracy and proper
            formatting of the data (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-157">[ref170]</a>). This includes
            concerns such as formatting of fields for dates, restricting
            fields to the correct data type or length, ensuring that data
            elements have valid values, checking for an appropriate entry in
            one field when another field has a certain value, and so on.
            Following are some sample integrity requirements:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">INT-1. After performing a file backup, the

            exchange data and services with other software systems and how
            easily it can integrate with external hardware devices. To assess
            interoperability, you need to know which other applications the
            users will employ in conjunction with your product and what data
            they expect to exchange. Users of the Chemical Tracking System
            were accustomed to drawing chemical structures with several
            commercial tools, so they presented the following interoperability

            requirement and define the information formats that the Chemical
            Tracking System can import. You could also define several
            functional requirements that deal with the import operation.
            Identifying and documenting such requirements is more important

              interoperability requirement but forget to change the same
              information that you also recorded as a functional or external
              interface requirement.</p></div><p class="calibre3">Interoperability requirements might dictate that standard

            for a query to display results. But performance problems can also
            represent serious risks to safety, such as when a real-time
            process control system is overloaded. Stringent performance
            requirements strongly affect software design strategies and
            hardware choices, so define performance goals that are appropriate
            for the operating environment. All users want their applications
            to run instantly, but the real performance requirements will be
            different for a spell-check feature than for a missile’s radar
            guidance system. Satisfying performance requirements can be tricky
            because they depend so much upon external factors such as the
            speed of the computer being used, network connections, and other
            hardware components.</p><p class="calibre3">When documenting performance requirements, also document
            their rationale to guide the developers in making appropriate
            design choices. For instance, stringent database response time
            demands might lead the designers to mirror the database in
            multiple geographical locations. Specify the number of
            transactions per second to be performed, response times, and task
            scheduling relationships for real-time systems. You could also
            specify memory and disk space requirements, concurrent user loads,
            or the maximum number of rows stored in database tables. Users and
            BAs might not know all this information, so plan to collaborate
            with various stakeholders to research the more technical aspects
            of quality requirements. Following are some sample performance

            failure for a specific period of time is known as reliability
            (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-273">[ref175]</a>). Reliability problems can occur
            because of improper inputs, errors in the software code itself,
            components that are not available when needed, and hardware
            failures. Robustness and availability are closely related to
            reliability. Ways to specify and measure software reliability
            include the percentage of operations that are completed correctly,
            the average length of time the system runs before failing (mean
            time between failures, or MTBF), and the maximum acceptable
            probability of a failure during a given time period. Establish
            quantitative reliability requirements based on how severe the
            impact would be if a failure occurred and whether the cost of
            maximizing reliability is justifiable. Systems that require high
            reliability should also be designed for high verifiability to make
            it easier to find defects that could compromise
            reliability.</p><p class="calibre3">My team once wrote some software to control laboratory
            equipment that performed day-long experiments using scarce,
            expensive chemicals. The users required the software component
            that actually ran the experiments to be highly reliable. Other
            system functions, such as logging temperature data periodically,
            were less critical. A reliability requirement for this system
            was</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">REL-1. No more than 5 experimental runs out of

            might force the user to re-launch an application and recover data
            that was saved. This is annoying but not catastrophic. Failures
            that result in lost or corrupted data, such as when an attempted
            database transaction fails to commit properly, are more severe.
            Preventing errors is better than detecting them and attempting to
            recover from them.</p><p class="calibre3">Like many other quality attributes, reliability is a lagging
            indicator: you can’t tell if you’ve achieved it until the system
            has been in operation for awhile. Consider the following
            example:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">REL-2. The mean time between failures of the

            requirement until at least 90 days have passed. However, you can
            tell if the system has <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">failed</em></span> to demonstrate
            sufficient reliability if the card reader component fails more
            than once within a 90-day period.</p><p class="calibre3">Following are some questions to ask user representatives

            designers, and developers take actions that they think will
            achieve the necessary reliability. From a requirements
            perspective, one way to make a system both reliable and robust is
            to specify exception conditions and how they are to be handled.
            Badly handled exceptions can convey an impression of poor
            reliability and usability to users. A website that blanks out the
            information a user had entered in a form when it encounters a
            single bad input value is exasperating. No user would ever specify
            that behavior as being acceptable. Developers can make systems
            more reliable by practicing defensive programming techniques, such
            as testing all input data values for validity and confirming that
            disk write operations were completed successfully.</p></div><div class="book" title="Robustness"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-3019">Robustness</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">A customer once told a company that builds measurement
            devices that its next product should be “built like a tank.” The
            developing company therefore adopted&mdash;slightly tongue-in-cheek&mdash;the
            new quality attribute of “tankness.” Tankness is a colloquial way
            of saying <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">robustness</em></span>. Robustness is the
            degree to which a system continues to function properly when
            confronted with invalid inputs, defects in connected software or
            hardware components, external attack, or unexpected operating
            conditions. Robust software recovers gracefully from problem
            situations and is forgiving of user mistakes. It recovers from
            internal failures without adversely affecting the end-user
            experience. Software errors are handled in a way the user
            perceives as reasonable, not annoying. Other attribute terms
            associated with robustness are <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">fault

            corrected?), <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">survivability</em></span> (can the camera

            operation if it loses power in the middle of an operating system
            update?).</p><p class="calibre3">When eliciting robustness requirements, ask users about
            error conditions the system might encounter and how the system
            should react. Think about ways to detect possible faults that
            could lead to a system failure, report them to the user, and
            recover from them if the failure occurs. Make sure you understand
            when one operation (such as preparing data for transmission) must
            be completed correctly before another can begin (sending the data
            to another computer system). One example of a robustness
            requirement is</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">ROB-1. If the text editor fails before the user

            with functionality to look for the saved data upon startup and
            restore the file contents. You wouldn’t want to stipulate the
            precise mechanism in a robustness requirement, though. Leave those

              thinking that the data had all been spooled to the printer. It
              hadn’t. How would the print spooler recover from my error when I
              woke the computer up? Would the spooler terminate and not print
              the rest of the file, resume printing where it left off, reprint
              the entire job, or what? It reprinted the entire job, although I
              would have preferred that it would just continue printing. I
              wasted some paper, but at least the spooler recovered from my
              user error and kept going.</p></div><p class="calibre3">I once led a project to develop a reusable software
            component called the Graphics Engine, which interpreted data files
            that defined graphical plots and rendered the plots on a
            designated output device. Several applications that needed to
            generate plots invoked the Graphics Engine. Because the developers
            had no control over the data that these applications fed into the
            Graphics Engine, robustness was an essential quality. One of our
            robustness requirements was</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">ROB-2. All plot description parameters shall
              have default values specified, which the Graphics Engine shall
              use if a parameter’s input data is missing or
              invalid.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">With this requirement, the program wouldn’t crash if, for
            example, an application requested an unsupported line style. The
            Graphics Engine would supply the default solid line style and
            continue executing. This would still constitute a product failure
            because the end user didn’t get the desired output. But designing
            for robustness reduced the severity of the failure from a program
            crash to generating an incorrect line style, an example of fault
            tolerance.</p></div><div class="book" title="Safety"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-3021">Safety</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Safety requirements deal with the need to prevent a system

            example. The real requirement is to restrict access to the system
            to authorized users; passwords are merely one way (albeit the most
            common way) to accomplish that objective. Depending on which user
            authentication method is chosen, this security requirement will
            lead to specific functional requirements that implement the

            Analysts and developers shouldn’t talk about “friendly” software
            but rather about software that’s designed for effective and
            unobtrusive usage. Usability measures the effort required to
            prepare input for a system, operate it, and interpret its
            outputs.</p><p class="calibre3">Software usability is a huge topic with a considerable body
            of literature (for example: <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-240">[ref049]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-276">[ref179]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-277">[ref155]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-278">[ref144]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-279">[ref129]</a>). Usability
            encompasses several subdomains beyond the obvious ease of use,
            including ease of learning; memorability; error avoidance,
            handling, and recovery; efficiency of interactions; accessibility;
            and ergonomics. Conflicts can arise between these categories. For
            instance, ease of learning can be at odds with ease of use. The
            actions a designer might take to make it easy for a new or
            infrequent user to employ the system can be irritating impediments
            to a power user who knows exactly what he wants to do and craves
            efficiency. Different features within the same application might
            also have different usability goals. It might be important to be
            able to enter data very efficiently, but also to be able to easily
            figure out how to generate a customized report. <a class="xref" title="Table 14-3. Possible design approaches for ease of learning and ease of use" href="#calibre_link-280">Table&nbsp;14-3</a> illustrates
            some of these usability design approaches; you can see the

              mean that certain users aren’t as happy with the result as

              tried to report a problem using a website’s feedback form. I
              received an error message that “no special characters were
              allowed” but the website did not tell me which characters in my
              text were causing the problem. Obviously, the software knew what
              the bad characters were because it detected them. Showing me a
              generic error message instead of offering precise feedback
              didn’t help me solve the problem. I eventually figured out that
              the software was objecting to the presence of quotation marks in
              my message. It never occurred to me that quotation marks would
              be considered a special character; “special character” is vague
              and ambiguous. To help developers determine how best to satisfy
              a user’s usability expectations, the BA should write specific
              usability requirements, and developers should provide precise
              error feedback whenever possible.</p></div><p class="calibre3">To explore their usability expectations, the business
            analysts on the Chemical Tracking System asked their product
            champions questions such as “How many steps would you be willing
            to go through to request a chemical?” and “How long should it take
            you to complete a chemical request?” These are simple starting
            points toward defining the many characteristics that will make the
            software easy to use. Discussions about usability can lead to
            measurable goals such as the following:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">USE-1. A trained user shall be able to submit a
              request for a chemical from a vendor catalog in an average of
              three minutes, and in a maximum of five minutes, 95 percent of
              the time.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1070" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1644" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1834" class="calibre"></a>Inquire whether the new system must conform to any
            user interface standards or conventions, or whether its user
            interface needs to be consistent with those of other frequently
            used systems. You might state such a usability requirement in the
            following way:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">USE-2. All functions on the File menu shall have
              shortcut keys defined that use the Control key pressed
              simultaneously with one other key. Menu commands that also
              appear in Microsoft Word shall use the same default shortcut
              keys that Word uses.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">Such consistency of usage can help avoid those frustrating
            errors that occur when your fingers perform an action by habit
            that has some different meaning in an application you don’t use
            frequently. Ease-of-learning goals also can be quantified and
            measured, as the following example indicates:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">USE-3. 95 percent of chemists who have never
              used the Chemical Tracking System before shall be able to place
              a request for a chemical correctly with no more than 15 minutes
              of orientation.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">Carefully specifying requirements for the diverse dimensions
            of usability can help designers make the choices that distinguish
            delighted users from those who use an application with frowns on
            their faces or, worse, those who refuse to use it at all.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Internal quality attributes"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3027">Internal quality attributes</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Internal quality attributes are not directly observable during
          execution of the software. They are properties that a developer or
          maintainer perceives while looking at the design or code to modify
          it, reuse it, or move it to another platform. Internal attributes
          can indirectly affect the customer’s perception of the product’s
          quality if it later proves difficult to add new functionality or if
          internal inefficiencies result in performance degradation. The
          following sections describe quality attributes that are particularly
          important to software architects, developers, maintainers, and other
          technical staff.</p><div class="book" title="Efficiency"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-3028">Efficiency</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Efficiency is closely related to the external quality
            attribute of performance. Efficiency is a measure of how well the
            system utilizes processor capacity, disk space, memory, or
            communication bandwidth. If a system consumes too much of the
            available resources, users will encounter degraded
            performance.</p><p class="calibre3">Efficiency&mdash;and hence performance&mdash;is a driving factor in
            systems architecture, influencing how a designer elects to
            distribute computations and functions across system components.
            Efficiency requirements can compromise the achievement of other
            quality attributes. Consider minimum hardware configurations when
            defining efficiency, capacity, and performance goals. To allow
            engineering margins for unanticipated conditions and future growth
            (thereby influencing scalability), you might specify something
            like the following:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">EFF-1. At least 30 percent of the processor

            terms; instead, they will think in terms of response times or
            other observations. The BA must ask the questions that will
            surface user expectations regarding issues such as acceptable
            performance degradation, demand spikes, and anticipated growth.
            Examples of such questions are:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">What is the maximum number of concurrent users now and

            environment to another is a measure of portability. Some
            practitioners include the ability to internationalize and localize
            a product under the heading of portability. The design approaches
            that make software portable are similar to those that make it
            reusable. Portability has become increasingly important as
            applications must run in multiple environments, such as Windows,
            Mac, and Linux; iOS and Android; and PCs, tablets, and phones.
            Data portability requirements are also important.</p><p class="calibre3">Portability goals should identify those portions of the
            product that must be movable to other environments and describe
            those target environments. One product for analyzing chemicals ran
            in two very different environments. One version ran in a
            laboratory where a PhD chemist used the software to control
            several analytical instruments. The second version ran in a
            handheld device to be used in the field, such as at an oil
            pipeline, by someone who had much less technical education. The
            core capabilities of the two versions were largely the same. Such
            a product needs to be designed from the outset to work in both
            kinds of environments with the minimum amount of development work.
            If developers know about the customers’ expectations of
            portability, they can select development approaches that will
            enhance the product’s portability appropriately. Following are
            some sample portability requirements:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-1107" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1113" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1860" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2007" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2030" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">POR-1.

            Reusable software must be modular, well documented, independent of
            a specific application and operating environment, and somewhat
            generic in capability. Numerous project artifacts offer the
            potential for reuse, including requirements, architectures,
            designs, code, tests, business rules, data models, user class
            descriptions, stakeholder profiles, and glossary terms (see <a class="xref" title="Chapter 18. Requirements reuse" href="#calibre_link-85">Chapter&nbsp;18</a>). Making software reusable is
            facilitated by thorough specification of requirements and designs,
            rigorous adherence to coding standards, a maintained regression
            suite of test cases, and a maintained standard library of reusable
            components.</p><p class="calibre3">Reusability goals are difficult to quantify. Specify which
            elements of the new system need to be constructed in a manner that
            facilitates their reuse, or stipulate the reusable components that
            should be created as a spin-off from the project. Following are

            geographic locations, transactions, network traffic, searches, and
            other services without compromising performance or correctness.
            Scalability has both hardware and software implications. Scaling
            up a system could mean acquiring faster computers, adding memory
            or disk space, adding servers, mirroring databases, or increasing
            network capacity. Software approaches might include distributing
            computations onto multiple processors, compressing data,
            optimizing algorithms, and other performance-tuning techniques.
            Scalability is related to modifiability and to robustness, because
            one category of robustness has to do with how the system behaves
            when capacity limits are approached or exceeded. Following are

              following Thanksgiving every November. It has become a
              traditional day for consumers to shop at online sales for the
              holiday season. When this custom took root in the mid-2000s,
              many e-commerce websites weren’t prepared to handle the spikes
              in traffic and transactions from customers shopping for
              bargains. Servers crashed, passwords weren’t recognized, and
              purchases took too long to be completed. Many shoppers abandoned
              the online stores they were trying to access and found someplace
              else to shop, perhaps never to return. Cybercriminals made out,
              well, like bandits, as traffic was diverted to their look-alike
              websites that stole shoppers’ personal information.</p><p class="calibre3">These problems reveal an intertwined mass of unsatisfied

              financial bottom line.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Verifiability"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-3039">Verifiability</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">More narrowly referred to as
            <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">testability</em></span>, verifiability refers to how well
            software components or the integrated product can be evaluated to
            demonstrate whether the system functions as expected. Designing
            for verifiability is critical if the product has complex
            algorithms and logic, or if it contains subtle functionality
            interrelationships. Verifiability is also important if the product
            will be modified often, because it will undergo frequent
            regression testing to determine whether the changes damaged any
            existing functionality. Systems with high verifiability can be
            tested both effectively and efficiently. Designing software for
            verifiability means making it easy to place the software into the
            desired pretest state, to provide the necessary test data, and to
            observe the result of the test. Here are some examples of
            verifiability requirements:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">VER-1. The development environment configuration

            test, and to maintain. The project wasn’t going to be a failure if
            some module had a cyclomatic complexity of 24, but documenting

        defines the units of measurement and <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">meter</em></span>
        describes how to make the measurements. All stakeholders need to have
        the same understanding of what “performance” means. Suppose that a
        user interprets the measurement to be from the time that he presses
        the Enter key until the complete report appears, rather than until the
        beginning of the report display, as stated in the example. The
        developer might claim that the requirement is satisfied, whereas the
        user insists that it is not. Unambiguous quality requirements and
        measurements prevent these sorts of debates.</p><p class="calibre3">One advantage of Planguage is that you can specify several
        target values for the quantity being measured. The
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">goal</em></span> criterion is the minimum acceptable
        achievement level. The requirement isn’t satisfied unless every
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">goal</em></span> condition is completely satisfied, so make
        sure the goals are justifiable in terms of real business needs. An
        alternative way to state the <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">goal</em></span> requirement is
        to define the <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">fail</em></span> (another Planguage keyword)
        condition: “More than 8 seconds on more than 5 percent of all
        reports.” The <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">stretch</em></span> value describes a more
        desirable performance objective, and the <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">wish</em></span>
        value represents the ideal outcome. Consider showing the origin of
        performance goals. The “←” notation following the
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">goal</em></span> criterion shows that it came from the Field
        Office Manager. Any specialized terms in the Planguage statement are
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">defined</em></span> to make them clear to the reader. This
        example provides a definition of something called the Base User
        Platform on which the test is to be conducted.</p><p class="calibre3">Planguage includes many additional keywords to provide
        flexibility and precision in specifying unambiguous quality attribute
        requirements, and even business objectives. Specifying multiple levels
        of achievement yields a far richer statement of a quality requirement
        than a simple black-and-white, yes-or-no construct can. The drawback
        to using Planguage is that the resulting requirements are much bulkier
        than simple quality requirement statements. However, the richness of

        write the quality requirements using the full Planguage formalism,

        Users and developers must decide which attributes are more important
        than others, and they must respect those priorities when they make
        decisions. The technique described earlier in “Step 3: Prioritize the
        attributes” can help with this analysis. <a class="xref" title="Figure 14-2. Positive and negative relationships among selected quality attributes." href="#calibre_link-284">Figure&nbsp;14-2</a> illustrates some
        typical interrelationships among the quality attributes from <a class="xref" title="Table 14-1. Some software quality attributes" href="#calibre_link-267">Table&nbsp;14-1</a>, although you might
        encounter exceptions to these (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-285">[ref038]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-286">[ref089]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-263">[ref113]</a>). A plus sign in a cell
        indicates that increasing the attribute in the corresponding row
        usually has a positive effect on the attribute in the column. For
        example, design approaches that increase a software component’s
        portability also make the software easier to connect to other software
        components, easier to reuse, and easier to test.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-284" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3041" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000061.jpeg" alt="Positive and negative relationships among selected quality attributes." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;14-2.&nbsp;Positive and negative relationships among selected quality
          attributes.</div></div><p class="calibre3">A minus sign in a cell means that increasing the attribute in
        that row generally adversely affects the attribute in the column. An
        empty cell indicates that the attribute in the row has little effect
        on the attribute in the column. Performance and efficiency have a
        negative impact on several other attributes. If you write the
        tightest, fastest code you can, using coding tricks and relying on
        execution side effects, it’s likely to be hard to maintain and
        enhance. It also could be harder to port to other platforms if you’ve
        tuned the code for a specific operating environment. Similarly,
        systems that optimize ease of use or that are designed to be reusable
        and interoperable with other software or hardware components often
        incur a performance penalty. Using the general-purpose Graphics Engine
        component described earlier in the chapter to generate plots resulted
        in poorer performance compared with the old applications that
        incorporated custom graphics code. You have to balance the possible
        performance (or other) reductions against the anticipated benefits of
        your proposed solution to ensure that you’re making sensible
        trade-offs.</p><p class="calibre3">The matrix in <a class="xref" title="Figure 14-2. Positive and negative relationships among selected quality attributes." href="#calibre_link-284">Figure&nbsp;14-2</a> isn’t
        symmetrical because the effect that increasing attribute A has on
        attribute B isn’t necessarily the same as the effect that increasing B
        will have on A. <a class="xref" title="Figure 14-2. Positive and negative relationships among selected quality attributes." href="#calibre_link-284">Figure&nbsp;14-2</a> shows that
        designing the system to increase performance doesn’t necessarily have
        any effect on security. However, increasing security likely will hurt
        performance because the system must go through more layers of user
        authentications, encryption, and malware scanning.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1001" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1285" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1839" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2073" class="calibre"></a>To reach the optimum balance of product characteristics,

        the desired product characteristics. <a class="xref" title="Table 14-5. Translating quality attributes into technical specifications" href="#calibre_link-287">Table&nbsp;14-5</a> indicates the
        likely categories of technical information that different types of

        backup battery power supply (architecture), along with functional
        requirements to indicate when the product is operating on battery
        power, when the battery is getting low, and so forth. This translation

        appreciate the technical implications of quality requirements.
        Therefore, the BA should engage the right stakeholders who have
        knowledge of these implications and learn from those collaborations.
        Consider scalability, which can be profoundly affected by architecture
        and design choices. Scalability requirements might lead the developer
        to retain performance buffers (disk space, CPU consumption, network
        bandwidth) to accommodate potential growth without degrading system
        performance unacceptably. Scalability expectations can affect the
        hardware and operating environment decisions that developers make.
        This is why it’s important to elicit and document scalability
        requirements early on so developers can ensure that the product can
        grow as expected and still exhibit acceptable performance. This is
        also one reason why it’s important to involve developers early in
        requirements elicitation and reviews.</p></div><div class="book" title="Constraints"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3043">Constraints</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-884" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1827" class="calibre"></a>A constraint places restrictions on the design or
        implementation choices available to the developer. Constraints can be
        imposed by external stakeholders, by other systems that interact with
        the one you’re building or maintaining, or by other life cycle
        activities for your system, such as transition and maintenance. Other
        constraints result from existing agreements, management decisions, and
        technical decisions (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-37">[ref124]</a>). Sources of
        constraints include:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Specific technologies, tools, languages, and databases that

        sources and must be respected. Constraints can be imposed
        inadvertently, though. It’s common for users to present “requirements”
        that are actually solution ideas that describe one particular way the
        user envisions meeting a need. The BA must detect when a requirement
        includes a solution idea like this and distinguish the underlying need
        from the constraint that the solution imposes. Perhaps the solution
        the user has in mind is in fact the ideal way to solve the problem, in
        which case the constraint is perfectly legitimate. More often, the
        real need is hidden, and the BA must work with the user to articulate
        the thoughts that led to the presented solution. Asking “why” a few
        times generally will lead to that real requirement.</p><p class="calibre3">Some people say that quality attributes <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">are</em></span>
        constraints. We prefer to think of certain quality requirements as
        being the origin of some design or implementation constraints. As
        <a class="xref" title="Table 14-5. Translating quality attributes into technical specifications" href="#calibre_link-287">Table&nbsp;14-5</a> indicated,
        interoperability and usability requirements are potential sources of
        design constraints. Portability often imposes implementation
        constraints to make sure the application can easily be moved from one
        platform or operating environment to another. For instance, some
        compilers define an <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">integer</em></span> as being 32 bits
        long, and others define it as 64 bits. To satisfy a portability
        requirement, a developer might symbolically define a data type called
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">WORD</em></span> as a 32-bit unsigned integer and use the
        WORD data type instead of the compiler’s default integer data type.
        This ensures that all compilers will treat data items of type WORD in
        the same way, which helps to make the system work predictably in
        different operating environments.</p><p class="calibre3">Following are some examples of constraints. You can see how
        these restrict the options available to the architect, designer, and
        developer.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">CON-1. The user clicks at the top of the project

        perhaps-unstated quality expectation. Ask why each constraint is
        imposed to try to reach that underlying quality requirement. Why must
        open-source software be used, as stated in CON-2? Perhaps because of a
        desire for increased modifiability, so that’s the requirement that
        leads to the constraint. Why must a specific version of .NET be used,
        per CON-3? Perhaps because of an implicit portability or reliability
        requirement. Remember, a constraint is a perceived solution; asking
        “why” can lead you to the requirement for which it is thought to be a
        solution.</p></div><div class="book" title="Handling quality attributes on agile projects"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3044">Handling quality attributes on agile projects</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-546" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-590" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1572" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1824" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-3045" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2368" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2467" class="calibre"></a>It can be difficult and expensive to retrofit desired
        quality characteristics into a product late in development or after
        delivery. That’s why even agile projects that develop requirements and
        deliver functionality in small increments need to specify significant
        quality attributes and constraints early in the project. This allows
        developers to make appropriate architectural and design decisions as a
        foundation for the desired quality characteristics. Nonfunctional
        requirements need to have priority alongside user stories; you can’t
        defer their implementation until a later iteration.</p><p class="calibre3">It’s possible to specify quality attributes in the form of
        stories:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">As a help desk technician, I want the knowledge base
          to respond to queries within five seconds so the customer doesn’t
          get frustrated and hang up.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">However, quality requirements are not implemented in the same
        discrete way as user stories. They can span multiple stories and
        multiple iterations. Nor are they always readily divisible into
        smaller chunks to be implemented across multiple iterations like user
        stories.</p><p class="calibre3">Developers need to keep nonfunctional requirements in mind as
        they consider the implications of implementing individual user
        stories. As more functionality is added through a series of
        iterations, the system’s efficiency and hence performance can
        deteriorate. Specify performance goals and begin performance testing
        with early iterations, so you can become aware of concerns early
        enough to take corrective actions.</p><p class="calibre3">As you saw in <a class="xref" title="Table 14-5. Translating quality attributes into technical specifications" href="#calibre_link-287">Table&nbsp;14-5</a>, some quality
        attributes are the source of derived functionality. On an agile
        project, quality requirements can spawn new items for the product
        backlog. Consider the following security requirement:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">As an account owner, I want to prevent unauthorized
          users from accessing my account so I don’t lose any
          money.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">This requirement would lead the product owner or business
        analyst on the project to derive multiple user stories that describe
        the security-related functionality. These stories can be added to the
        backlog and planned for implementation in specific iterations in the
        usual fashion. Understanding these requirements up front ensures that
        the team implements the security requirements at the right
        time.</p><p class="calibre3">As with user stories, it’s possible to write acceptance tests
        for quality attributes. This is a way to quantify the quality
        attributes. If a performance goal is stated simply as “The knowledge
        base must return search results quickly,” you can’t write tests to
        define what constitutes “quickly.” A better acceptance test would
        be:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Keyword search of the knowledge base takes less than
          5 seconds, and preferably less than 3 seconds, to return a
          result.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">Acceptance tests written in this form can present several
        acceptable levels of satisfaction for the requirement, much like the
        Goal, Stretch, and Wish keywords used in Planguage, as discussed
        earlier in this chapter. You could use the Planguage keywords Scale
        and Meter to define more precisely what exactly is meant by “return a
        result” and how to perform the test and evaluate the results.</p><p class="calibre3">Part of accepting an iteration as being complete is to assess
        whether the pertinent nonfunctional requirements are satisfied. Often
        there is a range of acceptable performance, with some outcomes more
        desirable than others. As it does for any other software development
        approach, satisfying quality requirements can distinguish delight from
        disappointment on agile projects.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3046" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Next steps</div><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Identify several quality attributes from <a class="xref" title="Table 14-1. Some software quality attributes" href="#calibre_link-267">Table&nbsp;14-1</a> that might be

      have users tell them, “Nope, that’s not right; try again.” To be sure,
      envisioning a future software system and articulating its requirements
      is hard. People have difficulty describing their needs without having
      something tangible in front of them to contemplate; critiquing is much
      easier than conceiving.</p><p class="calibre3">Software prototyping takes a tentative step into the solution
      space. It makes the requirements more real, brings use cases to life,
      and closes gaps in your understanding of the requirements. Prototyping
      puts a mock-up or an initial slice of a new system in front of users to
      stimulate their thinking and catalyze the requirements dialog. Early
      feedback on prototypes helps stakeholders arrive at a shared
      understanding of the system’s requirements, which reduces the risk of
      customer dissatisfaction.</p><p class="calibre3">Even if you apply the requirements development practices described
      in earlier chapters, portions of your requirements might still be
      uncertain or unclear to customers, developers, or both. If you don’t
      correct these problems, an expectation gap between a user’s vision of
      the product and a developer’s understanding of what to build is
      guaranteed. Prototyping is a powerful way to introduce those
      all-important customer contact points that can reduce the expectation
      gap described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 2. Requirements from the customer’s perspective" href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter&nbsp;2</a> It’s hard to
      visualize exactly how software will behave by reading textual
      requirements or studying analysis models. Users are more willing to try
      out a prototype (which is fun) than to read an SRS (which is tedious).
      When you hear <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">IKIWISI</em></span> from your users, think about
      what you can provide that would help them articulate their needs or help
      you better understand what they have in mind (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-290">[ref021]</a>). Prototypes are also a valuable tool for
      requirements validation. A business analyst can have users interact with
      prototypes to see if a product based on the prototype would truly meet
      their needs.</p><p class="calibre3">The word <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">prototype</em></span> has multiple meanings, and
      participants in a prototyping activity can hold very different
      expectations. A prototype airplane actually flies&mdash;it’s the first
      instance of a new type of airplane. In contrast, a software prototype is
      only a portion or a model of a real system&mdash;it might not do anything
      useful at all. Software prototypes can be static designs or working
      models; quick sketches or highly detailed screens; visual displays or
      full slices of functionality; or simulations (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-291">[ref226]</a>;
      <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-240">[ref049]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3">This chapter describes how prototyping provides value to the
      project and different kinds of prototypes you might create for different
      purposes. It also offers guidance on how to use them during requirements
      development, as well as ways to make prototyping an effective part of
      your software engineering process.</p><div class="book" title="Prototyping: What and why"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3048">Prototyping: What and why</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">A software <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">prototype</em></span> is a partial,
        possible, or preliminary implementation of a proposed new product.
        Prototypes can serve three major purposes, and that purpose must be
        made clear from the very beginning:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p title="Clarify, complete, and validate requirements" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Clarify, complete, and validate
              requirements</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;Used as a requirements tool, the prototype assists in
              obtaining agreement, finding errors and omissions, and assessing
              the accuracy and quality of the requirements. User evaluation of
              the prototype points out problems with requirements and uncovers
              overlooked requirements, which you can correct at low cost
              before you construct the actual product. This is especially
              helpful for parts of the system that are not well understood or
              are particularly risky or complex.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Explore design alternatives" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Explore design
              alternatives</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;Used as a design tool, a prototype lets stakeholders
              explore different user interaction techniques, envision the
              final product, optimize system usability, and evaluate potential
              technical approaches. Prototypes can demonstrate requirements
              feasibility through working designs. They’re useful for
              confirming the developer’s understanding of the requirements
              before constructing the actual solution.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Create a subset that will grow into the ultimate product" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Create a subset that will grow
              into the ultimate product</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;Used as a construction tool, a prototype is a functional
              implementation of a subset of the product, which can be
              elaborated into the complete product through a sequence of
              small-scale development cycles. This is a safe approach only if
              the prototype is carefully designed with eventual release
              intended from the beginning.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">The primary reason for creating a prototype is to resolve
        uncertainties early in the development process. You don’t need to
        prototype the entire product. Focus on high-risk areas or known
        uncertainties to decide which parts of the system to prototype and
        what you hope to learn from the prototype evaluations. A prototype is
        useful for revealing and resolving ambiguity and incompleteness in the
        requirements. Users, managers, and other nontechnical stakeholders
        find that prototypes give them something concrete to contemplate while
        the product is being specified and designed. For each prototype you
        create, make sure you know&mdash;and communicate&mdash;why you’re creating it,
        what you expect to learn from it, and what you’ll do with the
        prototype after you’ve had people evaluate it.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1361" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1401" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1783" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1796" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1798" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2126" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2428" class="calibre"></a>Because of the risk of confusion, it’s important to put
        some descriptors in front of the word “prototype” so the project
        participants understand why and when you might create one type of
        prototype or another. This chapter describes three classes of
        prototype attributes, each of which has two alternatives:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p title="Scope" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Scope</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;A mock-up prototype focuses on the user experience; a
              proof-of-concept prototype explores the technical soundness of a
              proposed approach.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Future use" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Future use</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;A throwaway prototype is discarded after it has been used
              to generate feedback, whereas an evolutionary prototype grows
              into the final product through a series of iterations.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Form" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Form</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;A paper prototype is a simple sketch drawn on paper, a
              whiteboard, or in a drawing tool. An electronic prototype
              consists of working software for just part of the
              solution.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Each prototype you create will possess a specific combination of
        these attributes. For instance, you could devise a throwaway paper
        mock-up having simple drawings of possible screens. Or you might build
        an evolutionary electronic proof-of-concept, working software that
        demonstrates a desired technical capability that you can then grow
        into a deliverable product. Certain combinations don’t make sense,
        though. For instance, you couldn’t create an evolutionary paper proof
        of concept.</p></div><div class="book" title="Mock-ups and proofs of concept"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3049">Mock-ups and proofs of concept</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">When people say “software prototype,” they are usually thinking
        about a <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">mock-up</em></span> of a possible user interface. A
        mock-up is also called a <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">horizontal prototype</em></span>.
        Such a prototype focuses on a portion of the user interface; it
        doesn’t dive into all the architectural layers or into detailed
        functionality. This type of prototype lets you explore some specific
        behaviors of the intended system, with the goal of refining the
        requirements. The mock-up helps users judge whether a system based on
        the prototype will let them do their job in a reasonable way.</p><p class="calibre3">A mock-up implies behavior without actually implementing it. It
        displays the facades of user interface screens and permits some
        navigation between them, but it contains little or no real
        functionality. Think of the set for a Western movie: the cowboy walks
        into the saloon and then walks out of the livery stable, yet he
        doesn’t have a drink and he doesn’t see a horse because there’s
        nothing behind the false fronts of the buildings.</p><p class="calibre3">Mock-ups can demonstrate the functional options the user will
        have available, the look and feel of the user interface (colors,
        layout, graphics, controls), and the navigation structure. The
        navigations might work, but at certain points the user might see only
        a message that describes what would really be displayed or will find
        that some controls don’t do anything. The information that appears in
        response to a database query could be faked or constant, and report
        contents are hardcoded. If you create a mock-up, try to use actual
        data in sample displays and outputs. This enhances the validity of the
        prototype as a model of the real system, but be sure to make it clear
        to the prototype evaluators that the displays and outputs are
        simulated, not live.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1175" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1804" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1810" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1815" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2305" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2523" class="calibre"></a>A mock-up doesn’t perform any useful work, although it
        looks as if it should. The simulation is often good enough to let the
        users judge whether any functionality is missing, wrong, or
        unnecessary. Some prototypes represent the developer’s concept of how
        a specific use case might be implemented. User evaluations of the
        prototype can point out alternative flows for the use case, missing
        interaction steps, additional exceptions, overlooked postconditions,
        and pertinent business rules.</p><p class="calibre3">When working with a throwaway mock-up prototype, the user should
        focus on broad requirements and workflow issues without becoming
        distracted by the precise appearance of screen elements (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-292">[ref048]</a>). Don’t worry at this stage about exactly where
        the screen elements will be positioned, fonts, colors, or graphics.
        The time to explore the specifics of user interface design is after
        you’ve clarified the requirements and determined the general structure
        of the interface. With an evolutionary mock-up, building in those
        refinements moves the user interface closer to being
        releasable.</p><p class="calibre3">A <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">proof of concept</em></span>, also known as a
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">vertical prototype</em></span>, implements a slice of
        application functionality from the user interface through all the
        technical services layers. A proof-of-concept prototype works like the
        real system is supposed to work because it touches on all levels of
        the system implementation. Develop a proof of concept when you’re
        uncertain whether a proposed architectural approach is feasible and
        sound, or when you want to optimize algorithms, evaluate a proposed
        database schema, confirm the soundness of a cloud solution, or test
        critical timing requirements. To make the results meaningful, such
        prototypes are constructed by using production tools in a
        production-like operating environment. A proof of concept is also
        useful for gathering information to improve the team’s ability to
        estimate the effort involved in implementing a specific user story or
        block of functionality. Agile development projects sometimes refer to
        a proof-of-concept prototype as a “spike.”</p><p class="calibre3">I once worked with a team that wanted to implement an unusual
        client/server architecture as part of a transitional strategy from a
        mainframe-centric world to an application environment based on
        networked UNIX servers and workstations (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-293">[ref231]</a>). A
        proof-of-concept prototype that implemented just a bit of the user
        interface client (on a mainframe) and the corresponding server
        functionality (on a UNIX workstation) allowed us to evaluate the
        communication components, performance, and reliability of our proposed
        architecture. The experiment was a success, as was the ultimate
        implementation based on that architecture.</p></div><div class="book" title="Throwaway and evolutionary prototypes"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3050">Throwaway and evolutionary prototypes</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Before constructing a prototype, make an explicit and
        well-communicated decision as to whether the prototype is exploratory
        only or will become part of the delivered product. Build a
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">throwaway prototype</em></span> to answer questions, resolve
        uncertainties, and improve requirements quality (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-294">[ref054]</a>). Because you’ll discard the prototype after it
        has served its purpose, build it as quickly and cheaply as you can.
        The more effort you invest in the prototype, the more reluctant the
        project participants are to discard it and the less time you will have
        available to build the real product.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-574" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1015" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1404" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1792" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2438" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2559" class="calibre"></a>You don’t have to throw the prototype away if you see
        merit in keeping it for possible future use. However, it won’t be
        incorporated into the delivered product. For this reason, you might
        prefer to call it a <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">nonreleasable
        prototype.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">When developers build a throwaway prototype, they ignore solid
        software construction techniques. A throwaway prototype emphasizes
        quick implementation and modification over robustness, reliability,
        performance, and long-term maintainability. For this reason, you must
        not allow low-quality code from a throwaway prototype to migrate into
        a production system. If you do, the users and the maintainers will
        suffer the consequences for the life of the product.</p><p class="calibre3">A throwaway prototype is most appropriate when the team faces
        uncertainty, ambiguity, incompleteness, or vagueness in the
        requirements, or when they have difficulty envisioning the system from
        the requirements alone. Resolving these issues reduces the risks of
        proceeding with construction. A prototype that helps users and
        developers visualize how the requirements might be implemented can
        reveal gaps in the requirements. It also lets users judge whether the
        requirements will enable the necessary business processes.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3051" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Don’t make a throwaway prototype more elaborate than is
          necessary to meet the prototyping objectives. Resist the
          temptation&mdash;or the pressure from users&mdash;to keep adding more
          capabilities to the prototype.</p></div><p class="calibre3">A <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">wireframe</em></span> is a particular approach to
        throwaway prototyping commonly used for custom user interface design
        and website design. You can use wireframes to reach a better
        understanding of three aspects of a website:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The conceptual requirements</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The information architecture or navigation design</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The high-resolution, detailed design of the pages</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">The pages sketched when exploring conceptual requirements in the
        first type of wireframe need not resemble the final screens. This
        wireframe is useful for working with users to understand the types of
        activities they might want to perform at the screen. Paper prototypes
        can work fine for this purpose, as described later in this chapter.
        The second type of wireframe need not involve page designs at all. The
        analysis model called the dialog map, described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 12. A picture is worth 1024 words" href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter&nbsp;12</a> is an excellent tool for
        exploring and iterating on page navigation for a website. The third
        type of wireframe gets into the details of what the final pages would
        look like.</p><p class="calibre3">In contrast to a throwaway prototype, an <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">evolutionary
        prototype</em></span> provides a solid architectural foundation for
        building the product incrementally as the requirements become clear
        over time (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-295">[ref164]</a>). Agile development provides an
        example of evolutionary prototyping. Agile teams construct the product
        through a series of iterations, using feedback on the early iterations
        to adjust the direction of future development cycles. This is the
        essence of evolutionary prototyping.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1500" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1784" class="calibre"></a>In contrast to the quick-and-dirty nature of throwaway
        prototyping, an evolutionary prototype must be built with robust,
        production-quality code from the outset. Therefore, an evolutionary
        prototype takes longer to create than a throwaway prototype that
        simulates the same system capabilities. An evolutionary prototype must
        be designed for easy growth and frequent enhancement, so developers
        must emphasize software architecture and solid design principles.
        There’s no room for shortcuts in the quality of an evolutionary
        prototype.</p><p class="calibre3">Think of the first iteration of an evolutionary prototype as a
        pilot release that implements an initial portion of the requirements.
        Lessons learned from user acceptance testing and initial usage lead to
        modifications in the next iteration. The full product is the
        culmination of a series of evolutionary prototyping cycles. Such
        prototypes quickly get useful functionality into the hands of the
        users. Evolutionary prototypes work well for applications that you
        know will grow over time, but that can be valuable to users without
        having all the planned functionality implemented. Agile projects often
        are planned such that they could stop development at the end of an
        iteration and still have a product that is useful for customers, even
        though it is incomplete.</p><p class="calibre3">Evolutionary prototyping is well suited for web development
        projects. On one such project, my team created a series of four
        prototypes, based on requirements that we developed from a use case
        analysis. Several users evaluated each prototype, and we revised each
        one based on their responses to questions we posed. The revisions
        following the fourth prototype evaluation resulted in the production
        website.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 15-1. Several possible ways to incorporate prototyping into the software development process." href="#calibre_link-296">Figure&nbsp;15-1</a>
        illustrates several possible ways to combine the various prototypes.
        For example, you can use the knowledge gained from a series of
        throwaway prototypes to refine the requirements, which you might then
        implement incrementally through an evolutionary prototyping sequence.
        An alternative path through <a class="xref" title="Figure 15-1. Several possible ways to incorporate prototyping into the software development process." href="#calibre_link-296">Figure&nbsp;15-1</a> uses a throwaway
        mock-up to clarify the requirements prior to finalizing the user
        interface design, while a concurrent proof-of-concept prototyping
        effort validates the architecture and core algorithms. What you
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">cannot</em></span> do successfully is turn the deliberately
        low quality of a throwaway prototype into the maintainable robustness
        that a production system demands. In addition, working prototypes that
        appear to get the job done for a handful of concurrent users likely
        won’t scale up to handle thousands of users without major
        architectural changes. <a class="xref" title="Table 15-1. Typical applications of software prototypes" href="#calibre_link-297">Table&nbsp;15-1</a> summarizes some

        requirements uncertainties. A <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">paper prototype</em></span>
        (sometimes called a <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">low-fidelity prototype</em></span>) is a
        cheap, fast, and low-tech way to explore how a portion of an
        implemented system might look (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-298">[ref197]</a>). Paper
        prototypes help you test whether users and developers hold a shared
        understanding of the requirements. They let you take a tentative and
        low-risk step into a possible solution space prior to developing
        production code. A similar deliverable is called a
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">storyboard</em></span> (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-241">[ref158]</a>). Use
        low-fidelity prototypes to explore functionality and flow, and use
        high-fidelity prototypes to determine precise look and feel.</p><p class="calibre3">Paper prototypes involve tools no more sophisticated than paper,
        index cards, sticky notes, and whiteboards. The designer sketches
        ideas of possible screens without worrying about exactly where the
        controls appear and what they look like. Users willingly provide
        feedback on designs drawn on a piece of paper, although they’re
        sometimes less eager to critique a lovely computer-based prototype in
        which it appears the developer has invested a lot of work. Developers,
        too, might resist making substantial changes in a carefully crafted
        electronic prototype.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1789" class="calibre"></a>When a low-fidelity prototype is being evaluated,
        someone plays the role of the computer while a user walks through an
        evaluation scenario. The user initiates actions by saying aloud what
        she would like to do at a specific screen: “I’m going to select Print
        Preview from the File menu.” The person simulating the computer then
        displays the piece of paper or index card that represents the display
        that would appear when the user takes that action. The user can judge
        whether that is indeed the expected response and whether the item
        displayed contains the correct elements. If it’s wrong, you simply
        take a blank page or index card and try again.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3054" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Off to see the wizard</div><p class="calibre3">A development team that designed large commercial photocopiers
          once lamented to me that their previous copier had a usability
          problem. A common copying activity required five discrete steps,
          which the users found clumsy. “I wish we’d prototyped that activity
          before we designed the copier,” one developer said wistfully.</p><p class="calibre3">How do you prototype a product as complex as a photocopier?
          First, buy a refrigerator. Write <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">COPIER</em></span> on the
          side of the box that it came in. Have someone sit inside the box,
          and ask a user to stand outside the box and simulate doing copier
          activities. The person inside the box responds in the way he expects
          the copier to respond, and the user representative observes whether
          that response is what he has in mind. A simple, fun prototype like
          this&mdash;sometimes called a <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Wizard of Oz
          prototype</em></span>&mdash;stimulates the early user feedback that
          effectively guides the development team’s design decisions. Plus,
          you get to keep the refrigerator.</p></div><p class="calibre3">No matter how efficient your prototyping tools are, sketching
        displays on paper or a whiteboard is faster. Paper prototyping
        facilitates rapid iteration, and iteration is a key success factor in
        requirements development. Paper prototyping is an excellent technique
        for refining the requirements prior to designing detailed user
        interfaces, constructing an evolutionary prototype, or undertaking
        traditional design and construction activities. It also helps the
        development team manage customer expectations.</p><p class="calibre3">Numerous tools are available if you decide to build an
        electronic throwaway prototype. They range from simple drawing tools
        such as Microsoft Visio and Microsoft PowerPoint to commercial
        prototyping tools and graphical user interface builders. Tools also
        are available specifically for creating website wireframes. Such tools
        will let you easily implement and modify user interface components,
        regardless of how inefficient the temporary code behind the interface
        is. Of course, if you’re building an evolutionary prototype, you must
        use production development tools from the outset. Because tools and
        their vendors change so rapidly, we won’t suggest specific ones
        here.</p><p class="calibre3">Various tools are commercially available that let you simulate
        your application before you build it. Application simulation lets you
        quickly assemble screen layouts, user interface controls, navigation
        flow, and functionality into something that closely resembles the
        product you think you need to build. The ability to iterate on the
        simulation provides a valuable mechanism for interacting with user
        representatives to clarify requirements and revise your thinking about
        the solution.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1817" class="calibre"></a>With any kind of prototyping&mdash;paper prototypes,
        wireframes, electronic prototypes, or simulations&mdash;the business analyst
        must be careful not get drawn into high-precision user interface
        designs prematurely. Prototype evaluators often offer feedback like
        “Can this text be a little darker red?”, “Let’s move this box up just
        a little,” or “I don’t like that font.” Unless the purpose of the
        prototype is to perform detailed screen or webpage design, those sorts
        of comments are just distractions. The color, font, and box
        positioning are immaterial if the application doesn’t properly support
        the users’ business tasks. Until you’re sure you have a rich
        understanding of the necessary functionality, focus the prototyping
        efforts on refining requirements, not visual designs.</p></div><div class="book" title="Working with prototypes"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3055">Working with prototypes</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 15-2. Activity sequence from use cases to user interface design using a throwaway prototype." href="#calibre_link-299">Figure&nbsp;15-2</a>
        shows one possible sequence of development activities that moves from
        use cases to detailed user interface design with the help of a
        throwaway prototype. Each use case description includes a sequence of
        actor actions and system responses, which you can model by using a
        dialog map to depict a possible user interface architecture. A
        throwaway prototype or a wireframe elaborates the dialog elements into
        specific screens, menus, and dialog boxes. When users evaluate the
        prototype, their feedback might lead to changes in the use case
        descriptions (if, say, an alternative flow is discovered) or to
        changes in the dialog map. After the requirements are refined and the
        screens sketched, each user interface element can be optimized for
        usability. These activities don’t need to be performed strictly
        sequentially. Iterating on the use case, the dialog map, and the
        wireframe is the best way to quickly reach an acceptable and
        agreed-upon approach to user interface design.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-299" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3056" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000063.jpeg" alt="Activity sequence from use cases to user interface design using a throwaway prototype." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;15-2.&nbsp;Activity sequence from use cases to user interface design
          using a throwaway prototype.</div></div><p class="calibre3">This progressive refinement approach is cheaper than leaping
        directly from use case descriptions to a complete user interface
        implementation and then discovering major issues that necessitate
        extensive rework. You only need to perform as many steps in this
        sequence as are necessary to acceptably reduce the risk of going wrong
        on the user interface design. If your team is confident that they
        understand the requirements, that the requirements are sufficiently
        complete, and that they have a good handle on the right UI to build,
        then there’s little point in prototyping. Also, you can focus
        prototyping on user requirements that have a big risk of error or a
        big impact if there is a problem. One project performed an e-commerce
        website redesign for a major corporation that would be used by
        millions of users. The team prototyped the core elements of the
        website, including the online catalog, shopping cart, and checkout
        process, to make sure they got those right the first time. They spent
        less time exploring exception paths and less commonly used
        scenarios.</p><p class="calibre3">To help make this whole process more tangible, let’s look at an
        actual example, a small website to promote a book, a memoir of life
        lessons called <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Pearls from Sand</em></span>. The author of
        the book (Karl, actually) thought of several things that visitors
        should be able to do at the website, each of which is a use case.
        There are additional use cases for other user classes (<a class="xref" title="Table 15-2. Some use cases for PearlsFromSand.com" href="#calibre_link-300">Table&nbsp;15-2</a>).</p><div class="table"><a id="calibre_link-300" class="calibre"></a><div class="table-title">Table&nbsp;15-2.&nbsp;Some use cases for PearlsFromSand.com</div><div class="book"><table class="calibre7"><colgroup class="calibre8"><col class="col"></col><col class="col"></col></colgroup><tbody class="calibre9"><tr class="calibre10"><td class="calibre11"><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">User

        provide and imagine the navigation pathways between them. The final
        website might not implement all of these pages separately. Some pages
        might be condensed together; others might function as pop-ups or other
        modifications of a single page. <a class="xref" title="Figure 15-3. Partial dialog map for PearlsFromSand.com." href="#calibre_link-301">Figure&nbsp;15-3</a> illustrates a

        architecture. Each box represents a page that would contribute to
        providing the services identified in the use cases. The arrows
        represent links to enable navigation from one page to another. While
        drawing a dialog map, you might discover new actions a user would want
        to perform. While working through a use case, you might find ways to
        simplify and streamline the user’s experience.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-301" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3057" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000064.jpeg" alt="Partial dialog map for PearlsFromSand.com." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;15-3.&nbsp;Partial dialog map for PearlsFromSand.com.</div></div><p class="calibre3">The next step was to construct a throwaway prototype or a
        wireframe of selected pages to work out the visual design approach.
        Each of these can be a hand-drawn sketch on paper (see the example in
        <a class="xref" title="Figure 10-1. Example of a user interface “sketch” suitable for inclusion in a requirements document." href="#calibre_link-205">Figure&nbsp;10-1</a> in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 10. Documenting the requirements" href="#calibre_link-38">Chapter&nbsp;10</a>), a simple line drawing, or
        a mock-up created with a dedicated prototyping or visual design tool.
        The wireframe illustrated in <a class="xref" title="Figure 15-4. Sample wireframe of one page for PearlsFromSand.com." href="#calibre_link-302">Figure&nbsp;15-4</a> was drawn by
        using PowerPoint in just a few minutes. Such a simple diagram is a
        tool to work with user representatives to understand the broad strokes
        of what sort of page layout and cosmetic features would make the pages
        easy to understand and use.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-302" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3058" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000065.jpeg" alt="A simple drawing of a possible webpage design that shows               the general layout of images, links, text, and buttons without               showing any details." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;15-4.&nbsp;Sample wireframe of one page for PearlsFromSand.com.</div></div><p class="calibre3">Finally, the fourth step illustrated in <a class="xref" title="Figure 15-2. Activity sequence from use cases to user interface design using a throwaway prototype." href="#calibre_link-299">Figure&nbsp;15-2</a> is to create a

        This iterative approach to user interface design leads to better
        results than diving immediately into high-resolution page design
        without having a clear understanding of what members of various user
        classes will want to do when they visit a website.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-303" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3059" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000066.jpeg" alt="A screenshot of the final webpage that resulted from the               prototyping activities." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;15-5.&nbsp;A final implemented page from PearlsFromSand.com.</div></div></div><div class="book" title="Prototype evaluation"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3060">Prototype evaluation</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1791" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2290" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2371" class="calibre"></a>Prototype evaluation is related to usability testing
        (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-304">[ref209]</a>). You’ll learn more by watching users work
        with the prototype than just by asking them to tell you what they
        think of it. Watch where the user’s fingers or mouse pointer try to go
        instinctively. Spot places where the prototype conflicts with the
        behavior of other applications that the evaluators use. The evaluator
        might try incorrect keyboard shortcuts or have to “mouse around”
        hunting for the correct menu option. Look for the furrowed brow that
        indicates a puzzled user who can’t determine what to do next, how to
        navigate to a desired destination, or how to take a side trip to
        another part of the application. See if the prototype has any dead
        ends, as happens sometimes when a user submits a form on a
        website.</p><p class="calibre3">Have the right people evaluate the prototype from the
        appropriate perspectives. Include members of multiple user classes,
        both experienced and inexperienced. When you present the prototype to
        the evaluators, stress that it addresses only a portion of the
        functionality; the rest will be implemented when the actual system is
        developed.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3061" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1809" class="calibre"></a>As with any usability testing, watch out for omitting
          members of significant user classes from the prototype evaluation. A
          novice user might love a prototype for its apparent ease of use, but
          a more experienced or power user could hate the way it slows him
          down. Make sure both groups are represented.</p></div><p class="calibre3">To improve the evaluation of user interface prototypes, create
        scripts that guide the users through a series of operations and ask
        specific questions to elicit the information you seek. This
        supplements a general invitation to “tell me what you think of this
        prototype.” Derive the evaluation scripts from the use cases, user
        stories, or features that the prototype addresses. The script asks
        evaluators to perform specific tasks, working through the parts of the
        prototype that have the most uncertainty. At the end of each task, and
        possibly at intermediate points, the script presents specific
        task-related questions. You might also ask general questions like the
        following:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Does the prototype implement the functionality in the way
            you expected?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">What functionality is missing from the prototype?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Can you think of any possible error conditions that the
            prototype doesn’t address?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Are any unnecessary functions present?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">How logical and complete does the navigation seem to
            you?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Are there ways to simplify any of the tasks that require too
            many interaction steps?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Were you ever unsure of what to do next?</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Ask evaluators to share their thoughts aloud as they work with
        the prototype so that you understand what they’re thinking and can
        detect any issues that the prototype handles poorly. Create a
        nonjudgmental environment in which the evaluators feel free to express
        their thoughts, ideas, and concerns. Avoid coaching users on the
        “right” way to perform some function with the prototype.</p><p class="calibre3">Document what you learn from the prototype evaluation. Use the
        information from a mock-up prototype to refine the requirements. If
        the evaluation led to some user-interface design decisions, such as
        the selection of specific interaction techniques, record those
        conclusions and how you arrived at them. Decisions that lack the
        accompanying thought processes tend to be revisited repeatedly. For a
        proof of concept, document the evaluations you performed and their
        results, culminating in the decisions you made about the technical
        approaches explored. Resolve any conflicts between the specified
        requirements and the prototype.</p></div><div class="book" title="Risks of prototyping"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3062">Risks of prototyping</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Creating even a simple prototype costs time and money. Although
        prototyping reduces the risk of software project failure, it poses its
        own risks, some of which are explained in this section.</p><div class="book" title="Pressure to release the prototype"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3063">Pressure to release the prototype</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The biggest risk is that a stakeholder will see a running
          throwaway prototype and conclude that the product is nearly
          completed. “Wow, it looks like you’re almost done!” says the
          enthusiastic prototype evaluator. “This looks great. Can you just
          finish this up and give it to me?”</p><p class="calibre3">In a word: NO! A throwaway prototype is never intended for
          production use, no matter how much it looks like the real thing. It
          is merely a model, a simulation, an experiment. Unless there’s a
          compelling business motivation to achieve a marketplace presence
          immediately (and management accepts the resulting high maintenance
          burden and risk of annoyed users), resist the pressure to deliver a
          throwaway prototype. Delivering this prototype will likely delay the
          project’s completion because the design and code were intentionally
          created without regard to quality or durability. Expectation
          management is a key to successful prototyping. Everyone who sees the
          prototype must understand its purpose and its limitations. Be clear
          about why you are creating specific kinds of prototypes, decide what
          their ultimate fate will be, and communicate this clearly to those
          stakeholders who are involved with them.</p><p class="calibre3">Don’t let the fear of premature delivery pressure dissuade you
          from creating prototypes, though. Make it clear to those who see the
          prototype that you will not release it as production software. One
          way to control this risk is to use paper, rather than electronic,
          prototypes. No one who evaluates a paper prototype will think the
          product is nearly done! Another option is to use prototyping tools
          that are different from those used for actual development. No one
          will mistake a navigable PowerPoint mock-up or a simple wireframe
          for the real thing. This will help you resist pressure to “just
          finish up” the prototype and ship it. Leaving the prototype looking
          a bit rough and unpolished also mitigates this risk. Some of the
          many tools available for creating wireframes allow for the quick
          development of a high-fidelity user interface. This increases the
          likelihood of people expecting that the software is almost done, and
          it adds to the pressure to transform a throwaway prototype into an
          evolutionary one.</p><p class="calibre3">One developer cobbled together an executable prototype of a
          user interface with a shocking pink motif. As he explained it, “When
          we showed the customers the first couple of iterations with this
          color scheme, NO ONE thought this was a close-to-finished product. I
          actually retained that abomination for an additional iteration just
          to avoid falling into some of these prototyping risk traps.”</p></div><div class="book" title="Distraction by details"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3064">Distraction by details</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Another risk of prototyping is that users become fixated on
          details about how the user interface will look and operate. When
          working with real-looking prototypes, it’s easy for users to forget
          that they should be primarily concerned with conceptual issues at
          the requirements stage. Limit the prototype to the displays,
          functions, and navigation options that will let you clear up
          uncertain requirements.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3065" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Baby with the bath water</div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-575" class="calibre"></a>I once consulted at a company where a senior manager
            had banned prototyping. He had seen projects in which customers
            pressured developers into delivering throwaway prototypes
            prematurely as the final product, with predictable results. The
            prototypes did not handle user errors or bad input data well, did
            not cover all the options users wanted, and were difficult to
            maintain and enhance. These unpleasant experiences led the senior
            manager to conclude that prototyping could only lead to
            trouble.</p><p class="calibre3">As you’ve seen in this chapter, delivering to customers a
            prototype that was intended to be discarded and calling it a
            product certainly will cause problems. Nonetheless, prototyping
            offers a range of powerful techniques that can contribute
            substantially to building the right product. Rather than
            dismissing prototyping as a dangerous method to be avoided, it’s
            important to make sure everyone involved understands the various
            kinds of prototypes, why a particular prototype is being created,
            and how the results will be used.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Unrealistic performance expectations"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3066">Unrealistic performance expectations</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">A third risk is that users will infer the expected performance
          of the final product from the prototype’s performance. You won’t be
          evaluating a mock-up in the intended production environment, though.
          You might have built it using tools or languages that differ in
          efficiency from the production development tools, such as
          interpreted scripts versus compiled code. A proof-of-concept
          prototype might not use tuned algorithms, or it could lack security
          layers that will reduce the ultimate performance. If evaluators see
          the prototype respond instantaneously to a simulated database query
          using hard-coded sample query results, they might expect the same
          fabulous performance in the production software with an enormous
          distributed database. Consider building in time delays to more
          realistically simulate the expected behavior of the final
          product&mdash;and perhaps to make the prototype look even less ready for
          immediate delivery. You might put a message on the screen to clearly
          state that this is not necessarily representative of the final
          system.</p><p class="calibre3">In agile development and other evolutionary prototyping
          situations, be sure to design a robust and extendable architecture
          and craft high-quality code from the beginning. You’re building
          production software, just a small portion at a time. You can tune up
          the design through refactoring in later iterations, but don’t
          substitute refactoring in the future for thinking about design
          today.</p></div><div class="book" title="Investing excessive effort in prototypes"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3067">Investing excessive effort in prototypes</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Finally, beware of prototyping activities that consume so much
          effort that the development team runs out of time and is forced to
          deliver the prototype as the product or to rush through a haphazard
          product implementation. This can happen when you are prototyping the
          whole solution rather than only the most uncertain, high-risk, or
          complex portions. Treat a prototype as an experiment. You’re testing
          the hypothesis that the requirements are sufficiently defined and
          the key human-computer interface and architectural issues are
          resolved so that design and construction can proceed. Do just enough
          prototyping to test the hypothesis, answer the questions, and refine
          the requirements.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Prototyping success factors"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3068">Prototyping success factors</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1177" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1333" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1795" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2524" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2560" class="calibre"></a>Software prototyping provides a powerful set of

        guidelines:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Include prototyping tasks in your project plan. Schedule

            prototypes.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">State the purpose of each prototype before you build it, and
            explain what will happen with the outcome: either discard (or
            archive) the prototype, retaining the knowledge it provided, or
            build upon it to grow it into the ultimate solution. Make sure
            those who build the prototypes and those who evaluate them
            understand these intentions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Plan to develop multiple prototypes. You’ll rarely get them
            right on the first try, which is the whole point of
            prototyping!</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Create throwaway prototypes as quickly and cheaply as
            possible. Invest the minimum amount of effort that will answer
            questions or resolve requirements uncertainties. Don’t try to
            perfect a throwaway prototype.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Don’t include input data validations, defensive coding
            techniques, error-handling code, or extensive code documentation
            in a throwaway prototype. It’s an unnecessary investment of effort
            that you’re just going to discard.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Don’t prototype requirements that you already understand,
            except to explore design alternatives.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Use plausible data in prototype screen displays and reports.
            Evaluators can be distracted by unrealistic data and fail to focus
            on the prototype as a model of how the real system might look and
            behave.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Don’t expect a prototype to replace written requirements. A
            lot of behind-the-scenes functionality is only implied by the
            prototype and should be documented in an SRS to make it complete,
            specific, and traceable. Screen images don’t give the details of
            data field definitions and validation criteria, relationships
            between fields (such as UI controls that appear only if the user
            makes certain selections in other controls), exception handling,
            business rules, and other essential bits of information.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Thoughtfully applied and skillfully executed, prototypes serve

      Chemical Tracking System were identified, the project manager, Dave, and
      the business analyst, Lori, met with two of the product champions. Tim
      represented the chemist community and Roxanne spoke for the chemical
      stockroom staff.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Dave said, “Now that we have a general idea of the main
      capabilities you want, we need to think about allocating some of the
      user stories you’ve identified to the first few iterations. It’s
      important that we agree on where to start so you can begin getting some
      value from the system as quickly as possible. Let’s do a first-cut
      prioritization on these user stories so we know what’s most important to
      you. Then we can learn more about exactly what you expect from each of
      those initial capabilities.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Tim was puzzled. “Why do you need the requirements
      prioritized? They’re all important, or we wouldn’t have given them to
      you.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Lori, the BA, explained, “We know they’re all important,
      but we need to address the most urgent requirements in the first few
      iterations. We’re asking you to help us distinguish the requirements
      that must be included initially from those that can wait for later
      iterations. Can you think of certain functionality that would provide
      the greatest immediate value to chemists or other user
      classes?”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“I know that the reports that the Health and Safety
      Department needs to generate for the government have to be available
      soon or the company will get in trouble,” Roxanne pointed out. “We can
      use our current inventory system for a few more months if we have
      to.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Tim added, “I promised the online catalog search
      function to the chemists as a way for this system to save them time. Can
      we please start on that right away? It doesn’t have to be perfect, but
      we want to get access to the catalogs as quickly as we
      can.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Tim and Roxanne realized that, because the project
      couldn’t deliver every desired feature at the same time, it would be
      better if everyone could agree on the set to implement first. They
      continued sorting their user stories into a top-priority category for
      early implementation and others that could wait a
      while.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">Few software projects deliver all the capabilities that all
      stakeholders want by the targeted initial delivery date. Every project
      with resource limitations needs to define the relative priorities of the
      requested product capabilities. Prioritization, also called
      <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">requirements triage</em></span> (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-23">[ref056]</a>),
      helps reveal competing goals, resolve conflicts, plan for staged or
      incremental deliveries, control scope creep, and make the necessary
      trade-off decisions. This chapter discusses the importance of
      prioritizing requirements, describes several prioritization techniques,
      and presents a spreadsheet tool for prioritization analysis based on
      value, cost, and risk.</p><div class="book" title="Why prioritize requirements?"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3071">Why prioritize requirements?</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-580" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-895" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-3072" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2469" class="calibre"></a>When customer expectations are high and timelines are
        short, you need to make sure the product delivers the most critical or
        valuable functionality as early as possible. Prioritization is a way
        to deal with competing demands for limited resources. Establishing the
        relative priority of each product capability lets you plan
        construction to provide the highest value at the lowest cost. Because
        prioritization is relative, you can begin prioritization as soon as
        you discover your second requirement.</p><p class="calibre3">Sometimes customers don’t like to prioritize requirements,
        thinking that they won’t ever get the ones that are low priority.
        Well, if you aren’t going to get everything you’d like, as is often
        the case, you should make sure that you <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">do</em></span> get
        the capabilities that are most important to achieving your business
        objectives. Sometimes developers don’t like to prioritize requirements
        because it gives the impression that they can’t do it all. The reality
        is that they can’t, at least not all at once. Prioritization helps the
        project deliver the maximum business value as quickly as possible
        within the project constraints.</p><p class="calibre3">Prioritization is a critical strategy for agile or other
        projects that develop products through a series of fixed-schedule
        timeboxes. Project teams can populate their product backlog with user
        stories, features, business processes, and defect stories (bugs
        awaiting correction). Customers prioritize the stories in the backlog
        and select which ones they’d like to have implemented in each
        development iteration. Developers estimate the effort involved with
        implementing each story and judge how many of these stories they can
        fit into each iteration, based on their empirically demonstrated
        delivery capacity as measured by the team’s velocity. As new stories
        are proposed, customers assess their priorities against the contents
        of the backlog, thus dynamically adjusting scope for the upcoming
        iterations. All projects should do this to ensure that the team is
        always working on those capabilities that will get useful software in
        the users’ hands as soon as possible.</p><p class="calibre3">On every project, a project manager must balance the desired
        project scope against the constraints of schedule, budget, staff, and
        quality goals (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-66">[ref240]</a>). One way to accomplish this
        is to drop&mdash;or to defer to a later release&mdash;low-priority requirements
        when new, more essential requirements are accepted or when other
        project conditions change. That is, prioritization is a dynamic and
        ongoing process. If customers don’t distinguish their requirements by
        importance and urgency, project managers must make these decisions on
        their own. Not surprisingly, customers might not agree with a project
        manager’s priorities; therefore, customers must indicate which
        requirements are needed initially and which can wait. Establish
        priorities early in the project, when you have more flexibility for
        achieving a successful project outcome, and revisit them
        periodically.</p><p class="calibre3">It’s difficult enough to get any one customer to decide which of
        his requirements are top priority. Achieving consensus among multiple
        customers with diverse expectations is even harder. People naturally
        have their own interests at heart and aren’t eager to compromise their
        needs for someone else’s benefit. However, contributing to
        requirements prioritization is one of the customer’s responsibilities
        in the customer-development partnership, as was discussed in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 2. Requirements from the customer’s perspective" href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>. More than
        simply defining the sequence of requirements implementation,
        discussing priorities helps to clarify the customers’
        expectations.</p></div><div class="book" title="Some prioritization pragmatics"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3073">Some prioritization pragmatics</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-901" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-977" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1298" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1688" class="calibre"></a>Even a medium-sized project can have dozens of user
        requirements and hundreds of functional requirements, too many to
        classify analytically and consistently. To keep it manageable, choose
        an appropriate level of abstraction for the prioritization&mdash;features,
        use cases, user stories, or functional requirements. Within a use
        case, some alternative flows could have a higher priority than others.
        You might decide to do an initial prioritization at the feature level
        and then to prioritize the functional requirements within certain
        features separately. This will help you to distinguish the core
        functionality from refinements that can be deferred or cut entirely.
        As was described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 5. Establishing the business requirements" href="#calibre_link-32">Chapter&nbsp;5</a> feature
        prioritization feeds directly into scope and release planning. Don’t
        lose sight of the low-priority requirements, although there’s no point
        in analyzing them further just yet. Their priority might change later,
        and knowing about them now will help the developers plan for future
        enhancements.</p><p class="calibre3">Various stakeholders need to participate in prioritization,
        representing customers, project sponsors, project management,
        development, and perhaps other perspectives. You really need one
        ultimate decision maker when stakeholders can’t agree. A good starting
        point is for the prioritization participants to agree upon a set of
        criteria to use for judging whether one requirement has higher
        priority than another. The prioritization can include considerations
        of customer value, business value, business or technical risk, cost,
        difficulty of implementation, time to market, regulatory or policy
        compliance, competitive marketplace advantage, and contractual
        commitments (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-77">[ref094]</a>). <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-23">[ref056]</a>
        indicates that successful prioritization requires an understanding of
        six issues:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The needs of the customers</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The relative importance of requirements to the
            customers</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The timing at which capabilities need to be delivered</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Requirements that serve as predecessors for other
            requirements and other relationships among requirements</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Which requirements must be implemented as a group</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The cost to satisfy each requirement</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Customers place a high priority on those functions that provide
        the greatest business or usability benefit. However, after a developer
        points out the cost, difficulty, technical risk, or trade-offs
        associated with a specific requirement, the customers might conclude
        that it isn’t as essential as they first thought. The developer might
        also decide to implement certain lower-priority functions early on
        because of their effect on the system’s architecture, laying the
        foundation to implement future functionality efficiently without major
        restructuring. Some functionality must have high priority because it
        is required to meet regulatory demands for the application. As with
        all aspects of requirements development, the overarching business
        objectives that led to launching the project in the first place should
        drive priority decisions.</p><p class="calibre3">Certain requirements must be implemented together or in a
        specific sequence. It makes no sense to implement a redo edit
        capability in release 1 but not implement the corresponding undo
        capability until some months later. Similarly, suppose you implement
        just the normal flow of a particular use case in release 1, deferring
        the lower-priority alternative flows to some later date. That’s fine,
        but you must also implement the corresponding exception handlers at
        the same time you implement each success flow. Otherwise, you could
        end up writing code to, say, accept credit card payments without
        checking to see if the card is valid, rejecting cards that were
        reported stolen, or handling other exceptions.</p></div><div class="book" title="Games people play with priorities"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3074">Games people play with priorities</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The knee-jerk response to a request for customers to set
        priorities sometimes is, “I need all these features. Just make it
        happen.” They feel that every requirement should be ranked as high
        priority, and they might not recognize that prioritization will help
        to ensure the project’s success. Start by explaining that all things
        cannot be done simultaneously, so you want to make sure you work on
        the right things first. It can be difficult to persuade customers to
        discuss priorities if they know that low-priority requirements might
        never be implemented. One developer told me that it wasn’t politically
        acceptable in his company to say that a requirement had low priority.
        Therefore, the priority categories they adopted were “high,”
        “super-high,” and “incredibly high.” Another developer who was filling
        the BA role claimed that priorities weren’t necessary: if he wrote
        something in the SRS, he intended to build it. That doesn’t address
        the issue of <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">when</em></span> each piece of functionality
        gets built, though.</p><p class="calibre3">I recently visited one company that had great difficulty getting
        their projects done on time. Although management claimed that there
        would be multiple releases of applications so lower-priority
        requirements could wait, in reality each project delivered just a
        single release. Consequently, the stakeholders all knew that they only
        had one shot to get all the functionality they needed. Every
        requirement, therefore, became high priority, overloading the team’s
        capacity to deliver.</p><p class="calibre3">In reality, some system capabilities are more essential than
        others from the perspective of satisfying business objectives. This
        becomes apparent during the all-too-common “rapid descoping phase”
        late in the project, when nonessential features are jettisoned to
        ensure that the critical capabilities ship on schedule. At that point,
        people are clearly making priority decisions, but in a panicked state.
        Setting priorities early in the project and reassessing them in
        response to changing customer preferences, market conditions, and
        business events lets the team spend time wisely on high-value
        activities. Implementing most of a feature before you conclude that it
        isn’t necessary is wasteful and frustrating.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-902" class="calibre"></a>If left to their own devices, customers will establish
        perhaps 85 percent of the requirements as high priority, 10 percent as
        medium, and 5 percent as low. This doesn’t give the project manager
        much flexibility. If all requirements truly are of top priority, your
        project has a high risk of not being fully successful. Scrub the
        requirements to eliminate any that aren’t essential and to simplify
        those that are unnecessarily complex. One study found that nearly
        two-thirds of the features developed in software systems are rarely or
        never used (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-306">[ref225]</a>). To encourage customers to
        acknowledge that some requirements have lower priority, the analyst
        can ask questions such as the following:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Is there some other way to satisfy the need that this

        interrelationships among requirements and their alignment with the
        project’s business objectives. The management team on one large
        commercial project displayed impatience over the analyst’s insistence
        on prioritizing the requirements. The managers pointed out that often
        they can do without a particular feature but that another feature
        might need to be beefed up to compensate. If they deferred too many
        requirements, the resulting product wouldn’t achieve the projected
        revenue.</p><p class="calibre3">Conflicts arise among stakeholders who are convinced that
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">their</em></span> requirements are the most important. As a

        requirement priorities informally. Large or contentious projects with
        many stakeholders demand a more structured approach that removes some
        of the emotion, politics, and guesswork from the process. Several
        analytical and mathematical techniques have been proposed to assist
        with requirements prioritization. These methods involve estimating the
        relative value and relative cost of each requirement. The highest
        priority requirements are those that provide the largest fraction of
        the total product value at the smallest fraction of the total cost
        (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-307">[ref135]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-308">[ref134]</a>). This section
        discusses several techniques people use for prioritizing requirements.

          of stakeholders work down a list of requirements and make a binary
          decision: is it in, or is it out? Keep referring to the project’s
          business objectives to make this judgment, paring the list down to
          the bare minimum needed for the first release. Then, when
          implementation of that release is under way, you can go back to the
          previously “out” requirements and go through the process again for
          the next release.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3079" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Pop goes the requirement</div><p class="calibre3">I once facilitated a workshop that had six stakeholders in
            the room and four more on the phone. We had 400 requirements to
            prioritize. We opted to decide simply if each was in or out, then
            figured we’d deal with the “out” ones for the next release. We
            blocked off several hours in this room to grind through the list.
            One executive stakeholder had the final prioritization decision
            when there were conflicts. Shortly into this meeting, he realized
            that the day was going to be long and monotonous. He decided to
            have some fun. Every time the team cut a requirement, he made an
            explosion sound, like blowing up the requirement. It was a fun way
            to cut scope.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Pairwise comparison and rank ordering"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3080">Pairwise comparison and rank ordering</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">People sometimes try to assign a unique priority sequence
          number to each requirement. Rank ordering a list of requirements
          involves making pairwise comparisons between all of them so you can
          judge which member of each pair has higher priority. <a class="xref" title="Figure 14-1. Sample quality attribute prioritization for an airport check-in kiosk." href="#calibre_link-270">Figure&nbsp;14-1</a> in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 14. Beyond functionality" href="#calibre_link-40">Chapter&nbsp;14</a> illustrated the use of a
          spreadsheet to perform just such a pairwise comparison of quality
          attributes; the same strategy could be applied to a set of features,
          user stories, or any other set of requirements of the same type.
          Performing such comparisons becomes unwieldy for more than a couple
          of dozen requirements. It could work at the granularity level of
          features, but not for all the functional requirements for a system
          as a whole.</p><p class="calibre3">In reality, rank ordering all of the requirements by priority
          is overkill. You won’t be implementing all of these in individual
          releases; instead, you’ll group them together in batches by release
          or development timebox. Grouping requirements into features, or into
          small sets of requirements that have similar priority or that
          otherwise must be implemented together, is sufficient.</p></div><div class="book" title="Three-level scale"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3081">Three-level scale</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1300" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1689" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2304" class="calibre"></a>A common prioritization approach groups requirements
          into three categories. No matter how you label them, if you’re using
          three categories they boil down to high, medium, and low priority.
          Such prioritization scales are subjective and imprecise. To make the
          scale useful, the stakeholders must agree on what each level means
          in the scale they use.</p><p class="calibre3">One way to assess priority is to consider the two dimensions
          of <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">importance</em></span> and <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">urgency</em></span>
          (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-309">[ref051]</a>). Every requirement can be considered as
          being either important to achieving business objectives or not so
          important, and as being either urgent or not so urgent. This is a
          relative assessment among a set of requirements, not an absolute
          binary distinction. As <a class="xref" title="Figure 16-1. Requirements prioritization based on importance and urgency." href="#calibre_link-310">Figure&nbsp;16-1</a> shows, these
          alternatives yield four possible combinations, which you can use to
          define a priority scale:</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-310" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3082" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000067.jpeg" alt="Requirements prioritization based on importance and urgency." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;16-1.&nbsp;Requirements prioritization based on importance and

              need it in the next release). Alternatively, contractual or
              compliance obligations might dictate that a specific requirement
              must be included, or there might be compelling business reasons
              to implement it promptly. If you can wait to implement a
              requirement in a later release without adverse consequences,
              then it is not high priority per this definition.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Medium-priority</em></span> requirements are

              waste your time working on these, because they don’t add

          the requirement in the user requirements documents, the SRS, or the

          inherited by all its subordinate requirements or whether every
          individual functional requirement is to have its own priority
          attribute.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1565" class="calibre"></a>Sometimes, particularly on a large project, you might

          that they all really <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">must</em></span> be delivered in the

          high-priority ones into three groups. You could call them high,
          higher, and highest if you like, so people don’t lose sight of the
          fact that they were originally designated as being important. The
          requirements rated “highest” become your new group of top-priority
          requirements. Group the “high” and “higher” requirements in with
          your original medium-priority group (<a class="xref" title="Figure 16-2. Multipass prioritization keeps the focus on a manageable set of top-priority requirements." href="#calibre_link-311">Figure&nbsp;16-2</a>). Taking a
          hard line on the criterion of “must be in the next release or that

          high-priority capabilities.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-311" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3083" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000068.jpeg" alt="Multipass prioritization keeps the focus on a manageable set of top-priority requirements." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;16-2.&nbsp;Multipass prioritization keeps the focus on a manageable

          rationale for making the decision about how to rate the priority of
          a given requirement compared to others. MoSCoW is ambiguous as to
          timing, particularly when it comes to the “Won’t” rating. “Won’t”
          could mean either “not in the next release” or “not ever.” Such
          distinctions must be made clear so that all stakeholders share a
          common understanding of the implications of a particular priority
          rating. The three-level scale described previously, which relies on
          analysis of the two dimensions of importance and urgency, and
          focuses specifically on the forthcoming release or development
          timebox, is a crisper way to think about priorities. We don’t

            out to never submit something that does not have an ‘M’ associated
            with it. Do they understand the nuanced differences between S, C,
            and W? I have no idea. But they have figured out the implications
            of these rankings. They treat them all the same and understand

          resources to achieve the maximum benefit from the investment an
          organization makes in a project. One way to make prioritization more
          tangible is to cast it in terms of an actual resource: money. In
          this case, it’s just play money, but money nonetheless.</p><p class="calibre3">Give the prioritization team 100 imaginary dollars to work
          with. Team members allocate these dollars to “buy” items that they
          would like to have implemented from the complete set of candidate
          requirements. They weight the higher-priority requirements more
          heavily by allocating more dollars to them. If one requirement is
          three times as important to a stakeholder as another requirement,
          she would assign perhaps nine dollars to the first requirement and
          three dollars to the second. But 100 dollars is all the prioritizers
          get&mdash;when they are out of money, nothing else can be implemented, at
          least not in the release they are currently focusing on. One
          approach is to have different participants in the prioritization
          process perform their own dollar allocations, then add up the total
          number of dollars assigned to each requirement to see which ones
          collectively come out as having the highest priority.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-655" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-816" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-903" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1684" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1685" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-3087" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1882" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2051" class="calibre"></a>The hundred-dollar approach is not a bad way to get a

          priority. However, <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-23">[ref056]</a> points out several ways
          that participants can “game” the process to skew the results. For
          instance, if you really, REALLY want a particular requirement, you
          might give it all 100 of your dollars to try to float it to the top
          of the list. In reality, you’d never accept a system that possessed
          just that single requirement, though. Nor does this scheme take into
          account any concern about the relative amount of effort needed to
          implement each of those requirements. If you could get three
          requirements each valued at $10 for the same effort as one valued at
          $15, you’re likely better off with the three. The scheme is based
          solely on the perceived value of certain requirements to a
          particular set of stakeholders, a limitation of many prioritization
          techniques.</p><p class="calibre3">Another prioritization technique is based on real money, not

          chain</em></span> technique, you assign an estimated dollar value
          that represents how much each proposed feature contributes to

          the relative value of features to one another and select which ones

        through the other relatively informal techniques, it might be useful
        to apply a more analytical method. A definitive, rigorous way to
        relate customer value to proposed product features is with a technique
        called Quality Function Deployment, or QFD (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-312">[ref042]</a>). Few software organizations seem to be willing to
        undertake the rigor of QFD, although a structured prioritization
        method adapted from QFD has proven to be helpful.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Table 16-1. Sample prioritization matrix for the Chemical Tracking System" href="#calibre_link-313">Table&nbsp;16-1</a>
        illustrates a spreadsheet model to help estimate the relative
        priorities for a set of requirements. This technique was ranked in the
        top tier of effectiveness in a comparative evaluation of 17
        requirements prioritization methods (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-314">[ref145]</a>). The
        Microsoft Excel spreadsheet is available in the companion content for
        this book. The example in <a class="xref" title="Table 16-1. Sample prioritization matrix for the Chemical Tracking System" href="#calibre_link-313">Table&nbsp;16-1</a> lists several
        features from (what else?) the Chemical Tracking System. This scheme
        borrows from the QFD concept of basing customer value on both the
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">benefit</em></span> provided to the customer if a specific
        product feature is present and the <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">penalty</em></span> paid
        if that feature is absent (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-315">[ref181]</a>). A feature’s
        attractiveness is directly proportional to the value it provides and
        inversely proportional to its <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">cost</em></span> and the
        technical <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">risk</em></span> associated with implementing it.
        All other things being equal, those features with the highest
        risk-adjusted value/cost ratio should have the highest priority. This

        those that aren’t obviously top priority. For instance, you wouldn’t
        include in this analysis items that implement the product’s core
        business functions, key product differentiators, or items required for
        regulatory compliance. After you’ve identified those features that
        absolutely must be included for the product to be releasable, use the
        model in <a class="xref" title="Table 16-1. Sample prioritization matrix for the Chemical Tracking System" href="#calibre_link-313">Table&nbsp;16-1</a>
        to scale the relative priorities of the remaining capabilities.
        Typical participants in the prioritization process include:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The project manager or business analyst, who leads the

            ratings.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1301" class="calibre"></a>Follow these steps to use this prioritization model
        (it’s more complicated to explain than to use):</p><div class="book"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1"><p class="calibre3">List in the spreadsheet all the features, use cases, use
            case flows, user stories, or functional requirements that you want
            to prioritize against each other. We’ve used features in the
            example. All the items must be at the same level of
            abstraction&mdash;don’t mix functional requirements with features, use
            cases, or user stories. Certain features might be logically linked
            (you’d implement feature B only if feature A were included) or
            have dependencies (feature A must be implemented before feature
            B). For those, include only the driving feature in the analysis.
            This model will work with up to several dozen items before it
            becomes unwieldy. If you have more than that, group related items
            together to create a manageable list. You can apply the method
            hierarchically. After you perform an initial prioritization on,
            for example, features, you can apply it again within a feature to
            prioritize its individual subfeatures or functional
            requirements.</p></li><li class="listitem" value="2"><p class="calibre3">Have the customer representatives estimate the relative

            business on a scale of 1 to 9. A rating of 1 indicates that no one
            would find it useful; 9 means that it would be extremely valuable.
            These benefit ratings indicate alignment of the features with the
            product’s business objectives.</p></li><li class="listitem" value="3"><p class="calibre3">Estimate the relative penalty that the customer or the
            business would suffer if each feature were

            rating of 1 means that no one will be upset if it’s absent; 9
            indicates a serious downside. Requirements with both a low benefit
            and a low penalty add cost but little value. Sometimes a feature
            could have a fairly low value, if not many customers will use it,
            but a high penalty if your competitor’s product boasts that
            feature and the customers expect it to be there&mdash;even if they don’t
            personally plan to use it! Marketing people sometimes call these
            “checkbox features”: you need to say you have it, even if few
            people really care. When assigning penalty ratings, consider what
            might happen if you do not include the capability:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Would your product suffer in comparison with other

                an enhancement?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Would problems arise because marketing promised a
                feature to some customers?</p></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem" value="4"><p class="calibre3">The spreadsheet calculates the total value for each feature
            as the sum of its benefit and penalty scores (weighted as
            described later in the chapter). The spreadsheet sums the values
            for all the features and calculates the percentage of the total
            value that comes from each of the features (the Value % column).
            Note that this is not the percentage of total value for the entire
            product, just for the set of features you’re prioritizing against
            each other here.</p></li><li class="listitem" value="5"><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2052" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2208" class="calibre"></a>Have developers estimate the relative cost of
            implementing each feature, again on a scale of 1 (quick and easy)
            to 9 (time-consuming and expensive). The spreadsheet will
            calculate the percentage of the total cost that each feature
            contributes. Developers estimate the cost ratings based on the
            feature’s complexity, the extent of user interface work required,
            the potential ability to reuse existing code, the amount of
            testing needed, and so forth. Agile teams could base these cost
            ratings on the number of story points they’ve assigned to each
            user story. (See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 19. Beyond requirements development" href="#calibre_link-94">Chapter&nbsp;19</a> for more about
            estimation on agile projects.)</p></li><li class="listitem" value="6"><p class="calibre3">Similarly, have developers rate the relative technical (not
            business) risk associated with each feature on a scale of 1 to 9.
            Technical risk is the probability of <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">not</em></span>
            getting the feature right on the first try. A rating of 1 means
            you can program it in your sleep. A 9 indicates serious concerns
            about feasibility, the lack of necessary expertise on the team,
            the use of unfamiliar tools and technologies, or concern about the
            amount of complexity hidden within the requirement. The
            spreadsheet will calculate the percentage of the total risk that
            comes from each feature.</p></li><li class="listitem" value="7"><p class="calibre3">After you’ve entered all the estimates into the spreadsheet,
            it will calculate a priority value for each feature by using the
            following formula:</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="calibre_link-3089" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3090" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000069.gif" alt="image with no caption" class="calibre17" /></div></div></li><li class="listitem" value="8"><p class="calibre3">Finally, sort the list of features in descending order by
            calculated priority, the rightmost column. The features at the top
            of the list have the most favorable balance of value, cost, and
            risk and thus&mdash;all other factors being equal&mdash;should have highest
            priority. Discussions that focus on those features at the top of
            the list will let you refine that preliminary ranking into a
            priority sequence that stakeholders can agree on, even if not
            everyone gets exactly what they want.</p></li></ol></div><p class="calibre3">By default, the benefit, penalty, cost, and risk terms are
        weighted equally. You can change the relative weights for the four
        factors in the top row of the spreadsheet, to reflect the thought
        process by which your team makes priority decisions. In <a class="xref" title="Table 16-1. Sample prioritization matrix for the Chemical Tracking System" href="#calibre_link-313">Table&nbsp;16-1</a>, all benefit
        ratings are weighted twice as heavily as the corresponding penalty
        ratings, penalty and cost are weighted the same, and risk has half the
        weight of the cost and penalty terms. To drop a term out of the model,
        set its weight to zero.</p><p class="calibre3">When using this spreadsheet model with prioritization
        participants, you might want to hide certain columns that appear in
        <a class="xref" title="Table 16-1. Sample prioritization matrix for the Chemical Tracking System" href="#calibre_link-313">Table&nbsp;16-1</a>: Total
        value, Value %, Cost %, and Risk %. These show intermediate results
        from the calculations that could just be a distraction. Hiding them
        will let the customers focus on the four rating categories and the
        calculated priority values.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3091" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Or, we could arm wrestle</div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2062" class="calibre"></a>One company that introduced a requirements
          prioritization procedure based on this spreadsheet found that it
          helped a project team to break through an impasse. Several
          stakeholders had different opinions about which features were most
          important on a large project; the team was deadlocked. The
          spreadsheet analysis made the priority assessment more objective and
          less emotionally charged, enabling the team to agree on some
          conclusions and move ahead.</p><p class="calibre3">Consultant <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-316">[ref206]</a> reported that, “I have
          suggested this spreadsheet to my clients as a tool for
          decision-making. Although the ones who tried it have never
          completely filled out the spreadsheet, they found the discussion it
          stimulated extremely helpful in deciding the relative priorities of
          the different requirements.” That is, you can use the framework of
          benefit, penalty, cost, and risk to guide discussions about
          priorities. This is more valuable than working completely through
          the spreadsheet analysis and relying exclusively on the calculated
          priority sequence. Because requirements and their priorities can
          change with time, use the spreadsheet tool throughout the project to
          help manage the backlog of work remaining to be done.</p></div><p class="calibre3">This priority model’s usefulness is limited by the team’s
        ability to estimate the benefit, penalty, cost, and risk for each
        item. Therefore, use the calculated priorities only as a guideline.
        Stakeholders should review the completed spreadsheet to agree on the
        ratings and the resulting sorted priority sequence. If you aren’t sure
        whether you can trust the results, consider calibrating this model for
        your own use with a set of implemented requirements from a previous
        project. Adjust the weighting factors until the calculated priority
        sequence correlates well with your after-the-fact evaluation of how
        important the requirements in your calibration set really were. This
        will give you some confidence in using the tool as a predictive model
        of how you make priority decisions on your projects.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3092" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Don’t over-interpret small differences in calculated priority

        relative benefit of a specific requirement or the penalty of omitting
        it. The prioritization spreadsheet includes a variant that
        accommodates input from several user classes or other stakeholder
        groups. In the Multiple Stakeholders worksheet tab in the downloadable
        spreadsheet, duplicate the Relative Benefit and Relative Penalty
        columns so that you have a set for each stakeholder who’s contributing
        to the analysis. Then assign a weighting factor to each stakeholder,
        giving higher weights to favored user classes than to groups who have
        less influence on the project’s decisions. Have each stakeholder
        representative provide his own benefit and penalty ratings for each
        feature. The spreadsheet will incorporate the stakeholder weights when
        it calculates the final value scores.</p><p class="calibre3">This model can also help you to make trade-off decisions when
        you’re evaluating proposed requirements additions. Add the new
        requirements to the prioritization spreadsheet and see how their
        priorities align with those of the existing requirements baseline so
        you can choose an appropriate implementation sequence.</p><p class="calibre3">You don’t always need to use a method this elaborate. Keep your
        prioritization process as simple as possible, but no simpler. Strive
        to move prioritization away from the political and emotional arena
        into a forum in which stakeholders can make honest assessments. This
        will give you a better chance of building products that deliver the
        maximum business value with the minimum cost.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3093" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Next steps</div><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Reevaluate the requirements in your backlog for an

      inspection meeting whose participants were carefully examining a
      software requirements specification for problems. The meeting included
      representatives from two user classes, a developer named Jeremy, and
      Trish, the business analyst who wrote the SRS. One requirement stated,
      “The system shall provide unattended terminal timeout security of
      workstations accessing the training system.” Jeremy presented his
      interpretation of this requirement to the rest of the group. “This
      requirement says the system will automatically log off the current user
      of any workstation logged into the training system if there hasn’t been
      any activity within a certain period of time.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Hui-Lee, one of the product champions, chimed in. “How
      does the system determine that the terminal is unattended? Is it like a
      screen saver, so if there isn’t any mouse or keyboard activity for
      several minutes, it logs the user off? That could be annoying if the
      user was just talking to someone briefly.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Trish added, “The requirement doesn’t say anything about
      logging off the user. I assumed that timeout security meant a logoff,
      but maybe the user just has to retype her password to keep
      going.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Jeremy was confused also. “Does this mean any
      workstation that can connect to the training system, or just
      workstations that are actively logged into the system at the moment? How
      long of a timeout period are we talking about? Maybe there’s a security
      guideline for this kind of thing.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Barry made sure that the inspection recorder had
      captured all these concerns accurately. He followed up with Trish after
      the meeting to ensure that she understood all of the issues so she could
      resolve them.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">Most software developers have experienced the frustration of being
      presented with requirements that were ambiguous or incomplete. If they
      can’t get the information they need, the developers have to make their
      own interpretations, which aren’t always correct. As you saw in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 1. The essential software requirement" href="#calibre_link-21">Chapter&nbsp;1</a> it costs far more to
      correct a requirement error after implementation than to correct one
      found during requirements development. One study found that it took an
      average of 30 minutes to fix a defect discovered during the requirements
      phase. In contrast, 5 to 17 hours were needed to correct a defect
      identified during system testing (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-318">[ref138]</a>). Clearly,
      any measures you can take to detect errors in the requirements
      specifications will save time and money.</p><p class="calibre3">On many projects, testing is a late-stage activity.
      Requirements-related problems linger in the product until they’re
      finally revealed through time-consuming system testing or&mdash;worse&mdash;by the
      end user. If you start your test planning and test-case development in
      parallel with requirements development, you’ll detect many errors
      shortly after they’re introduced. This prevents them from doing further
      damage and minimizes your development and maintenance costs.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-538" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1258" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1459" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2489" class="calibre"></a><a class="xref" title="Figure 17-1. The V model of software development incorporates early test planning and test design." href="#calibre_link-319">Figure&nbsp;17-1</a> illustrates the V

      parallel with the corresponding development activities. This model
      indicates that acceptance tests are derived from the user requirements,
      system tests are based on the functional requirements, and integration
      tests are based on the system’s architecture. This model is applicable
      whether the software development activities being tested are for the
      product as a whole, a particular release, or a single development
      increment.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-319" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3095" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000070.jpeg" alt="An illustration showing a v-shaped figure with text paired             up on the left and right sides.

        planning and test design.</div></div><p class="calibre3">As we will discuss later in the chapter, you can use the tests to
      validate each of these requirement types during requirements
      development. You can’t actually execute any tests during requirements
      development because you don’t have any running software yet. However,
      conceptual (that is, implementation-independent) tests based on the
      requirements will reveal errors, ambiguities, and omissions in your
      requirements and models before the team writes any code.</p><p class="calibre3">Project participants sometimes are reluctant to spend time
      reviewing and testing requirements. Their intuition tells them that
      inserting time into the schedule to improve requirements quality would
      delay the planned ship date by that same duration. However, this
      expectation assumes a zero return on your investment in requirements
      validation. In reality, that investment can actually
      <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">shorten</em></span> the delivery schedule by reducing the
      rework required and by accelerating system integration and testing
      (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-320">[ref018]</a>). Better requirements lead to higher product
      quality and customer satisfaction, which reduce the product’s lifetime
      costs for maintenance, enhancement, and customer support. Investing in
      requirements quality usually saves you much more than you spend.</p><p class="calibre3">Various techniques can help you to evaluate the correctness and
      quality of your requirements (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-321">[ref237]</a>). One approach
      is to quantify each requirement so that you can think of a way to
      measure how well a proposed solution satisfies it. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-206">[ref201]</a> use the term <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">fit criteria</em></span> to
      describe such quantifications. This chapter addresses the validation
      techniques of formal and informal requirements reviews, developing tests
      from requirements, and having customers define their acceptance criteria
      for the product.</p><div class="book" title="Validation and verification"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3096">Validation and verification</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2494" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2516" class="calibre"></a>Requirements validation is the fourth component of
        requirements development, along with elicitation, analysis, and
        specification. Some authors use the term “verification” for this step.
        In this book, we’ve adopted the terminology of the <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Software
        Engineering Body of Knowledge</em></span> (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-46">[ref001]</a>)
        and refer to this aspect of requirements development as “validation.”
        Verifying requirements to ensure that they have all the desired
        properties of high-quality requirements is also an essential activity.
        Precisely speaking, validation and verification are two different
        activities in software development. <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Verification</em></span>
        determines whether the product of some development activity meets its
        requirements (doing the thing right). <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Validation</em></span>
        assesses whether a product satisfies customer needs (doing the right
        thing).</p><p class="calibre3">Extending these definitions to requirements, verification
        determines whether you have written the requirements right: your
        requirements have the desirable properties described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 11. Writing excellent requirements" href="#calibre_link-59">Chapter&nbsp;11</a>. Validation of
        requirements assesses whether you have written the right requirements:
        they trace back to business objectives. These two concepts are closely
        intertwined. For simplicity in this chapter, we talk about validating
        the requirements, but the techniques we describe contribute both to
        having the correct requirements and to having high-quality
        requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">Validating requirements allows teams to build a correct solution
        that meets the stated business objectives. Requirements validation
        activities attempt to ensure that:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The software requirements accurately describe the intended
            system capabilities and properties that will satisfy the various
            stakeholders’ needs.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The software requirements are correctly derived from the
            business requirements, system requirements, business rules, and
            other sources.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The requirements are complete, feasible, and
            verifiable.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">All requirements are necessary, and the entire set is
            sufficient to meet the business objectives.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">All requirements representations are consistent with each
            other.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The requirements provide an adequate basis to proceed with
            design and construction.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Validation isn’t a single discrete phase that you perform after
        eliciting and documenting all the requirements. Some validation
        activities, such as incremental reviews of the growing requirements
        set, are threaded throughout the iterative elicitation, analysis, and
        specification processes. Other activities, such as formal inspections,
        provide a final quality gate prior to baselining a set of
        requirements. Include requirements validation activities as tasks in
        your project plan. Of course, you can validate only requirements that
        have been documented, not implicit requirements that exist only in
        someone’s mind.</p></div><div class="book" title="Reviewing requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3097">Reviewing requirements</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1380" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1381" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1633" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1634" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1641" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-3098" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2498" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2502" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2509" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2549" class="calibre"></a>Anytime someone other than the author of a work product
        examines the product for problems, a <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">peer review</em></span>
        is taking place. Reviewing requirements is a powerful technique for
        identifying ambiguous or unverifiable requirements, requirements that
        aren’t defined clearly enough for design to begin, and other
        problems.</p><p class="calibre3">Different kinds of peer reviews go by a variety of names (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-54">[ref245]</a>). Informal reviews are useful for educating other
        people about the product and collecting unstructured feedback.
        However, they are not systematic, thorough, or performed in a
        consistent way. Informal review approaches include:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">A <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">peer deskcheck</em></span>, in which you ask one
            colleague to look over your work product.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">A <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">passaround</em></span>, in which you invite
            several colleagues to examine a deliverable concurrently.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">A <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">walkthrough</em></span>, during which the author
            describes a deliverable and solicits comments on it.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Informal reviews are good for catching glaring errors,
        inconsistencies, and gaps. They can help you spot statements that
        don’t meet the characteristics of high-quality requirements. But it’s
        hard for a reviewer to catch all of the ambiguous requirements on his
        own. He might read a requirement and think he understands it, moving
        on to the next without a second thought. Another reviewer might read
        the same requirement, arrive at a different interpretation, and also
        not think there is an issue. If these two reviewers never discuss the
        requirement, the ambiguity will go unnoticed until later in the
        project.</p><p class="calibre3">Formal peer reviews follow a well-defined process. A formal
        requirements review produces a report that identifies the material
        examined, the reviewers, and the review team’s judgment as to whether
        the requirements are acceptable. The principal deliverable is a
        summary of the defects found and the issues raised during the review.
        The members of a formal review team share responsibility for the
        quality of the review, although authors ultimately are responsible for
        the quality of the deliverables they create.</p><p class="calibre3">The best-established type of formal peer review is called an
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">inspection</em></span>. Inspection of requirements documents
        is one of the highest-leverage software quality techniques available.
        Several companies have avoided as many as 10 hours of labor for every
        hour they invested in inspecting requirements documents and other
        software deliverables (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-322">[ref097]</a>). A 1,000 percent
        return on investment is not to be sneezed at.</p><p class="calibre3">If you’re serious about maximizing the quality of your software,
        your teams will inspect most of their requirements. Detailed
        inspection of large requirements sets is tedious and time consuming.
        Nonetheless, the teams I know who have adopted requirements
        inspections agree that every minute they spent was worthwhile. If you
        don’t have time to inspect everything, use risk analysis to
        differentiate those requirements that demand inspection from less
        critical, less complex, or less novel material for which an informal
        review will suffice. Inspections are not cheap. They’re not even that
        much fun. But they are cheaper&mdash;and more fun&mdash;than the alternative of
        expending lots of effort and customer goodwill fixing problems found
        much later on.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3099" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">The closer you look, the more you see</div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1218" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-3100" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1327" class="calibre"></a>On the Chemical Tracking System project, the user
          representatives informally reviewed their latest contribution to the

          BAs combined the input from all user classes into a single SRS of
          about 50 pages plus several appendices. Two BAs, one developer,
          three product champions, and one tester then inspected this full SRS
          in three two-hour inspection meetings held over the course of a
          week. The inspectors found 223 additional errors, including dozens
          of major defects. All the inspectors agreed that the time they spent
          grinding through the SRS, one requirement at a time, saved the
          project team countless more hours in the long run.</p></div><div class="book" title="The inspection process"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3101">The inspection process</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Michael Fagan developed the inspection process at IBM (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-323">[ref070]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-324">[ref195]</a>), and others have

          industry best practice (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-212">[ref032]</a>). Any software

          defects and improvement opportunities. Inspections serve as a
          quality gate through which project deliverables must pass before
          they are baselined. There are several forms of inspection, but any
          one of them is a powerful quality technique. The following

            might mean that some perspectives won’t be represented in every
            inspection. Large teams easily get bogged down in side
            discussions, problem solving, and debates over whether something
            is really an error. This reduces the rate at which they cover the
            material during the inspection and increases the cost of finding

            the project and his presence is acceptable to the author. An
            effective inspection that reveals many defects might create a bad
            impression of the author to a hypercritical manager. Also, the
            manager’s presence might stifle discussion from other
            participants.</p></div><div class="book" title="Inspection roles"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-3103">Inspection roles</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">All participants in an inspection, including the author,
            look for defects and improvement opportunities. Some of the
            inspection team members perform the following specific roles
            during the inspection (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-54">[ref245]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Author</strong></span> The author created
            or maintains the work product being inspected. The author of a
            requirements document is usually the business analyst who elicited
            customer needs and wrote the requirements. During informal reviews
            such as walkthroughs, the author often leads the discussion.
            However, the author takes a more passive role during an
            inspection. The author should not assume any of the other assigned
            roles&mdash;moderator, reader, or recorder. By not having an active
            role, the author can listen to the comments from other inspectors,
            respond to&mdash;but not debate&mdash;their questions, and think. This way the
            author can often spot errors that other inspectors don’t
            see.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Moderator</strong></span> The moderator
            plans the inspection with the author, coordinates the activities,
            and facilitates the inspection meeting. The moderator distributes
            the materials to be inspected, along with any relevant predecessor
            documents, to the participants a few days before the inspection
            meeting. Moderator responsibilities include starting the meeting
            on time, encouraging contributions from all participants, and
            keeping the meeting focused on finding major defects rather than
            resolving problems or being distracted by minor stylistic issues
            and typos. The moderator follows up on proposed changes with the
            author to ensure that the issues that came out of the inspection
            were addressed properly.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1155" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1889" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1899" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Reader</strong></span> One
            inspector is assigned the role of reader. During the inspection
            meeting, the reader paraphrases the requirements and model
            elements being examined one at a time. The other participants then
            point out potential defects and issues that they see. By stating a
            requirement in her own words, the reader provides an
            interpretation that might differ from that held by other
            inspectors. This is a good way to reveal an ambiguity, a possible
            defect, or an assumption. It also underscores the value of having
            someone other than the author serve as the reader. In less formal
            types of peer reviews, the reader role is omitted, with the
            moderator walking the team through the work product and soliciting
            comments on one section at a time.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Recorder</strong></span> The recorder
            uses standard forms to document the issues raised and the defects
            found during the meeting. The recorder should review aloud or
            visually share (by projecting or sharing in a web conference) what
            he wrote to confirm its accuracy. The other inspectors should help
            the recorder capture the essence of each issue in a way that
            clearly communicates to the author the location and nature of the
            issue so he can address it efficiently and correctly.</p></div><div class="book" title="Entry criteria"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-3104">Entry criteria</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">You’re ready to inspect a requirements document when it

            author and moderator plan the inspection together. They determine
            who should participate, what materials the inspectors should
            receive prior to the inspection meeting, the total meeting time
            needed to cover the material, and when the inspection should be
            scheduled. The number of pages reviewed per hour has a large
            impact on how many defects are found (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-325">[ref088]</a>).
            As <a class="xref" title="Figure 17-3. The number of defects found depends on the inspection rate." href="#calibre_link-327">Figure&nbsp;17-3</a>
            shows, proceeding through a requirements document slowly reveals
            the most defects. (An alternative interpretation of this
            frequently reported relationship is that the inspection slows down
            if you encounter a lot of defects. It’s not totally clear which is
            cause and which is effect.) Because no team has infinite time
            available for requirements inspections, select an appropriate
            inspection rate based on the risk of overlooking major defects.
            Two to four pages per hour is a practical guideline, although the
            optimum rate for maximum defect-detection effectiveness is about
            half that rate (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-325">[ref088]</a>). Adjust this rate based
            on the following factors:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The team’s previous inspection data, showing inspection
                effectiveness as a function of rate</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The amount of text on each page</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The complexity of the requirements</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The likelihood and impact of having errors remain

            inspection meeting, the author should share background information
            with inspectors so they understand the context of the items being
            inspected and know the author’s objectives for the inspection.
            Each inspector then examines the product to identify possible
            defects and issues, using the checklist of typical requirements
            defects described later in this chapter or other analysis
            techniques (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-54">[ref245]</a>). Up to 75 percent of the
            defects found by an inspection are discovered during preparation,
            so don’t omit this step (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-328">[ref112]</a>). The
            techniques described in the <a class="xref" title="Finding missing requirements" href="#calibre_link-329">Finding missing requirements</a> section in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 7. Requirements elicitation" href="#calibre_link-31">Chapter&nbsp;7</a> can be helpful during
            preparation. Plan on spending at least half as much time on

            an inspection meeting, the reader leads the other inspectors
            through the document, describing one requirement at a time in his
            own words. As inspectors bring up possible defects and other
            issues, the recorder captures them in the action item list for the
            requirements author. The purpose of the meeting is to identify as
            many major defects as possible. The inspection meeting shouldn’t
            last more than about two hours; tired people aren’t effective
            inspectors. If you need more time to cover all the material,
            schedule additional meetings.</p><p class="calibre3">After examining all the material, the team decides whether
            to accept the requirements document as is, accept it with minor
            revisions, or indicate that major revision is needed. An outcome
            of “major revision needed” could suggest that the requirements
            development process has some shortcomings or that the BA who wrote
            the requirements needs additional training. Consider holding a
            retrospective to explore how the process can be improved prior to
            the next specification activity (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-96">[ref139]</a>). If
            major revisions are necessary, the team might elect to re-examine
            portions of the product that require extensive rework, as shown by
            the dotted line between Rework and Preparation in <a class="xref" title="Figure 17-2. Inspection is a multistep process.

            issues. In addition, inspectors are easily sidetracked into
            discussing whether an issue really is a defect, debating questions
            of project scope, and brainstorming solutions to problems. These
            activities can be useful, but they distract attention from the
            core objective of finding significant defects and improvement
            opportunities.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-669" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-813" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-988" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1190" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1360" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1561" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1636" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1994" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2493" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Rework</strong></span> Nearly
            every quality control activity reveals some defects. The author

            following the inspection meeting. Uncorrected requirement defects
            will be expensive to fix down the road, so this is the time to
            resolve the ambiguities, eliminate the fuzziness, and lay the

            the inspection process and enables the moderator to determine
            whether the inspection’s exit criteria have been satisfied. The
            follow-up step might reveal that some of the modifications made

          Issues and Practical Advice</em></span> (Microsoft Press, 2006)
          offers suggestions to improve your requirements reviews. The
          following tips apply whether you are performing informal or formal
          reviews on your projects, and whether you’re storing your

          tool, or in any other tangible form.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Plan the examination</strong></span> When
          someone asks you to review a document, the temptation is to begin at
          the top of page one and read it straight through. But you don’t need
          to do that. The consumers of the requirements specification won’t be
          reading it front-to-back like a book; reviewers don’t have to,
          either. Invite certain reviewers to focus on specific sections of
          documents.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1635" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Start early</strong></span> Begin
          reviewing sets of requirements when they are perhaps only 10 percent
          complete, not when you think they’re “done.” Detecting major defects
          early and spotting systemic problems in the way the requirements are
          being written is a powerful way to prevent&mdash;not just
          find&mdash;defects.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Allocate sufficient time</strong></span>
          Give reviewers sufficient time to perform the reviews, both in terms
          of actual hours to review (effort) and calendar time. They have
          other important tasks that the review has to fit around.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Provide context</strong></span> Give
          reviewers context for the document and perhaps for the project if
          they are not all working on the same project. Seek out reviewers who
          can provide a useful perspective based on their knowledge. For
          example, you might know a co-worker from another project who has a
          good eye for finding major requirement gaps even without being
          intimately familiar with the project.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Set review scope</strong></span> Tell
          reviewers what material to examine, where to focus their attention,
          and what issues to look for. Suggest that they use a defect
          checklist like the one described in the preceding section. You might
          want to maximize availability and skills by asking different
          reviewers to review different sections or to use different parts of
          the checklists.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Limit re-reviews</strong></span> Don’t ask
          anyone to review the same material more than three times. He will be
          tired of looking at it and won’t spot major issues after a third
          cycle because of “reviewer fatigue.” If you do need someone to
          review it multiple times, highlight the changes so he can focus on
          those.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Prioritize review areas</strong></span>
          Prioritize for review those portions of the requirements that are of
          high risk or have functionality that will be used frequently. Also,
          look for areas of the requirements that have few issues logged
          already. It might be the case that those sections have not yet been
          reviewed, not that they are problem-free.</p></div><div class="book" title="Requirements review challenges"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3113">Requirements review challenges</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">A peer review is both a technical activity and a social
          activity. Asking some colleagues to tell you what’s wrong with your
          work is a learned&mdash;not instinctive&mdash;behavior. It takes time for a
          software organization to instill peer reviews into its culture.
          Following are some common challenges that organizations face
          regarding requirements reviews, some of which apply specifically to
          formal inspections, with suggestions for how to address each one
          (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-333">[ref241]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-54">[ref245]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Large requirements
          documents</strong></span> The prospect of thoroughly examining a
          several-hundred-page requirements document is daunting. You might be
          tempted to skip the review entirely and just proceed with
          construction&mdash;not a wise choice. Even given a document of moderate
          size, all reviewers might carefully examine the first part and a few
          stalwarts will study the middle, but it’s unlikely that anyone will
          look at the last part.</p><p class="calibre3">To avoid overwhelming the review team, perform incremental
          reviews throughout requirements development. Identify high-risk
          areas that need a careful look through inspection, and use informal
          reviews for less risky material. Ask particular reviewers to start
          at different locations in the document to make certain that fresh
          eyes have looked at every page. To judge whether you really need to
          inspect the entire specification, examine a representative sample
          (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-325">[ref088]</a>). The number and types of errors you find
          will help you determine whether investing in a full inspection is
          likely to pay off.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Large inspection teams</strong></span> Many
          project participants and customers hold a stake in the requirements,
          so you might have a long list of potential participants for
          requirements inspections. However, large review teams increase the
          cost of the review, make it hard to schedule meetings, and have
          difficulty reaching agreement on issues. I once participated in a
          meeting with 13 other inspectors. Fourteen people cannot agree to
          leave a burning room, let alone agree on whether a particular
          requirement is correct. Try the following approaches to deal with a
          potentially large inspection team:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Make sure every participant is there to find defects, not
              to be educated or to protect a position.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Understand which perspective (such as customer, developer,
              or tester) each inspector represents. Several people who
              represent the same community can pool their input and send just
              one representative to the inspection meeting.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Establish several small teams to inspect the requirements
              in parallel and combine their defect lists, removing any
              duplicates. Research has shown that multiple inspection teams
              find more requirements defects than does a single large group
              (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-334">[ref162]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-335">[ref211]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-336">[ref142]</a>). The results of parallel inspections are
              primarily additive rather than redundant.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Geographically separated
          reviewers</strong></span> Organizations often build products through the
          collaboration of geographically dispersed teams. This makes reviews
          more challenging. Teleconferencing doesn’t reveal the body language
          and expressions of other reviewers like a face-to-face meeting does,
          but videoconferencing can be an effective solution. Web conferencing
          tools allow reviewers to ensure that they are all looking at the
          same material during the discussion.</p><p class="calibre3">Reviews of an electronic document placed in a shared network
          repository provide an alternative to a traditional review meeting.
          In this approach, reviewers use word-processor features to insert
          their comments into the text. (This is how Karl and Joy reviewed
          each other’s work as we were writing this book.) Each comment is
          labeled with the reviewer’s initials, and each reviewer can see what
          previous reviewers had to say. Web-based collaboration tools also
          can help. Some requirements management tools include components to
          facilitate distributed asynchronous reviews that do not involve live
          meetings. If you choose not to hold a meeting, recognize that this
          can reduce a review’s effectiveness, but it’s certainly better than
          not performing the review at all.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Unprepared reviewers</strong></span> One of
          the prerequisites to a formal review meeting is that the
          participants have examined the material being reviewed ahead of
          time, individually identifying their initial sets of issues. Without
          this preparation, you risk people spending the meeting time doing
          all of their thinking on the spot and likely missing many important
          issues.</p><p class="calibre3">One project had a 50-page SRS to be reviewed by 15 people, far
          too many to be effective and efficient. Everyone had one week to
          review the document on their own and send issues back to the author.
          Not surprisingly, most people didn’t look at it at all. So the lead
          BA scheduled a mandatory meeting for the reviewers to review the
          document together. He projected the SRS on the screen, dimmed the
          lights, and began reading through the requirements one by one. (The
          room had one very bright light shining down in the middle, directly
          on the lead BA&mdash;talk about being in the spotlight!) A couple of hours
          into the review meeting, the participants were yawning, their
          attention fading. Not surprisingly, the rate of issue detection
          decreased. Everyone longed for the meeting to end. This BA let the
          participants leave, suggesting that they review the document on
          their own time to speed up the next review meeting. Sure enough,
          being bored during the meeting triggered them to do their prep work.

          keep participants engaged during review meetings.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Prototyping requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3114">Prototyping requirements</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1176" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1501" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1785" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1808" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2281" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2503" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2508" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2511" class="calibre"></a>It’s hard to visualize how a system will function under
        specific circumstances just by reading the requirements. Prototypes
        are validation tools that make the requirements real. They allow the
        user to experience some aspects of what a system based on the
        requirements would be like. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 15. Risk reduction through prototyping" href="#calibre_link-10">Chapter&nbsp;15</a> has more information
        on different types of prototypes and how they improve requirements.
        Here we describe how prototypes can help stakeholders judge whether a
        product built according to the requirements would meet their needs,
        and whether the requirements are complete, feasible, and clearly
        communicated.</p><p class="calibre3">All kinds of prototypes allow you to find missing requirements
        before more expensive activities like development and testing take
        place. Something as simple as a paper mock-up can be used to walk
        through use cases, processes, or functions to detect any omitted or
        erroneous requirements. Prototypes also help confirm that stakeholders
        have a shared understanding of the requirements. Someone might
        implement a prototype based on his understanding of the requirements,
        only to learn that a requirement wasn’t clear when prototype
        evaluators don’t agree with his interpretation.</p><p class="calibre3">Proof-of-concept prototypes can demonstrate that the
        requirements are feasible. Evolutionary prototypes allow the users to
        see how the requirements would work when they are implemented, to
        validate that the result is what they expect. Additional levels of
        sophistication in prototypes, such as simulations, allow more precise
        validation of the requirements; however, building more sophisticated
        prototypes will also take more time.</p></div><div class="book" title="Testing the requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3115">Testing the requirements</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Tests that are based on the functional requirements or derived
        from user requirements help make the expected system behaviors
        tangible to the project participants. The simple act of designing
        tests will reveal many problems with the requirements long before you
        can execute those tests on running software. Writing functional tests
        crystallizes your vision of how the system should behave under certain
        conditions. Vague and ambiguous requirements will jump out at you
        because you won’t be able to describe the expected system response.
        When BAs, developers, and customers walk through tests together,
        they’ll achieve a shared vision of how the product will work and
        increase their confidence that the requirements are correct. Testing
        is a powerful tool for both validating and verifying
        requirements.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3116" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2403" class="calibre"></a>Watch out for testers who claim they can’t begin their
          work until the requirements are done, as well as for testers who
          claim they don’t need requirements to test the software. Testing and
          requirements have a synergistic relationship; they represent
          complementary views of the system.</p></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3117" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Making Charlie happy</div><p class="calibre3">I once asked my group’s UNIX scripting guru, Charlie, to build
          a simple email interface extension for a commercial defect-tracking
          system we had adopted. I wrote a dozen functional requirements that
          described how the email interface should work. Charlie was thrilled.
          He’d written many scripts for people, but he’d never seen written
          requirements before.</p><p class="calibre3">Unfortunately, I waited two weeks before writing the tests for
          this email function. Sure enough, one of the requirements had an
          error. I found the mistake because my mental image of how I expected
          the function to work, represented in about 20 tests, conflicted with
          one requirement. Chagrined, I corrected the bad requirement before
          Charlie had completed his implementation, and when he delivered the
          script, it was defect-free. Finding the error before implementation
          was a small victory, but small victories add up.</p></div><p class="calibre3">You can begin deriving conceptual tests from user requirements
        early in the development process (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-184">[ref046]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-176">[ref009]</a>). Use the tests to evaluate functional
        requirements, analysis models, and prototypes. The tests should cover
        the normal flow of each use case, alternative flows, and the
        exceptions you identified during elicitation and analysis. Similarly,
        if you identified business process flows, the tests should cover the
        business process steps and all possible decision paths.</p><p class="calibre3">These conceptual tests are independent of implementation. For
        example, consider a use case called “View a Stored Order” for the
        Chemical Tracking System. Some conceptual tests are:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">User enters order number to view, order exists, user had
            placed the order. Expected result: show order details.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">User enters order number to view, order doesn’t exist.
            Expected result: Display message “Sorry, I can’t find that
            order.”</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">User enters order number to view, order exists, user hadn’t
            placed the order. Expected result: Display message “Sorry, that’s
            not your order.”</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Ideally, a BA will write the functional requirements and a
        tester will write the tests from a common starting point: the user
        requirements, as shown in <a class="xref" title="Figure 17-5. Development and testing work products are derived from a common source." href="#calibre_link-338">Figure&nbsp;17-5</a>. Ambiguities in
        the user requirements and differences of interpretation will lead to
        inconsistencies between the views represented by the functional
        requirements, models, and tests. As developers translate requirements
        into user interface and technical designs, testers can elaborate the
        conceptual tests into detailed test procedures (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-339">[ref111]</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-338" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3118" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000074.gif" alt="A diagram showing user requirements branching into two               paths.

        described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 5. Establishing the business requirements" href="#calibre_link-32">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>
        one of the primary business objectives for the Chemical Tracking

        aligns with this business requirement is “Request a Chemical.” This
        use case includes a path that permits the user to request a chemical
        container that’s already available in the chemical stockroom. Here’s
        the use case description from <a class="xref" title="Figure 8-3. Partial specification of the Chemical Tracking System’s “Request a Chemical” use case." href="#calibre_link-173">Figure&nbsp;8-3</a> in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 8. Understanding user requirements" href="#calibre_link-35">Chapter&nbsp;8</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">The Requester specifies the desired chemical to

        was created far enough along in requirements development that the

        They don’t discuss entering data into specific fields, clicking
        buttons, or other specific interaction techniques. As development

        test procedures.</p><p class="calibre3">Now comes the fun part&mdash;testing the requirements. Ramesh first
        mapped each test to the functional requirements. He checked to make
        certain that every test could be “executed” by going through a set of
        existing requirements. He also made sure that at least one test
        covered each functional requirement. Next, Ramesh traced the execution
        path for every test on the dialog map with a highlighter pen. The

        to move directly from dialog box DB40 to DB70. However, the dialog map
        in <a class="xref" title="Figure 17-6. Portion of the dialog map for the “Request a Chemical” use case." href="#calibre_link-340">Figure&nbsp;17-6</a> doesn’t
        contain such a navigation line, so that test can’t be “executed” with
        the existing requirements set. Again, there are two possible
        interpretations. You’ll need to determine which of the following is
        correct:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The navigation from DB40 to DB70 is not a permitted system
            behavior, so the test is wrong.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The navigation from DB40 to DB70 is legitimate, but the
            dialog map and perhaps the SRS are missing the requirement that is
            exercised by the test.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">In these examples, the BA and the tester combined requirements,
        analysis models, and tests to detect missing, erroneous, or
        unnecessary requirements long before any code was written. Conceptual
        testing of software requirements is a powerful technique for
        controlling a project’s cost and schedule by finding requirement
        ambiguities and errors early in the game. As <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-184">[ref046]</a>

        product, but the customer is the final arbiter. Customers need to
        assess whether a system satisfies its predefined <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">acceptance
        criteria</em></span>. Acceptance criteria&mdash;and hence acceptance
        testing&mdash;should evaluate whether the product satisfies its documented
        requirements and whether it is fit for use in the intended operating
        environment (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-339">[ref111]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-93">[ref157]</a>;
        <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-342">[ref193]</a>). Having users devise acceptance tests is a
        valuable contributor to effective requirements development. The
        earlier that acceptance tests are written, the sooner they can help
        the team filter out defects in the requirements and, ultimately, in
        the implemented software.</p><div class="book" title="Acceptance criteria"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3122">Acceptance criteria</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Working with customers to develop acceptance criteria provides
          a way to validate both the requirements and the solution itself. If
          a customer can’t express how she would evaluate the system’s
          satisfaction of a particular requirement, that requirement is not
          clear enough. Acceptance criteria define the minimum conditions for
          an application to be considered business-ready.</p><p class="calibre3">Thinking about acceptance criteria offers a shift in
          perspective from the elicitation question of “What do you need to do
          with the system?” to “How would you judge whether the solution meets
          your needs?” Encourage users to use the SMART
          mnemonic&mdash;<span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Specific, Measurable, Attainable,
          Relevant</em></span>, and <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Time-sensitive</em></span>&mdash;when
          defining acceptance criteria. The criteria should be specified such
          that multiple objective observers would reach the same conclusion
          about whether they were satisfied. Acceptance criteria keep the
          focus on stakeholders’ business objectives and the conditions that
          would allow the project sponsor to declare victory. This is more
          important than simply delivering on a requirements specification
          that might not really solve the stakeholders’ business
          problems.</p><p class="calibre3">Defining acceptance criteria is more than just saying that all
          the requirements are implemented or all the tests passed. Acceptance
          tests constitute just a subset of acceptance criteria. Acceptance
          criteria could also encompass dimensions such as the
          following:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Specific high-priority functionality that must be present
              and operating properly before the product could be accepted and
              used. (Other planned functionality could perhaps be delivered
              later, or capabilities that aren’t working quite right could be
              fixed without delaying an initial release.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Essential nonfunctional criteria or quality metrics that
              must be satisfied. (Certain quality attributes must be at least
              minimally satisfied, although usability improvements, cosmetics,
              and performance tuning could be deferred. The product might have
              to meet quality metrics such as a certain minimum duration of
              operational usage without experiencing a failure.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-540" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-560" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1451" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1818" class="calibre"></a>Remaining open issues and defects. (You might
              stipulate that no defects exceeding a particular severity level
              remain open against high-priority requirements, although minor
              bugs could still be present.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Specific legal, regulatory, or contractual conditions.
              (These must be fully satisfied before the product is considered

              (not product) requirements. (Perhaps training materials must be

              be released.)</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">It can also be valuable to think of “rejection criteria,”
          conditions or assessment outcomes that would lead a stakeholder to
          deem the system not yet ready for delivery. Watch out for
          conflicting acceptance criteria, such that meeting one could block
          the satisfaction of another. In fact, looking for conflicting
          acceptance criteria early on is a way to discover conflicting
          requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">Agile projects create acceptance criteria based on user
          stories. As <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-93">[ref157]</a> put it,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Acceptance criteria are not functional or unit
            tests; rather, they are the conditions of satisfaction being

            testing all functional flows, exception flows, boundary
            conditions, and related functionality associated with the
            story.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">In principle, if all of the acceptance criteria for a user
          story are met, the product owner will accept the user story as being
          completed. Therefore, customers should be very specific in writing
          acceptance criteria that are important to them.</p></div><div class="book" title="Acceptance tests"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3123">Acceptance tests</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Acceptance tests constitute the largest portion of the
          acceptance criteria. Creators of acceptance tests should consider
          the most commonly performed and most important usage scenarios when
          deciding how to evaluate the software’s acceptability. Focus on
          testing the normal flows of the use cases and their corresponding
          exceptions, devoting less attention to the less frequently used
          alternative flows. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-342">[ref193]</a> offers a wealth of
          guidance for writing requirements-based acceptance tests.</p><p class="calibre3">Agile development approaches often create acceptance tests in
          lieu of writing precise functional requirements. Each test describes
          how a user story should function in the executable software. Because
          they are largely replacing detailed requirements, the acceptance
          tests on an agile project should cover all success and failure
          scenarios (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-93">[ref157]</a>). The value in writing
          acceptance tests is that it guides users to think about how the
          system will behave following implementation. The problem with
          writing <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">only</em></span> acceptance tests is that the
          requirements exist only in people’s minds. By not documenting and
          comparing alternate views of requirements&mdash;user requirements,
          functional requirements, analysis models, and tests&mdash;you can miss an
          opportunity to identify errors, inconsistencies, and gaps.</p><p class="calibre3">Automate the execution of acceptance tests whenever possible.
          This makes it easier to repeat the tests when changes are made and
          functionality is added in future iterations or releases. Acceptance
          tests must also address nonfunctional requirements. They should
          ensure that performance goals are achieved, that the system complies
          with usability standards, and that security expectations are
          fulfilled.</p><p class="calibre3">Some acceptance testing might be performed manually by users.
          The tests used in user acceptance testing (UAT) should be executed
          after a set of functionality is believed to be release-ready. This
          allows users to get their hands on the working software before it is
          officially delivered and permits users to familiarize themselves
          with the new software. The customer or product champion should
          select tests for UAT that represent the highest risk areas of the
          system. The acceptance tests will validate that the solution does
          what it is supposed to. Be sure to set up these tests using
          plausible test data. Suppose the test data used to generate a sales
          report isn’t realistic for the application. A user who is performing
          UAT might incorrectly report a defect just because the report
          doesn’t look right to him, or he might miss an erroneous calculation
          because the data is implausible.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3124" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Don’t expect user acceptance testing to replace
            comprehensive requirements-based system testing, which covers all
            the normal and exception paths and a wide variety of data
            combinations, boundary values, and other places where defects
            might lurk.</p></div><p class="calibre3">Writing requirements isn’t enough. You need to make sure that

      was meeting with the development lead for their line of tablet apps for
      musicians. “Prasad, I just learned that Fabrikam, Inc., is going to
      release a larger version of their tablet, called a Substrate. Right now
      our guitar amplifier emulator runs on their smaller tablet, the
      ScratchPad. We need to come up with a version for the Substrate. We can
      do more with the larger screen. The Substrate will come with the new
      release of their operating system, which will run on
      both.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“Wow, this is great,” said Prasad. “I’d like to be able
      to show more amp controls on the screen. We can make the controls bigger
      and easier to manipulate, too. We can reuse a lot of the core
      functionality from the ScratchPad emulator version. Unless Fabrikam
      changed the operating system APIs, we can reuse some of the code, too.
      We might want to drop some functionality in the ScratchPad version that
      our customers don’t use. We can add the solid state/tube hybrid amp
      sounds from the web version, but we need to make some changes to suit
      the frequency response on the tablet. This should be
      fun!”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">Reuse is an eternal goal for those seeking increased software
      productivity. People think most often in terms of code reuse, but many
      other software project components also have reuse potential. Reusing
      requirements can increase productivity and improve quality, as well as
      leading to greater consistency between related systems.</p><p class="calibre3">Reuse means taking advantage of work that has been done
      previously, whether on the same project or on an earlier project.
      Anytime you can avoid starting from scratch, you’ve got a running start
      on the project. The simplest way to reuse a requirement is to copy and
      paste it from an existing specification. The most sophisticated way is
      to reuse an entire functional component, from requirements through
      design, code, and tests. Numerous reuse options exist between these
      extremes.</p><p class="calibre3">Reuse is not free. It presents its own risks, both with respect to
      reusing existing items and to creating items with good reuse potential.
      It will likely take more time and effort to create high-quality reusable
      requirements than to write requirements you intend to use only on the
      current project. Despite the obvious merits, one study found that only
      about half of the organizations surveyed are actually practicing
      requirements reuse, primarily because of the poor quality of existing
      requirements (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-344">[ref039]</a>). An organization that is
      serious about reuse needs to establish some infrastructure to make
      existing high-quality requirements knowledge accessible to future BAs
      and to foster a culture that values reuse.</p><p class="calibre3">This chapter describes several kinds of requirements reuse,
      identifies some classes of requirements information that have reuse
      potential in various contexts, and offers suggestions about how to
      perform requirements reuse. It presents some issues around making
      requirements reusable. The chapter concludes with both barriers to
      effective reuse and success factors that can help your organization
      better take advantage of its existing body of requirements
      knowledge.</p><div class="book" title="Why reuse requirements?"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3127">Why reuse requirements?</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1710" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2005" class="calibre"></a>The benefits of effective requirements reuse include
        faster delivery, lower development costs, consistency both within and
        across applications, higher team productivity, fewer defects, and
        reduced rework. Reusing trusted requirements can save review time,
        accelerate the approval cycle, and speed up other project activities,
        such as testing. Reuse can improve your ability to estimate
        implementation effort if you have data available from implementing the
        same requirements on a previous project.</p><p class="calibre3">From the user’s perspective, requirements reuse can improve
        functional consistency across related members of a product line or
        among a set of business applications. Consider the ability to format
        blocks of text by applying the same styling, spacing, and other
        properties in all members of a suite of related applications. Making
        this work in a uniform fashion involves reusing both functional and
        usability requirements. Such consistency can minimize the user’s
        learning curve and frustration levels. It also saves time for
        stakeholders, who then will not need to specify similar requirements
        repeatedly.</p><p class="calibre3">Even if the implementation varies in different environments, the
        requirements might be the same. An airline’s website might have a
        feature to let a passenger check in for a flight, pay for seat
        upgrades, and print boarding passes. The airline might also have
        self-service check-in kiosks at airports. The functionality for both
        check-in operations will be nearly identical, and hence reusable
        across the two products, even though the implementations and user
        experiences are dissimilar.</p></div><div class="book" title="Dimensions of requirements reuse"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3128">Dimensions of requirements reuse</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">We can imagine several types of requirements reuse. Sometimes a
        business analyst will recognize that a user-presented requirement
        resembles one from a previous project. Perhaps he can retrieve that
        existing requirement and adapt it for the new project. Such ad hoc
        reuse is most common with experienced BAs who have good memories and
        access to previous requirements collections. In other cases, a BA
        might use some existing requirements during elicitation to help users
        identify topics to consider for the new system. It’s easier to modify
        something that exists than to create something new.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Table 18-1. Three dimensions of requirements reuse" href="#calibre_link-345">Table&nbsp;18-1</a>
        describes three dimensions of requirements reuse: the extent of assets
        being reused, the extent to which an item must be modified for use in
        its new setting, and the mechanism being used to perform the reuse.
        When you’re contemplating reusing requirements information, think
        about which option in each of these dimensions is most appropriate and
        practical for meeting your objectives.</p><div class="table"><a id="calibre_link-345" class="calibre"></a><div class="table-title">Table&nbsp;18-1.&nbsp;Three dimensions of requirements reuse</div><div class="book"><table class="calibre7"><colgroup class="calibre8"><col class="col"></col><col class="col"></col></colgroup><tbody class="calibre9"><tr class="calibre10"><td class="calibre11"><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1317" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Dimension</strong></span></p></td><td class="calibre13"><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Options</strong></span></p></td></tr><tr class="calibre14"><td class="calibre11"><p class="calibre3">Extent

          more if those are relevant to the target project. In some cases you
          can reuse not just the requirement but also associated artifacts:
          data definitions, acceptance tests, relevant business rules,
          constraints, assumptions, and so on. Often, a set of related
          requirements can be reused, such as all the functional requirements
          associated with a particular feature. Applications that run on
          similar platforms, such as different smartphone operating systems,
          could reuse requirements and design elements but perhaps not much
          code.</p><p class="calibre3">In the ideal scenario you can reuse a whole package of
          requirements, models, design components, code, and tests. That is,
          you reuse an entire chunk of implemented functionality essentially
          unchanged from a related product. This level of reuse can work when
          common operations are being employed across various projects on a
          common platform. Examples of such operations are error-handling
          strategies, internal data logging and reporting, communication
          protocol abstractions, and help systems. These functions must be
          developed for reuse with clear application programming interfaces
          (APIs) and all supporting documentation and test artifacts.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3130" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">A reuse success tale</div><p class="calibre3">I once worked for a large retailer that was merging two
            online catalogs, one for consumers and one for corporations, into
            a single new system. The business objective was to reduce
            maintenance costs and make it easier to add new features that
            would appear in both catalogs. We developed the consumer catalog
            requirements first, based on the existing catalog functionality.
            For the corporate side, we started with those same consumer
            catalog requirements, then edited those that had to vary. Some new
            requirements were added for the new corporate catalog as well. The
            project delivered on schedule partly because of the time savings
            from reuse.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Extent of modification"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3131">Extent of modification</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1038" class="calibre"></a>The next dimension to consider is how much
          modification will be needed to make existing requirements reusable
          on the new project. In some cases, you’ll be able to reuse a
          requirement unchanged. In the example given earlier about the
          airline’s check-in kiosk, many of the functional requirements would
          be identical for the kiosk and for a website that offers passenger
          check-in. In other cases, you might reuse a requirement statement
          unchanged but have to modify some of its attributes, such as its
          priority or rationale as it applies to the new system. Often, you
          will start with an existing requirement but modify it to exactly
          suit the new purpose. Finally, whether or not you change the
          requirement, you might need to modify some designs and tests. An
          example is porting functionality from a PC to a tablet that has a
          touch screen rather than a mouse-and-keyboard interface.</p></div><div class="book" title="Reuse mechanism"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3132">Reuse mechanism</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The most rudimentary form of reuse is simply a copy-and-paste
          of a piece of requirements information, either from another
          specification or from a library of reusable requirements. You don’t
          retain a history of where the original information came from, and
          you can modify the copies you make. Copy-and-paste within a project
          increases the size of your specifications because you’re duplicating
          information. If you find yourself populating a specification by
          doing a lot of copy-and-paste, a warning bell should ring. And just
          as when you copy code, copying and pasting requirements can
          introduce problems because of context issues, when the context isn’t
          carried across with the paste operation.</p><p class="calibre3">In most cases, you’re better off reusing existing content by
          referring to it instead of replicating it. This means that the
          original source of the information must be accessible to anyone who
          needs to view the requirement, and it must be persistent. If you’re
          storing your requirements in a document and want the same
          requirement to appear in multiple places, you can use the
          cross-referencing feature of your word processor to link copies back
          to the master instance (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>). When the master
          instance is altered, the change is echoed everywhere you inserted a
          cross-reference link. This avoids the inconsistencies that can arise
          when one instance gets changed manually but others do not. However,
          it also runs the risk of all those requirements changing if someone
          else can alter the master instance.</p><p class="calibre3">Another copy-by-reference mechanism is to store not the actual
          requirement information but simply a pointer to it in your project
          documentation. Suppose you want to reuse descriptions of some user
          classes from other projects in your organization. First, collect
          such reusable information into a shared location. Possible forms for
          this collection include a word processing file, spreadsheet, HTML or
          XML file, database, and a specialized requirements tool. Give each
          object in that collection a unique identifier. To incorporate that
          information by reference, enter the identifier for each object you
          want to reuse in the appropriate section of your document. If
          technology allows, include a hyperlink directly to the reused object
          in the information collection. A reader who wants to view that user
          class description can simply follow the link to go to the master
          source. If you maintain that collection of reusable artifacts
          properly, those links and the destination information will always be
          current.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2012" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2115" class="calibre"></a>A much more effective way to reuse by reference is to
          store requirements in a requirements management tool, as described
          in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 30. Tools for requirements engineering" href="#calibre_link-90">Chapter&nbsp;30</a>. Depending
          on the tool’s capabilities, you might be able to reuse a requirement
          that is already in the database without replicating it. Some such
          tools retain historical versions of individual requirements, which
          allows you to reuse a specific version of a requirement or set of
          related requirements. If someone modifies that requirement in the
          database, the older version that you are reusing still exists. You
          can then tailor your own version of that requirement to suit the
          needs of your project without disrupting other reusers.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 18-1. How a requirement can evolve through reuse in multiple projects." href="#calibre_link-346">Figure&nbsp;18-1</a>
          illustrates this process. Project A creates the initial version of a
          particular requirement. Later on, Project B decides to reuse that
          same requirement, so the two projects share a common version. Then
          Project A modifies that requirement, thereby spawning version 2.
          However, version 1 still exists unchanged for use in Project B. If
          Project B needs to modify its copy later, it creates version 3,
          which does not affect any other project using any other version of
          that same requirement.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-346" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3133" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000077.jpeg" alt="An illustration showing Project B, Project A, and                 Project C above each other on the left and time going from                 left to right.

        applications across an organization, or even developing a product
        having a feature that appears in multiple contexts, there are
        opportunities for reuse. Let’s look at some scenarios where
        requirements reuse offers good potential.</p><div class="book" title="Software product lines"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3136">Software product lines</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Anytime you’re creating a set of products in a family&mdash;a
          software product line&mdash;those products will have a lot of
          functionality in common. Sometimes you’re producing variations of a
          base product for different customers or markets. Requirements you’ve
          incorporated into a specific variant for a particular customer might
          be folded into a common specification for the base product. Other
          product lines involve a family of related products that are based on
          a common architectural platform. For example, the vendor of a
          popular income tax preparation package offers a free version for
          online use as well as basic, deluxe, premier, home and business, and
          business versions for use on personal computers. Analyze the
          features in the software product line to see which ones are:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1454" class="calibre"></a>Common, appearing in all members of the product
              line.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Optional, appearing in certain family members but not
              others.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Variants, with different versions of the feature appearing

          reusing not just certain requirements, but also their downstream
          work products, including architectural components, design elements,
          code, and tests. This is the most powerful form of reuse, but we
          don’t often detect the opportunity to take advantage of it. Reusing
          the common functionality is far better than reimplementing it each
          time, perhaps making it slightly different without good reason. Be
          aware of any constraints that the operating environment or hardware
          platform of certain products might impose that could limit reuse
          options. If the implementation must be different in certain
          product-line members, you’re limited to reusing only requirements,
          not designs and code.</p></div><div class="book" title="Reengineered and replacement systems"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3137">Reengineered and replacement systems</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Reengineered and replacement systems always reuse some

          possible reuse, you might need to move your thinking up to a higher
          level of abstraction to get away from specific implementation
          characteristics. Often, you can harvest business rules that were

        requirements easier can be regarded as reuse. That’s the rationale
        behind requirement patterns: to package considerable knowledge about a

        wants to define such a requirement.</p><p class="calibre3">Pioneered by <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-211">[ref253]</a>, a <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">requirement

        particular type of requirement. A pattern defines a template with
        categories of information for each of the common types of requirements
        a project might encounter. Different types of requirement patterns
        will have their own sets of content categories. Populating the
        template will likely provide a more detailed specification of a
        requirement than if the BA simply wrote it in natural language. The

        <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-211">[ref253]</a> provides a pattern for specifying
        requirements that define reports. Withall’s pattern includes a

        specifying, implementing, and testing such requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">You can create requirement patterns of your own that are ideally
        suited to your organization’s style and projects. Following a pattern
        helps create consistency and will likely give you richer and more
        precise requirements. Simple templates like these remind you about
        important information that you might otherwise overlook. If you need
        to write a requirement on an unfamiliar topic, using a pattern is
        likely to be quicker than researching the topic yourself.</p></div><div class="book" title="Tools to facilitate reuse"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3141">Tools to facilitate reuse</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">In an ideal world, your organization would store all of its
        software requirements in a requirements management tool with a
        complete set of traceability links. These links would tie each
        requirement back to a parent requirement or other origin, to other
        requirements it depends on, and to downstream development artifacts
        that are linked to it. Every historical version of each requirement
        would be available. This is the best way to enable effective reuse on
        a large scale across a whole application, product portfolio, or
        organization.</p><p class="calibre3">Few organizations have reached this level of sophistication, but
        storing your requirements in a tool will still enhance reuse in
        several ways (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-352">[ref002]</a>). Commercial requirements
        management tools provide various capabilities to facilitate reuse.
        Some even contain large libraries of requirements from certain domains
        available for ready reuse. When you’re selecting a tool, include your
        expectations regarding how it will help you reuse requirements as part
        of the evaluation process. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 30. Tools for requirements engineering" href="#calibre_link-90">Chapter&nbsp;30</a> describes typical
        capabilities of commercially available requirements management
        tools.</p><p class="calibre3">A tool might allow you to reuse a specific requirement by
        sharing it across multiple projects or baselines. If you do this, you
        need to think about what should happen if you change either the
        original requirement or its clones. Some tools let you lock the
        content so you can edit only the original instance of the requirement.
        This ensures that any places where that requirement is reused are also
        updated at the time of the editing. Of course, if you start with a
        reused requirement and then <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">do</em></span> want to modify it
        for use in its new setting, you don’t want to keep that lock in place.
        In that case, you would like to copy it using a mode that permits you
        to change the copied requirement.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1338" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2006" class="calibre"></a>Similarly, when you copy a requirement that has
        associated traceability relationships, you might or might not want to
        carry along everything that is linked to it. Sometimes, you might want
        to pull just the requirement, plus its children and requirements on
        which it depends, into a new project. This would be the case if the
        function is the same but the delivery platforms differ, as is the case
        with applications that run on a web browser, tablet, smartphone, and
        kiosk.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3142" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">If BAs can’t find what they’re looking for in the reuse
          repository, it doesn’t matter how good the stored requirements are
          or how much time they might save: the BAs will write their own.
          Writing reusable requirements according to standard patterns
          provides a set of fields on which to search. Some people advocate
          adding meaningful keywords or requirement attributes to assist with
          searching.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Making requirements reusable"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3143">Making requirements reusable</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Just because a requirement exists doesn’t mean it’s reusable in
        its present form. It could be specific to a particular project. It
        might be written at too high a level because the BA could safely
        assume certain knowledge on the part of the development team or
        because some details were communicated only verbally. A requirement
        could be lacking information about how possible exceptions should be
        handled. You might have to tune up the original requirements to
        increase their value to future BAs.</p><p class="calibre3">Well-written requirements lend themselves to reuse. The steps
        you take to make requirements more reusable also increases their value
        to the project for which you originally write them; it simply makes
        them better requirements. Reusers need to know about dependencies each
        requirement has on others, as well as other requirements that go with
        it and that might also be reused, so that they can package sets of
        related requirements appropriately. Although
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">reuse</em></span> saves your team time and money, making
        something readily <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">reusable</em></span> is likely to cost time
        and money.</p><p class="calibre3">Reusable requirements must be written at the right level of
        abstraction and scope. Domain-specific requirements are written at a
        low level of abstraction. They are likely to be applicable only in
        their original domain (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-353">[ref218]</a>). Generic
        requirements have broader applicability for reuse in a variety of
        systems. However, if you attempt to reuse requirements at too general
        a level, you won’t save much effort because the BA will still have to
        elaborate the details. It’s tricky to find the right balance between
        making reuse easier (with more abstract or generalized requirements)
        and making reuse pay off (with more detailed or specific
        requirements).</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 18-2. Generalized requirements offer greater reuse potential." href="#calibre_link-354">Figure&nbsp;18-2</a>
        provides an example. Perhaps you’re building an application that
        includes a user requirement to accept credit card payments. This user
        requirement would expand into a set of related functional and
        nonfunctional requirements around handling credit card payments. Other
        applications also might need to take payments by credit card, so
        that’s a potentially reusable set of requirements.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-354" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3144" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000078.jpeg" alt="An illustration showing a box labeled Accept Credit Card               Payment in the lower left as the initial user requirement. A box               to the right shows project number 2 reusing that requirement. A               higher box shows a version of that user requirement now               generalized to Accept Payment. Multiple projects reuse that               generalized user requirement." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;18-2.&nbsp;Generalized requirements offer greater reuse
          potential.</div></div><p class="calibre3">But suppose you could generalize that user requirement to
        encompass several payment mechanisms: credit card, debit card, gift
        card, eCheck, and electronic funds transfer. The resulting requirement
        offers greater reuse potential in a wider range of future projects.
        One project might need just credit card processing, whereas others
        require several of the payment processing methods. Generalizing an
        initial user requirement like this&mdash;from “accept credit card payment”
        to “accept payment”&mdash;could be valuable even on the current project.
        Even if the customer only asked to handle credit card payments
        initially, users might really like to accept multiple payment methods
        either now or in the future.</p><p class="calibre3">Choosing the right abstraction level for requirements can pay
        off during construction, as well. On one project that had exactly this
        need for multiple payment methods, generating clear requirements and
        rules for each case revealed both commonalities and distinctions.
        Independent from future reuse possibilities, building the higher-level
        abstractions contributed to easier design and construction.</p><p class="calibre3">That’s the good news. The bad news is that it will take some
        effort to generalize the initially presented requirement. That’s the
        investment you make in reusability, anticipating that you will recoup
        the investment&mdash;and more&mdash;through multiple, future reuse instances. It’s
        up to you to decide whether to simply place today’s requirements into
        a shared location for possible reuse or to invest effort to improve
        their reusability on future projects.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3145" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">The “reusable requirements” explosion</div><p class="calibre3">A colleague offered a cautionary tale of how to reduce the
          potential value of reuse by writing excessively detailed
          requirements. A team tasked with writing requirements for a new
          project was obsessed with reuse. The BAs thought that if they
          documented all of the details for each requirement separately, then
          they could be reused. They ended up with more than 14,000
          requirements! The repository contained entries that should have been
          just one requirement but had been structured as a parent with
          multiple child requirements, each giving a specific detail about the
          parent. Requirements this detailed were relevant only to that one
          application.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1037" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1566" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1570" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2292" class="calibre"></a>This volume of requirements also made the testing
          cycle much more difficult, leading to daily complaints from the
          testers. It was taking them much longer than expected to write test
          cases because they had to wade through such a vast quantity of
          requirements. The testers had to document the requirement ID in
          their test cases to ensure that test coverage of the requirements
          was achieved for traceability, but the number of traces on this many
          requirements became difficult to manage. In addition, the
          requirements underwent extensive change; they never did fully
          stabilize. All of these factors led to the project being deployed a
          year late, without producing the desired collection of reusable
          requirements.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Requirements reuse barriers and success factors"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3146">Requirements reuse barriers and success factors</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Requirements reuse sounds like a grand idea, but it isn’t always
        practical or appropriate. This section describes some considerations
        to help your organization succeed with requirements reuse.</p><div class="book" title="Reuse barriers"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3147">Reuse barriers</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The first step to overcoming an obstacle is to recognize and
          understand it. Following are several barriers you might encounter
          when it comes to reusing requirements.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Missing or poor
          requirements</strong></span> A common barrier is that the requirements
          developed on previous projects weren’t documented, so it’s
          impossible to reuse them. And even if you find a relevant
          requirement, it might be badly written, incomplete, or a poor fit
          for your present circumstances. Even if they’re documented, the
          original requirements for an old application might not have been
          kept current as the application evolved over time, rendering them
          obsolete.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">NIH and NAH</strong></span> Two barriers to
          reuse are NIH and NAH syndromes. NIH means “not invented here.” Some
          people are reluctant to reuse requirements from another organization
          or generic requirements found in a public collection. Requirements
          written elsewhere could be harder to understand: terminology could
          be different; the requirements might refer to documents that are
          unavailable; you might not be able to discern the context of the
          original requirements; and important background information could go
          unexplained. A BA might correctly decide that it takes less work to
          write new requirements than to understand and fix up the existing
          ones.</p><p class="calibre3">NAH, or “not applicable here,” syndrome reveals itself when
          practitioners protest that a new process or approach does not apply
          to their project or organization. “We’re different,” they claim. The
          members might feel that their project is unique, so no existing
          requirements could possibly apply. Sometimes that’s true, but often
          NIH and NAH indicate an inflexible attitude.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Writing style</strong></span> The BAs on
          previous projects might have used a wide variety of requirements
          representation techniques and conventions. It’s best to adopt some
          standard notations for documenting requirements to facilitate reuse,
          such as using patterns. If requirements are written at a common
          level of granularity, it’s easier for future BAs to search for
          candidate requirements at the right level of detail. Consistent
          terminology is also important. You might overlook a potentially
          reusable requirement simply because some of the terminology involved
          is not the same as what your stakeholders are used to. Requirements
          written in natural language are notoriously prone to ambiguities,
          missing information, and hidden assumptions. These issues reduce
          their reuse potential.</p><p class="calibre3">Requirements that have embedded design constraints will offer
          little opportunity for reuse in a different environment. Think about
          the airport check-in kiosk described earlier. If user interface
          details about the kiosk were embedded in the requirements, you
          couldn’t reuse those requirements for software having essentially
          the same functionality but running on a website.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Inconsistent organization</strong></span>
          It can be difficult to find requirements to reuse because authors
          organize their requirements in many different ways: by project,
          process flow, business unit, product feature, category, subsystem or
          component, and so forth.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Project type</strong></span> Requirements
          that are tightly coupled to specific implementation environments or
          platforms are less likely to generate reusable requirements or to
          benefit from an existing pool of requirements knowledge. Rapidly
          evolving domains don’t yet have a pool of requirements information
          to reuse; requirements that are relevant today might be obsolete
          tomorrow.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Ownership</strong></span> Another barrier
          has to do with ownership (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-27">[ref223]</a>). If you’re
          developing a software product for a specific customer, its
          requirements are likely the proprietary intellectual property of the
          customer. You might not have the legal right to reuse any of those
          requirements in a different system you develop for your own company
          or for other customers.</p></div><div class="book" title="Reuse success factors"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3148">Reuse success factors</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">An organization that is serious about reuse should create
          mechanisms to make it easy to share and take advantage of existing
          information. This means pulling information that has the potential
          for reuse out of a specific project so others can access and reuse
          it. Keep the following success tips in mind.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Repository</strong></span> You can’t reuse
          something if you can’t find it. An enabling tool for effective
          large-scale reuse, therefore, is a searchable repository in which to
          store requirements information. This repository could take several
          forms:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">A single network folder that contains previous
              requirements documents</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">A collection of requirements stored in a requirements
              management tool that can be searched across projects</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">A database that stores sets of requirements culled from
              projects for their reuse potential and enhanced with keywords to
              help future BAs know their origin, judge their suitability, and
              learn about their limitations</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Consider giving someone the responsibility to manage the
          reusable requirements repository. This person would adapt existing
          requirements knowledge as necessary to represent and store the
          assets in a form suitable for efficient discovery, retrieval, and
          reuse. A scheme similar to that used to store and manage business
          rules as an enterprise asset could be adapted to handle reusable
          requirements.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1319" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1821" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2279" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Quality</strong></span> No one
          wants to reuse junk. Potential reusers need confidence in the
          quality of the information. And even if a requirement you are
          reusing isn’t perfect, you should try to make it better when you
          reuse it. This way you iteratively improve a requirement over time,
          increasing its reuse potential for future projects.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Interactions</strong></span> Requirements
          often have logical links or dependencies on each other. Use
          traceability links in a tool to identify these dependencies so
          people know just what they’re getting into when they select a
          requirement for reuse. Reused requirements must conform to existing
          business rules, constraints, standards, interfaces, and quality
          expectations.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Terminology</strong></span> Establishing
          common terminology and definitions across your projects will be
          helpful for reusability. Terminology variations won’t prevent you
          from reusing requirements, but you’ll have to deal with the
          inconsistencies and take steps to prevent misunderstandings.
          Glossaries and data dictionaries are good sources of reusable
          information. Rather than incorporating an entire glossary into every
          requirements specification, create links from key terms to their
          definitions in the shared glossary.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Organizational culture</strong></span>
          Management should encourage reuse from two perspectives:
          contributing high-quality components with real reuse potential, and
          effectively reusing existing artifacts. The individuals, project
          teams, and organizations that practice reuse most effectively are
          likely to enjoy the highest productivity. In a reuse culture, BAs
          look at the reusable requirements repository before creating their
          own requirements. They might start with a user story or other
          high-level requirement statement and see to what extent they can
          populate the details through reuse of existing information.</p><p class="calibre3">Your project requirements constitute valuable corporate
          information. To maximize the investment your teams make in
          requirements engineering, look for requirements knowledge that you
          can treat as an enterprise-level asset. The requirements you reuse
          do not have to be perfect to be valuable. Even if they just save you
          20 percent of the work you might have otherwise spent writing new
          requirements, that’s a big gain. A culture that encourages BAs to
          borrow first and create second, and that makes a little extra
          investment in making requirements reusable, can increase the
          productivity of both analysts and development teams and lead to
          higher-quality products.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3149" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Next steps</div><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Examine your current project to see if you can simplify

      Gerhard, had been skeptical of the need to spend time defining
      requirements. However, he joined the development team and product

      motivated him to support the requirements activities.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">As the project progressed, Gerhard received excellent
      feedback from the user representatives about how well requirements
      development had gone. He even sponsored a luncheon for the analysts and
      product champions to celebrate reaching the significant milestone of
      baselined requirements for the first system release. At the luncheon,
      Gerhard thanked the participants for their effective teamwork. Then he
      said, “Now that the requirements are done, I look forward to seeing the

      product for about a year,” the project manager explained. “We plan to
      deliver the system through a series of bimonthly releases. If we take
      the time to think about design now, it will be easier for developers to
      add more functionality later. We’ll also learn more about requirements
      as we go along. We will show you some working software at each release,
      though.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Gerhard was frustrated. It looked like the development
      team was stalling rather than getting down to the real work of
      programming. But was he jumping the gun?</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">Experienced project managers and developers understand the value
      of translating software requirements into rational project plans and
      robust designs. These steps are necessary whether the next release
      represents 1 percent or 100 percent of the final product. This chapter
      explores some approaches for bridging the gap between requirements
      development and a successful product release. Some of these activities
      are the business analyst’s responsibility, whereas others fall within
      the project manager’s domain. We’ll look at several ways in which
      requirements influence project plans, designs, code, and tests, as shown
      in <a class="xref" title="Figure 19-1. Requirements drive project planning, design, coding, and testing activities." href="#calibre_link-356">Figure&nbsp;19-1</a>. In
      addition to these connections, there is a link between the requirements
      for the software to be built and other project and transition
      requirements. Those include data migrations, training design and
      delivery, business process and organizational changes, infrastructure
      modifications, and others. Those activities aren’t discussed further in
      this book.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-356" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3152" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000079.jpeg" alt="An illustration showing a box labeled baselined             requirements at the left, with arrows going to the right to ovals             labeled project plans, designs and code, and tests.

        judge how much of the project’s schedule and effort should be devoted
        to requirements activities. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a> suggests some
        ways to judge this and some factors that would lead you to spend
        either more or less time than you might otherwise expect. Small
        projects typically spend 15 to 18 percent of their total effort on
        requirements work (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-66">[ref240]</a>), but the appropriate
        percentage depends on the size and complexity of the project. Despite
        the fear that exploring requirements will slow down a project,
        considerable evidence shows that taking time to understand the
        requirements actually accelerates development, as the following
        examples illustrate:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">A study of 15 projects in the telecommunications and banking
            industries revealed that the most successful projects spent 28

            validation, and verification (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-76">[ref109]</a>). The

        project in different ways, depending on whether the project is
        following a sequential (waterfall), iterative, or incremental
        development life cycle, as was illustrated in <a class="xref" title="Figure 3-3. The distribution of requirements development effort over time varies for projects that follow different development life cycles." href="#calibre_link-80">Figure&nbsp;3-3</a> in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 3. Good practices for requirements engineering" href="#calibre_link-6">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3154" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Watch out for analysis paralysis. A project with massive
          up-front effort aimed at perfecting the requirements “once and for
          all” often delivers little useful functionality in an appropriate
          time frame. On the other hand, don’t avoid requirements development
          because of the specter of analysis paralysis. As with so many issues
          in life, a sensible balance point lies somewhere between the two
          extremes.</p></div><p class="calibre3">When estimating the effort a project should devote to
        requirements development, let experience be your guide. Look back at
        the requirements effort from previous projects and judge how effective
        the requirements work on those projects was. If you can attribute
        issues to poor requirements, perhaps more emphasis on requirements
        work would pay off for you. Of course, this assessment demands that
        you retain some historical data from previous projects so you can
        better estimate future projects. You might not have any such data now,
        but if team members record how they spend their time on today’s
        project, that becomes tomorrow’s “historical data.” It’s not more
        complicated than that. Recording both estimated and actual effort
        allows you to think of how you can improve future estimates.</p><p class="calibre3">The requirements engineering consulting company Seilevel (Joy’s
        company) developed an effective approach for estimating a project’s
        requirements development effort, refined from work estimates and
        actual results from many projects. This approach involves three
        complementary estimates: percent of total work; a developer-to-BA
        ratio; and an activity breakdown that uses basic resource costs to
        generate a bottom-up estimate. Comparing the results from all three
        estimates and reconciling any significant disconnects allows the
        business analyst team to generate the most accurate estimates.</p><p class="calibre3">The first estimate is based on a percentage of the estimated
        total project work. Specifically, we consider that about 15 percent of
        the total project effort should be allocated to requirements work.
        This value is in line with the percentages cited earlier in this
        section. So if the full project is estimated at 1,000 hours, we
        estimate 150 hours of requirements work. Of course, the overall
        project estimate might change after the requirements are better
        understood.</p><p class="calibre3">The second type of estimate assumes a typical ratio of
        developers to business analysts. Our default value is 6:1, meaning
        that one BA can produce enough requirements to keep six developers
        busy. The BAs also will be working with quality assurance, project
        management, and the business itself, so this estimate encompasses all
        of the BA team’s project work. For a packaged solution (COTS) project,
        this ratio changes to 3:1 (three developers per BA). There are still
        many selection, configuration, and transition requirements to be
        elicited and documented, but the development team is smaller because
        the code is largely purchased instead of developed new. So if we know
        the development team size, we can estimate an appropriate BA staffing
        level. This is a rule-of-thumb estimator, not a cast-in-concrete
        prediction of the future, so be sure to adjust for your organization
        and project type.</p><p class="calibre3">The third estimate considers the various activities a BA
        performs, based on estimates of the numbers of various artifacts that
        might be created on a specific project. The BA can estimate the number
        of process flows, user stories, screens, reports, and the like and
        then make reasonable assumptions of how many other requirements
        artifacts are needed. Based on time estimates per activity that we
        have accumulated from multiple projects, we can generate a total
        requirements effort estimate.</p><p class="calibre3">We created a spreadsheet tool for calculating all three of these
        requirements estimates, which is available with this book’s companion
        content. <a class="xref" title="Figure 19-2. Partial output from the requirements effort estimation spreadsheet." href="#calibre_link-358">Figure&nbsp;19-2</a>
        illustrates a portion of the spreadsheet’s results. The Summary Total
        Effort Comparison shows the estimates for the number of BAs and the BA
        budgets for both the requirements work and the entire project. These
        estimates serve as a starting point for reconciling the differences,
        negotiating resources, and planning the project’s BA needs.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-358" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3155" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000080.jpeg" alt="A screen shot of a spreadsheet that lists the number of               business analysts and their budget for a particular project.               Items to consider include the existing pages of documentation to               review, the number of stakeholders, total project budget, number               of screens, and the hourly cost for each BA." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;19-2.&nbsp;Partial output from the requirements effort estimation
          spreadsheet.</div></div><p class="calibre3">The requirements estimation tool has three worksheet tabs.
        First, there is a summary where you input several project
        characteristics. The tool will calculate various elements of the three
        types of estimates. Second, there is an assumptions tab where you can
        adjust items that vary from the provided assumptions. The third tab
        provides instructions about how to use the estimation tool.</p><p class="calibre3">The assumptions built into this estimation tool are based on
        Seilevel’s extensive experience with actual projects. You’ll need to
        tweak some of the assumptions for your own organization. For example,
        if your BAs are either novices or especially highly experienced, some
        of your estimates of the time needed per activity may vary from the
        defaults. To tailor the tool to best suit your reality, collect some
        data from your own projects and modify the adjustable
        parameters.</p><div class="note" title="Important"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3156" class="calibre"></a>Important</h3><p class="calibre3">All estimates are based on the knowledge the estimator has
          available at the time and the assumptions he makes. Preliminary
          estimates based on limited information have large uncertainties.
          Refine your estimates as knowledge is gained and work is completed
          during the project. Record your assumptions so that it’s clear what
          you were thinking when you came up with the numbers.</p></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3157" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Betty’s in a corner</div><p class="calibre3">Sridhar, the project manager of a million-dollar project,
          approached the BA, Betty, to discuss her initial estimate regarding
          how long requirements development would take. In an earlier email
          exchange she had estimated eight weeks. Sridhar asked, “Betty, is it
          really going to take you eight weeks to do the requirements for our
          shopping portal? Surely your team can have it done in four weeks;
          the system is just not that complex. I mean, really, people come to
          the website to search for and buy products. That’s it! Heck, the
          development manager is thinking that his team can just develop the
          system without any requirements at all, so that’s what they’re
          planning to do if you don’t have the requirements done in four
          weeks.”</p><p class="calibre3">Betty is backed into a corner here. She can give in and agree
          to an unreasonable four-week deadline for this large project. Or,
          she can push back at the risk of looking ineffective because the
          project is supposed to be “simple.” After all, Betty isn’t actually
          sure how long it will take her to develop an adequate set of
          requirements, because she doesn’t yet know the size of the system.
          Until she begins the analysis, she doesn’t know what she doesn’t
          know.</p><p class="calibre3">Variations on this story are a big part of why Seilevel
          developed the estimation tool described in this chapter. This tool
          aids Betty in her stressful conversation with Sridhar. She can say,
          “Well, if I only have four weeks, let me show you what I CAN do.”
          She can tweak the numbers of reports or processes for which
          requirements are needed. Betty can effectively timebox the
          requirements effort. However, it’s important for Sridhar to
          recognize that understanding the requirements for only the tip of
          the iceberg can lead to unpleasant surprises further down the
          road.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="From requirements to project plans"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3158">From requirements to project plans</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Because requirements are the foundation for the project’s
        intended work, you should base estimates, project plans, and schedules
        on those requirements. Remember, the most important project outcome is
        a system that meets its business objectives, not simply one that
        implements all the initial requirements according to the original
        project plan. The requirements and plans represent the team’s
        assessment at a specific point in time of what it will take to achieve
        that outcome. But the project’s scope might have been off target, or
        the initial plans might not have been realistic or well-aligned with
        the objectives. Business needs, business rules, and project
        constraints all can change. The project’s business success will be
        problematic if you don’t update your plans to align with evolving
        objectives and realities.</p><div class="book" title="Estimating project size and effort from requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3159">Estimating project size and effort from requirements</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-573" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1072" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1161" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1274" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1424" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1484" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1737" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1765" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2088" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2209" class="calibre"></a>Making realistic estimates of the effort and time
          needed to complete a project depends on many factors, but it begins
          with estimating the size of the product to be built. You can base
          size estimates on functional requirements, user stories, analysis
          models, prototypes, or user interface designs. Although there’s no
          perfect measure of software size, the following are some frequently
          used metrics:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The number of individually testable requirements (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-223">[ref252]</a>)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Function points (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-359">[ref132]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-360">[ref114]</a>)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Story points (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-361">[ref044]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-362">[ref168]</a>) or use case points (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The number, type, and complexity of user interface

              requirements</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Base whatever approach you choose on your experience and on
          the nature of the software you’re developing. Understanding what the
          development team has successfully achieved on similar projects using
          similar technologies lets you gauge team productivity. After you
          estimate size and productivity, you can estimate the total effort
          needed to implement the project. Effort estimates depend on the team
          size (multitasking people are less productive, and more
          communication interfaces slow things down) and planned schedule
          (compressed schedules actually increase the total effort
          needed).</p><p class="calibre3">One approach is to use commercial software estimation tools
          that suggest various feasible combinations of development effort and
          schedule. These tools let you adjust estimates based on factors such
          as the skill of the developers, project complexity, and the team’s
          experience in the application domain. Complex, nonlinear
          relationships exist between product size, effort, development time,
          productivity, and staff buildup time (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-363">[ref194]</a>).
          Understanding these relationships can keep you from being trapped in
          the “impossible region,” combinations of product size, schedule, and
          team size where the probability of success is extremely low.</p><p class="calibre3">The best estimation processes acknowledge the early
          uncertainty and ongoing volatility of scope. People using such a
          process will express each estimate as a range, not a single value.
          They manage the accuracy of their estimate by widening the range
          based on the uncertainty and volatility of the data that fed into
          the estimate.</p><p class="calibre3">Agile projects estimate scope in units of <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">story
          points</em></span>, a measure of the relative effort that will be
          needed to implement a particular user story. Estimates of the size
          of a specific story depend on the knowledge you have&mdash;and lack&mdash;about
          the story, its complexity, and the functionality involved (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-93">[ref157]</a>). Agile teams measure their team’s
          <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">velocity</em></span>, the number of story points the team
          expects to complete in a standard iteration based on its previous
          experience and the results from early iterations on a new project.
          The team members combine the size of the product backlog with
          velocity to estimate the project’s schedule, cost, and the number of
          iterations required. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-93">[ref157]</a> describes several
          techniques for estimating and planning agile projects in this
          fashion.</p><div class="note" title="Important"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3160" class="calibre"></a>Important</h3><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1425" class="calibre"></a>If you don’t compare your estimates to the actual
            project results and improve your estimating ability, your
            estimates will forever remain guesses. It takes time to accumulate
            enough data to correlate some measure of software size with
            requirements development effort and with total project effort. The
            early iterations on agile projects give the team an assessment of
            its velocity.</p></div><p class="calibre3">Even a good estimating process will be challenged if your
          project must cope with requirements that customers, managers, or
          lawmakers frequently change. If the changes are so great that the
          development team can’t keep up with them, they can become paralyzed,
          unable to make meaningful progress. Agile development methods
          provide another way to deal with highly volatile requirements. These
          methods start by implementing a relatively solid portion of the
          requirements, knowing up front that changes will be made later.
          Teams then use customer feedback on the early increments to clarify
          the remaining product requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">A goal is not the same thing as an estimate. Anytime an
          imposed deadline and a thoughtfully estimated schedule don’t agree,
          negotiation is in order. A project manager who can justify an
          estimate based on a well-thought-out process and historical data is
          in a better bargaining position than someone who simply makes her
          best guess. The project’s business objectives should guide
          stakeholders to resolve the schedule conflict by stretching
          timelines, reducing scope, adding resources, or compromising on
          quality. These decisions aren’t easy, but making them is the only
          way to maximize the delivered product value.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3161" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Got an hour?</div><p class="calibre3">A customer once asked our software group to adapt a small
            program that he had written for his personal use so that his
            colleagues could also access it on our network. “Got an hour?” my
            manager asked me, giving his top-of-the-head assessment of the
            project’s size. When I spoke with the customer and his colleagues
            to understand what they really had in mind, the problem turned out
            to be a bit larger. I spent 100 hours writing the program they
            were looking for. The 100-fold expansion factor suggested that my
            manager’s initial estimate of one hour was a trifle hasty. The
            team should perform a preliminary exploration of requirements,
            evaluate scope, and judge the product size
            <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">before</em></span> anyone makes estimates or
            commitments.</p></div><p class="calibre3">Uncertain requirements lead to uncertain estimates. Because
          requirements uncertainty is unavoidable early in the project and
          because estimates are usually optimistic, include contingency
          buffers in your schedule and budget to accommodate some requirements
          growth (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-57">[ref248]</a>). Scope growth takes place because
          business needs change, users and markets shift, and stakeholders
          reach a better understanding of what the software can or should do.
          On agile projects, scope growth typically leads to adding more
          iterations to the development cycle. Extensive requirements growth,
          however, often indicates that many requirements were missed during
          elicitation.</p><div class="note" title="Important"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3162" class="calibre"></a>Important</h3><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-991" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1747" class="calibre"></a>Don’t let your estimates be swayed by what you think
            someone else wants to hear. Your prediction of the future
            shouldn’t change just because someone doesn’t like it. Too large a
            mismatch in predictions indicates the need for negotiation,
            though.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Requirements and scheduling"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3163">Requirements and scheduling</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Many projects practice “right-to-left scheduling”: a delivery
          date is cast in concrete and then the product’s requirements are
          defined. In such cases, it often proves impossible to meet the
          specified ship date while including all the demanded functionality
          at the expected quality level. It’s more realistic to define the
          software requirements <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">before</em></span> making detailed
          plans and commitments. A design-to-schedule strategy can work if the
          project manager can negotiate what portion of the desired
          functionality can fit within the schedule constraints. Requirements
          prioritization is a key success factor.</p><p class="calibre3">For complex systems in which software is only a part of the
          final product, project managers generally establish high-level
          schedules after developing the product-level (system) requirements
          and a preliminary architecture. At this point, the key delivery
          dates can be established, based on input from sources including
          marketing, sales, customer service, and development.</p><p class="calibre3">Consider planning and funding the project in stages. An
          initial requirements exploration stage will provide enough
          information to let you make realistic plans and estimates for one or
          more construction stages. Projects that have uncertain requirements
          benefit from incremental and iterative development approaches.
          Incremental development lets the team begin delivering useful
          software long before the requirements become fully clear.
          Prioritization of requirements dictates the functionality to include
          in each construction timebox.</p><p class="calibre3">Software projects frequently fail to meet their goals because
          the developers and other project participants are optimistic
          estimators and poor planners, not because they’re poor software
          engineers. Typical planning mistakes include overlooking common
          tasks, underestimating effort or time, failing to account for
          project risks, and not anticipating rework (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-362">[ref168]</a>). Effective project scheduling requires the

        sharp line but a gray, fuzzy area (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>). Try to
        keep requirements free from implementation bias, except when there’s a
        compelling reason to intentionally constrain the design. Ideally, the
        descriptions of what the system is intended to do should not be
        slanted by design considerations. Practically speaking, though,
        projects often possess design constraints from prior products, product
        line standards, and user interface conventions. Because of this, a
        requirements specification almost always contains some design
        information. Try to avoid <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">inadvertent</em></span> design,
        needless or unintended restrictions on the design. Include designers
        in requirements reviews to make sure the requirements can serve as a
        solid foundation for design.</p><div class="book" title="Architecture and allocation"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3166">Architecture and allocation</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">A product’s functionality, quality attributes, and constraints
          drive its architecture design (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-266">[ref012]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-364">[ref208]</a>). Analyzing a proposed architecture helps the
          analyst to verify the requirements and tune their precision, as does
          prototyping. Both methods use the following thought process: “If I
          understand the requirements correctly, this approach I’m reviewing
          is a good way to satisfy them. Now that I have a preliminary
          architecture (or a prototype) in hand, does it help me better
          understand the requirements and spot incorrect, missing, or
          conflicting requirements?”</p><p class="calibre3">Architecture is especially critical for systems that include
          both software and hardware components and for complex software-only
          systems. An essential step is to allocate the high-level system
          requirements to the various subsystems and components. An analyst,
          system engineer, or architect decomposes the system requirements
          into functional requirements for both software and hardware
          subsystems. Requirements trace information lets the development team
          track where each requirement is addressed in the design.</p><p class="calibre3">Inappropriate allocation decisions can result in the software
          being expected to perform functions that should have been assigned
          to hardware components (or the reverse), in poor performance, or in
          the inability to replace one component easily with an improved
          version. On one project, the hardware engineer blatantly told my
          group that he expected our software to overcome all limitations of
          his hardware design! Although software is more malleable than
          hardware, engineers shouldn’t use that flexibility as a reason to
          skimp on hardware design. Take a systems engineering approach to
          decide which capabilities each system component should
          deliver.</p><p class="calibre3">Allocation of system capabilities to subsystems and components
          must be done from the top down (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-226">[ref110]</a>). Consider
          a Blu-ray Disc player. As illustrated in <a class="xref" title="Figure 19-3. Complex products such as Blu-ray Disc players contain multiple software and hardware subsystems." href="#calibre_link-365">Figure&nbsp;19-3</a>, it includes
          motors to open and close the disc tray and to spin the disc, an
          optical subsystem to read the data on the disc, an image-rendering
          subsystem, a multifunction remote control, and more. The subsystems
          interact to control the behavior that results when, say, the user
          presses a button on the remote control to open the disc tray while
          the disc is playing. The system requirements drive the architecture
          design for such complex products, and the architecture influences
          the requirements allocation.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-365" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3167" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000081.jpeg" alt="Complex products such as Blu-ray Disc players contain multiple software and hardware subsystems." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;19-3.&nbsp;Complex products such as Blu-ray Disc players contain

            behavior of a photographic system with eight computational
            processes. After working hard on requirements analysis, the team
            was eager to start coding. Instead, we took the time to create a
            design model to think about how we’d build a solution. We quickly
            realized that three of the steps in the photographic simulation
            used identical computational algorithms, three more used another
            set, and the remaining two shared a third set. The design
            perspective simplified the problem from eight sets of complex
            calculations to just three. Had we skipped design, we likely would
            have noticed the code repetition at some point, but we saved a lot
            of time by detecting these simplifications early on. It’s more
            efficient to revise design models than to rewrite code.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Software design"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3169">Software design</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Software design receives short shrift on some projects, yet
          the time spent on design is an excellent investment. A variety of
          software designs will satisfy most products’ requirements. These
          designs will vary in their performance, efficiency, robustness, and
          the technical methods employed. If you leap directly from
          requirements into code, you’re essentially designing the software
          mentally and on the fly. You come up with <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">a</em></span>
          design but not necessarily with <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">an excellent</em></span>
          design. Poorly structured software is the likely result.</p><p class="calibre3">As with requirements, excellent designs result from iteration.
          Make multiple passes through the design to refine your initial
          concepts as you gain information and generate additional ideas.
          Shortcomings in design lead to products that are difficult to
          maintain and extend and that don’t satisfy the customer’s
          performance, usability, and reliability objectives. The time you
          spend translating requirements into designs is an excellent
          investment in building high-quality, robust products.</p><p class="calibre3">A project that’s applying object-oriented development methods
          might begin with object-oriented analysis of requirements, using
          class diagrams and other UML models to represent and analyze
          requirements information. A designer can elaborate these conceptual
          class diagrams, which are free of implementation specifics, into
          more detailed object models for design and implementation.</p><p class="calibre3">You needn’t develop a complete, detailed design for the entire
          product before you begin implementation, but you should design each
          component before you code it. Formal design is of most benefit to
          particularly difficult projects, projects involving systems with
          many internal component interfaces and interactions, and projects
          staffed with inexperienced developers (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-366">[ref166]</a>).

          resolution through the project’s issue-tracking process. If an issue
          can’t be resolved immediately, any assumptions, guesses, or
          interpretations that a developer makes should be documented and
          reviewed with customer representatives.</p></div><div class="book" title="User interface design"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3170">User interface design</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">User interface design is an extensively studied domain that

          UI design is so closely related to requirements that you shouldn’t
          just push it downstream to be done without end-user engagement.

        beautifully. As consultant <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-370">[ref098]</a> points out, “Good
        requirements engineering produces better tests; good test analysis
        produces better requirements.” The requirements provide the foundation
        for system testing. The product should be tested against what it was
        intended to do as recorded in the requirements documentation, not
        against its design or code. System testing that’s based on the code
        can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The product might correctly
        exhibit all the behaviors described in tests based on the code, but
        that doesn’t mean that it meets the customers’ needs. Include testers
        in requirements reviews to make sure the requirements are verifiable
        and can serve as the basis for system testing.</p><p class="calibre3">Agile development teams typically write acceptance tests in lieu
        of precise requirements (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-34">[ref043]</a>). Rather than
        specifying the capabilities the system must exhibit or the actions a
        user must be able to take, the acceptance tests flesh out the expected
        behavior of a user story. This conveys to developers the information
        they need to feel confident that they’ve correctly and completely
        implemented each story. As described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 17. Validating the requirements" href="#calibre_link-60">Chapter&nbsp;17</a> acceptance tests should
        cover:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Expected behavior under normal conditions (good input data
            and valid user actions).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">How anticipated error conditions and expected failure
            scenarios should be handled (bad input data or invalid user
            actions).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Whether quality expectations are satisfied (for example,
            response times, security protections, and the average time or
            number of user actions needed to accomplish a task).</p></li></ul></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3173" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">What to test?</div><p class="calibre3">A seminar attendee once said, “I’m in our system testing
          group. We don’t have written requirements, so we have to test what
          we think the software is supposed to do. Sometimes we’re wrong, so
          we have to ask the developers what the software does and test it
          again.”</p><p class="calibre3">Testing what the developers built isn’t the same as testing
          what they were <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">supposed</em></span> to build. The
          requirements are the ultimate reference for system and user
          acceptance testing. If the system has poorly specified requirements,
          the testers will discover many requirements that developers
          inferred&mdash;rightly or wrongly&mdash;and implemented. The analyst should
          document legitimate implied requirements and their origins to make
          future regression testing more effective.</p></div><p class="calibre3">The testers or quality assurance staff should determine how
        they’d verify the implementation of each requirement. Possible methods
        include:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Testing (executing the software to look for defects)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Inspection (examining the code to ensure that it satisfies
            the requirements)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Demonstration (showing that the product works as
            expected)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Analysis (reasoning through how the system should work under
            certain circumstances)</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Connecting testing back to requirements helps keep the testing
        effort prioritized and focused for maximum benefit. One colleague, a
        seasoned project manager and business analyst, related her experience
        along these lines: “A clearly articulated business need can drive user
        acceptance testing (UAT), which is typically the final hurdle a
        project undergoes prior to going live. On a recent web portal
        development project, we worked with the business sponsor to understand
        the real gains the web portal was expected to deliver. Understanding
        the critical requirements allowed the project manager to craft clear
        definitions of critical, moderate, and cosmetic defects. By tying
        defect criteria clearly to requirements, we guided our customers
        through UAT and successfully completed a major development effort
        without any ambiguity about quality or acceptance criteria.”</p><p class="calibre3">The simple act of thinking about how you’ll verify each
        requirement is a useful quality practice. Use analytical techniques
        such as cause-and-effect graphs to derive tests based on the logic
        described in a requirement. This will reveal ambiguities, missing or
        implied <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">else</em></span> conditions, and other problems. Each
        functional requirement should map to at least one test so that no
        expected system behavior goes unverified. Requirements-based testing
        applies several test design strategies: action-driven, data-driven
        (including boundary value analysis and equivalence class
        partitioning), logic-driven, event-driven, and state-driven (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-371">[ref191]</a>). Skillful testers will augment requirements-based
        testing with additional testing based on the product’s history,
        intended usage scenarios, overall quality characteristics, service
        level agreements, boundary conditions, and quirks.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-657" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1073" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1160" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1332" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1740" class="calibre"></a>The effort invested in early test thinking isn’t wasted,
        even if you plan a separate system testing effort before release. It’s
        a matter of reallocating test effort that historically was weighted
        toward the latter project stages. Conceptual tests are readily
        transformed into specific test scenarios and automated, where feasible
        and appropriate. Moving test thinking up earlier in the development
        cycle will pay off with better requirements, clear communication and
        common expectations among stakeholders, and early defect
        removal.</p><p class="calibre3">As development progresses, the team will elaborate the
        requirements from the high level found in user requirements, through
        the functional requirements, and ultimately down to specifications for
        individual code modules. Testing authority <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-372">[ref016]</a>
        points out that testing against requirements must be performed at
        every level of software construction, not just the end-user level.
        Some application code isn’t directly accessed by users but is needed
        for infrastructure operations. Each module must satisfy its own
        specification, even if that module’s function is invisible to the
        user. Consequently, testing the system against user requirements is a
        necessary&mdash;but not sufficient&mdash;strategy for system testing.</p></div><div class="book" title="From requirements to success"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3174">From requirements to success</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">I once encountered a project in which a contract development
        team came on board to implement a very large application for which an
        earlier team had developed the requirements. The new team took one
        look at the dozen three-inch binders of requirements, shuddered in
        horror, and began coding. They didn’t refer to the SRS during
        construction. Instead, they built what they thought they were supposed
        to build, based on an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of the
        project’s goals. Not surprisingly, this project encountered a lot of
        problems. Trying to understand a huge volume of even excellent
        requirements is certainly hard, but ignoring them is a decisive step
        toward project failure.</p><p class="calibre3">It’s faster to read the requirements, however extensive, before
        implementation than it is to build the wrong system and then have to
        build it again correctly. It’s even faster to engage the development
        team early in the project so that they can participate in the
        requirements work and perform early prototyping or take an iterative
        development approach. The development team still has to read the
        entire specification eventually. However, they are spreading their
        reading time across the project, which alleviates some of the tedious
        nature of the activity.</p><p class="calibre3">A more successful team had a practice of listing all the
        requirements that were planned for a specific release. The project’s
        quality assurance group evaluated each release by executing the tests
        for those requirements. A requirement that didn’t satisfy its test
        criteria was counted as a defect. The QA group rejected the release if
        more than a predetermined number of requirements weren’t met or if
        specific high-impact requirements weren’t satisfied. This project was
        successful largely because it used its documented requirements to
        decide when a release was shippable.</p><p class="calibre3">The ultimate deliverable from a software development project is
        a solution that meets the customers’ needs and expectations.
        Requirements are an essential step on the path from business need to
        satisfied customers. If you don’t base your project plans, designs,
        and acceptance and system tests on a foundation of high-quality
        requirements, you’re likely to waste a great deal of effort trying to
        deliver a solid product. Don’t become a slave to your requirements
        processes, though. There’s no point in spending time generating
        unnecessary documents and holding ritualized meetings. Strive for a
        sensible balance between rigorous specification and
        off-the-top-of-the-head coding that will reduce the risk of building
        the wrong product to an acceptable level.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3175" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Next steps</div><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Estimate the requirements work on your next project by

      development methods that encourage continuous collaboration among
      stakeholders and rapid and frequent delivery of small increments of
      useful functionality. There are many different types of agile methods;
      some of the most popular are Scrum, Extreme Programming, Lean Software
      Development, Feature-Driven Development, and Kanban. The term “agile
      development” has gained popularity since the publication of the
      “Manifesto for Agile Software Development” (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-377">[ref015]</a>).
      Agile methods are based on iterative and incremental approaches to
      software development, which have been around for many years (for
      example, see <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-378">[ref020]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-204">[ref083]</a>; and
      <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-379">[ref149]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3">The agile development approaches have characteristics that
      distinguish them from one another, but they all fundamentally champion
      an adaptive (sometimes called “change-driven”) approach over a
      predictive (sometimes called “plan-driven”) approach (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-91">[ref024]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-44">[ref115]</a>). A predictive approach,
      such as waterfall development, attempts to minimize the amount of risk
      in a project by doing extensive planning and documentation prior to
      initiating construction of the software. The project managers and
      business analysts make sure that all stakeholders understand exactly
      what will be delivered before it gets built. This can work well if the
      requirements are well understood at the outset and are likely to remain
      relatively stable during the project. Adaptive approaches such as agile
      methods are designed to accommodate the inevitable change that takes
      place on projects. They also work well for projects with highly
      uncertain or volatile requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">This chapter describes the characteristics of agile approaches as
      they relate to the requirements activities for a software project, the
      major adaptations of traditional requirements practices for an agile
      project, and a road map of where to find more detailed guidance
      throughout the rest of the book.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3178" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Agile requirements?</div><p class="calibre3">We do not use the term “agile requirements,” because that
        implies that the requirements for an agile project are somehow
        qualitatively different from those for projects following other life
        cycles. Developers need to know the same information to be able to
        correctly implement the right functionality in the right way on all
        projects. However, agile and traditional projects do handle
        requirements differently in various respects, particularly with regard
        to the timing and depth of requirements activities and the extent of
        written requirements documentation. This is why we use the term
        “requirements for agile projects.”</p></div><div class="book" title="Limitations of the waterfall"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3179">Limitations of the waterfall</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2063" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2550" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2552" class="calibre"></a>Organizations often think of a waterfall development
        process as involving a linear sequence of activities, where project
        teams fully specify (and sometimes overspecify) the requirements, then
        create designs, then write code, and finally test the solution. In
        theory, this approach has several advantages. The team can catch any
        flaws in the application’s requirements and design early on rather
        than during construction, testing, or maintenance, when fixing an
        error is much more costly. If the requirements are correct up front,
        it is easy to allocate budget and resources, to measure progress, and
        to estimate an accurate completion date. However, in practice,
        software development is rarely that straightforward.</p><p class="calibre3">Few projects follow a purely sequential waterfall approach. Even
        predictive projects expect a certain amount of change and put
        mechanisms in place to handle it. There is always some overlap and
        feedback between the phases. In general, though, on waterfall
        development projects the team puts considerable effort into trying to
        get the full requirements set “right” early on. There are many
        possible software development life cycles in addition to waterfall and
        agile approaches. They place varying degrees of emphasis on developing
        a complete set of requirements early in the project (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-295">[ref164]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-91">[ref024]</a>). A key differentiator
        across the spectrum between totally fixed, predictive projects and
        totally uncertain, adaptive projects is the amount of time that
        elapses between when a requirement is created and when software based
        on that requirement is delivered to customers.</p><p class="calibre3">Large projects that use a waterfall approach are often delivered
        late, lack necessary features, and fail to meet users’ expectations.
        Waterfall projects are susceptible to this kind of failure because of
        the layers of dependency built upon the requirements. Stakeholders
        often change their requirements during the course of a long project,
        and projects struggle when the software development teams cannot
        respond to these changes effectively. The reality is that stakeholders
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">will</em></span> change requirements&mdash;because they don’t know
        precisely what they want at the beginning of the project, because
        sometimes they can articulate their vision only after they see
        something that clearly doesn’t match their vision, and because
        business needs sometimes change during the course of a project.</p><p class="calibre3">Although <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-380">[ref207]</a> is often credited with being
        the first to publish the formal waterfall model (though not by that
        name), he actually presented it in the context of being an approach
        that is “risky and invites failure.” He identified the exact problem
        that projects today still experience: errors in requirements likely
        aren’t caught until testing, late in the project. He went on to
        explain that the steps <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">ideally</em></span> should be
        performed in the sequence of requirements, design, code, and test, but
        that projects <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">really</em></span> need to overlap some of
        these phases and iterate between them. Royce even proposed using
        simulations to prototype the requirements and designs as an experiment
        before committing to the full development effort. Modified waterfalls,
        though, are followed by many projects today, with varying degrees of
        success.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3180" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Disruptive changes to business objectives</div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-578" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1426" class="calibre"></a>A year into a large waterfall project, a new director
          of marketing took over as the executive sponsor. The team had
          already developed a lot of software, but they had not yet deployed
          anything that was useful to customers. Not surprisingly, the new
          sponsor had different business objectives than his predecessor. The
          business analysts shared the news with the development team that
          there were new business objectives, and consequently new user
          requirements, new functional requirements, and revised priorities on
          the old requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">The development team had become accustomed to allocating all
          new requirements to a planned enhancement phase following the
          initial deployment. They lashed out, protesting that it was
          unacceptable to change course in the middle of the project. However,
          to continue to develop and deliver a product that fulfilled only the
          original requirements would have left the new sponsor dissatisfied.
          Had the team been using a development approach that anticipated and
          accommodated requirements changes, this shift in strategic direction
          would have been far less disruptive.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="The agile development approach"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3181">The agile development approach</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Agile development methods attempt to address some limitations of
        the waterfall model. Agile methods focus on iterative and incremental
        development, breaking the development of software into short cycles
        called iterations (or, in the agile method known as Scrum, “sprints”).
        Iterations can be as short as one week or as long as a month. During
        each iteration, the development team adds a small set of functionality
        based on priorities established by the customer, tests it to make sure
        it works properly, and validates it with acceptance criteria
        established by the customer. Subsequent increments modify what already
        exists, enrich the initial features, add new ones, and correct defects
        that were discovered. Ongoing customer participation enables the team
        to spot problems and changes in direction early, thereby guiding
        developers to adjust their course before they are too far down the
        wrong path. The goal is to have a body of potentially shippable
        software at the end of each iteration, even if it constitutes just a
        small portion of the ultimately desired product.</p></div><div class="book" title="Essential aspects of an agile approach to requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3182">Essential aspects of an agile approach to requirements</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The following sections describe several differences in the ways
        that agile projects and traditional projects approach requirements.

          projects always increases the chances of project success. This is
          true for waterfall projects as well as for agile projects. The main
          difference between the two approaches is in the timing of the
          customer involvement. On waterfall projects, customers typically
          dedicate considerable time up front, helping the BA understand,
          document, and validate requirements. Customers should also be
          involved later in the project during user acceptance testing,
          providing feedback on whether the product meets their needs.
          However, during the construction phase, there is generally little
          customer involvement, which makes it difficult for a project to
          adapt to changing customer needs.</p><p class="calibre3">On agile projects, customers (or a product owner who
          represents them) are engaged continuously throughout the project.
          During an initial planning iteration on some agile projects,
          customers work with the project team to identify and prioritize user
          stories that will serve as the preliminary road map for the
          development of the product. Because user stories are typically less
          detailed than traditional functional requirements, customers must be
          available during iterations to provide input and clarification
          during the design and construction activities. They should also test
          and provide feedback on the newly developed features when the
          construction phase of the iteration is complete.</p><p class="calibre3">It is common to have product owners, customers, and end users
          participate in writing user stories or other requirements, but these
          individuals might not all be trained in effective requirements
          methods. Inexpertly written user stories are likely not sufficient
          for clear communication of requirements. Regardless of who is
          writing the user stories, someone with solid business analysis
          skills should review and edit the stories before the team begins
          implementing them. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 6. Finding the voice of the user" href="#calibre_link-61">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>
          further elaborates on customer involvement on agile projects.</p></div><div class="book" title="Documentation detail"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3184">Documentation detail</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Because developers have little interaction with customers
          after construction begins on waterfall projects, the requirements
          must specify system behavior, data relationships, and user
          experience expectations in considerable detail. The close
          collaboration of customers with developers on agile projects
          generally means that requirements can be documented in less detail
          than on traditional projects. Instead, BAs or other people
          responsible for requirements will develop the necessary precision
          through conversations and documentation when it is needed (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-381">[ref118]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3">People sometimes think that agile project teams are not
          supposed to write requirements. That is not accurate. Instead, agile
          methods encourage creating the minimum amount of documentation
          needed to accurately guide the developers and testers. Any
          documentation beyond what the development and test teams need (or
          that is required to satisfy regulations or standards) represents
          wasted effort. Certain user stories might have little detail
          provided, with only the riskiest or highest-impact functionality
          being specified in more detail, typically in the form of acceptance
          tests.</p></div><div class="book" title="The backlog and prioritization"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3185">The backlog and prioritization</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-564" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-579" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-581" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-582" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-639" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1677" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1703" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1966" class="calibre"></a>The product backlog on an agile project contains a
          list of requests for work that the team might perform (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-381">[ref118]</a>). Product backlogs typically are composed of
          user stories, but some teams also populate the backlog with other
          requirements, business processes, and defects to be corrected. Each
          project should maintain only one backlog (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-104">[ref045]</a>). Therefore, defects might need to be
          represented in the backlog for prioritization against new user
          stories. Some teams rewrite defects as new user stories or variants
          of old stories. Backlogs can be maintained on story cards or in
          tools. Agile purists might insist on using cards, but they are not
          practical for large projects or distributed teams. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 27. Requirements management practices" href="#calibre_link-89">Chapter&nbsp;27</a> discusses the product
          backlog in more detail. Various tools for agile project management,
          including backlog management, are commercially available.</p><p class="calibre3">Prioritization of the backlog is an ongoing activity to select
          which work items go into upcoming iterations and which items are
          discarded from the backlog. The priorities assigned to backlog items
          don’t have to remain constant forever, just for the next iteration
          (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-93">[ref157]</a>). Tracing items in the backlog back to
          the business requirements facilitates prioritization. All projects,
          not just agile projects, ought to be managing priorities of the work
          remaining in their backlog.</p></div><div class="book" title="Timing"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3186">Timing</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Agile projects require fundamentally the same types of
          requirements activities as traditional development projects. Someone
          still needs to elicit requirements from user representatives,
          analyze them, document requirements of various kinds at appropriate
          levels of detail, and validate that the requirements will achieve
          the business objectives for the project. However, detailed
          requirements are not documented all at once at the beginning of an
          agile project. Instead, high-level requirements, typically in the
          form of user stories, are elicited to populate a product backlog
          early in a project for planning and prioritization.</p><p class="calibre3">As shown in <a class="xref" title="Figure 20-1. Standard requirements activities occur within each agile iteration." href="#calibre_link-382">Figure&nbsp;20-1</a>, user stories
          are allocated to specific iterations for implementation, and the
          details for each story are further clarified during that iteration.
          As was illustrated in <a class="xref" title="Figure 3-3. The distribution of requirements development effort over time varies for projects that follow different development life cycles." href="#calibre_link-80">Figure&nbsp;3-3</a> in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 3. Good practices for requirements engineering" href="#calibre_link-6">Chapter&nbsp;3</a> requirements
          might be developed in small portions throughout the entire project,
          even up until shortly before the product is released. However, it’s
          important to learn about nonfunctional requirements early on so the
          system’s architecture can be designed to achieve critical
          performance, usability, availability, and other quality
          goals.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-382" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3187" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000083.jpeg" alt="An illustration showing a product backlog at the top                 represented by a rectangular box.

          concise statement that articulates something a user needs and serves
          as a starting point for conversations to flesh out the details. User
          stories were created specifically to address the needs of agile
          developers. You might prefer to employ use case names, features, or
          process flows when exploring user requirements. The form you choose
          to describe these sorts of requirements is not important; this
          chapter primarily refers to them as user stories because they are so
          commonly used on agile projects.</p><p class="calibre3">User stories are sized so as to be fully implementable in a
          single iteration. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-104">[ref045]</a> defines an
          <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">epic</em></span> as being a user story that is too large to
          fully implement in a single iteration. Because epics span
          iterations, they must be split into sets of smaller stories.
          Sometimes epics are large enough that they must be subdivided into
          multiple epics, each of which is then split into multiple stories
          until each resulting story can be reliably estimated and then
          implemented and tested within a single iteration (see <a class="xref" title="Figure 20-2. Epics can be subdivided into smaller epics and then into user stories." href="#calibre_link-383">Figure&nbsp;20-2</a>). Breaking
          epics down into smaller epics and then into user stories is often
          referred to as <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">story decomposition</em></span> (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-381">[ref118]</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-383" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3190" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000084.jpeg" alt="An illustration showing a three-layer diagram.

          provides value to a user. In the context of an agile project,
          features could encompass an individual user story, multiple user
          stories, an individual epic, or multiple epics. For example, a zoom
          feature on a phone’s camera might be developed to enable execution
          of the following two unrelated user stories:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">As a mother, I want to take recognizable pictures of my
              daughter during school performances so that I can share them

              photographs of birds from a distance so that I can identify
              them.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Identifying the lowest level of stories that still aligns with
          the business requirements allows you to determine the smallest set
          of functionality that the team can deliver that provides value to
          the customer. This concept is often called a
          <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">minimum</em></span> (or minimal, or minimally)

            about whether the thing is called a story, an epic, or a feature,
            and focus more on developing high-quality requirements that will
            guide the developer’s ability to satisfy customer needs.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Expect change"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3192">Expect change</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Organizations know that change will happen on projects. Even
          business objectives can change. The biggest adaptation that BAs need
          to make when a requirement change arises on an agile project is to
          say not, “Wait, that’s out of scope” or “We need to go through a
          formal process to incorporate that change,” but rather, “Okay, let’s
          talk about the change.” This encourages customer collaboration to
          create or change user stories and prioritize each change request
          against everything else that’s already in the backlog. As with all
          projects, agile project teams need to manage changes thoughtfully to
          reduce their negative impact, but they anticipate and even embrace
          the reality of change. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 28. Change happens" href="#calibre_link-72">Chapter&nbsp;28</a> for
          more information about managing requirements change on agile
          projects.</p><p class="calibre3">Knowing that you can handle changes doesn’t mean you should
          blindly ignore the future and pay attention only to what’s known
          now. It is still important to look ahead and see what might be
          coming farther down the road. The developers might not design for
          every possible future requirement. Given some glimpse of the future,
          though, they can create a more expandable and robust architecture or
          design hooks to make it easy to add new functionality.</p><p class="calibre3">Change also includes removing items from scope. Items can be
          removed from an iteration’s scope for various reasons, including the
          following:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Implementation issues prevent an item from being completed
              within the current time frame.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Issues discovered by product owners or during testing make
              the implementation of a particular story unacceptable.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Higher-priority items need to replace less important ones

        easily be adapted to agile projects, perhaps by altering the timing

        performs each practice. The International Institute of Business
        Analysis (IIBA) provides detailed suggestions regarding business
        analysis techniques to apply to agile projects (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-381">[ref118]</a>). Many other chapters in this book address how to

        methods, don’t worry: most of the practices you already use will still
        apply. After all, both agile and traditional project teams need to
        understand the requirements for the solutions they build. Following
        are a few suggestions to help you make the conversion to an agile
        approach:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Determine what your role is on the team. As described in
            <a class="xref" title="Chapter 4. The business analyst" href="#calibre_link-7">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>, some agile projects have
            a dedicated BA, whereas others have people with different titles
            who perform business analysis activities. Encourage all team
            members to focus on the goals of the project, not their individual
            roles or titles (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-386">[ref091]</a>).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-588" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1716" class="calibre"></a>Read a book on the agile product owner role so you
            understand user stories, acceptance tests, backlog prioritization,
            and why the agile BA is never “finished” until the end of the
            project or release. One suggested book is <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Agile Product
            Management with Scrum</em></span> (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-387">[ref185]</a>).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Identify suggested agile practices that will work best in
            your organization. Consider what has worked well already with
            other development approaches in your organization, and carry on
            those practices. Collaborate with the people currently performing
            other team roles to determine how their practices will work in an
            agile environment.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Implement a small project first as a pilot for agile
            methods, or implement only a few agile practices on your next
            project.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">If you decide to implement a hybrid model that adopts some
            agile practices but not others, select a few low-risk practices
            that can work well in any methodology to start. If you are new to
            agile, bring in an experienced coach for three or four iterations
            to help you avoid the temptation to revert to the historical
            practices with which you are comfortable.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Don’t be an agile purist just for the sake of being a
            purist.</p></li></ul></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3195" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Be agile when adopting agile practices</div><p class="calibre3">One organization I worked with decided to move from a
          traditional approach to agile development. The entire organization
          jumped in feet first, dogmatically trying to adapt agile practices
          across the entire organization at once. Many of the developers tried
          to be agile purists, writing story cards and incorrectly insisting
          that no other documentation was allowed.</p><p class="calibre3">This attempted implementation of agile approaches failed
          miserably. Not all of the stakeholders bought into the effort. Some
          of the practices the developers insisted on didn’t scale up to their
          large projects. The customers didn’t know how their role would be
          different on an agile project. The new projects failed so badly that
          the IT executive mandated that agile development must stop
          immediately. All projects would follow a waterfall model from that
          point forward. “Agile” became a bad word. This was like trying to
          fix one poor decision with another!</p><p class="calibre3">Something interesting happened in the IT organization. The
          development teams knew this mandate was also going to lead to
          disaster, so they adopted a hybrid development approach. They used
          backlogs to prioritize requirements, they developed in three-week
          iterations, and they specified detailed requirements just-in-time
          for each iteration. When the teams described their approach to their
          management, they just said they were using “standard waterfall
          approaches” in their development so they wouldn’t get in trouble.
          Most of the agile practices actually worked well in their
          organization when they learned how to execute them properly. This
          organization initially tried to adopt agile methods in a way that
          didn’t work in their organization and ended up giving agile an
          undeserved bad name.</p></div></div></section></div>

<div class="calibre1" id="calibre_link-388"><section title="Chapter 21. Enhancement and replacement projects" type="chapter" id="calibre_link-3196"><div class="titlepage" id="calibre_link-18"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title1">Chapter&nbsp;21.&nbsp;Enhancement and replacement projects</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1141" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1346" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1908" class="calibre"></a>Most of this book describes requirements development as
      though you are beginning a new software or system development project,
      sometimes called a <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">green-field project</em></span>. However,
      many organizations devote much of their effort to enhancing or replacing
      existing information systems or building new releases of established
      commercial products. Most of the practices described in this book are
      appropriate for enhancement and replacement projects. This chapter
      provides specific suggestions as to which practices are most relevant
      and how to use them.</p><p class="calibre3">An <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">enhancement project</em></span> is one in which new
      capabilities are added to an existing system. Enhancement projects might
      also involve correcting defects, adding new reports, and modifying
      functionality to comply with revised business rules or needs.</p><p class="calibre3">A <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">replacement</em></span> (or
      <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">reengineering</em></span>) <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">project</em></span>
      replaces an existing application with a new custom-built system, a
      commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) system, or a hybrid of those.
      Replacement projects are most commonly implemented to improve
      performance, cut costs (such as maintenance costs or license fees), take
      advantage of modern technologies, or meet regulatory requirements. If
      your replacement project will involve a COTS solution, the guidance
      presented in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 22. Packaged solution projects" href="#calibre_link-24">Chapter&nbsp;22</a> will also be
      helpful.</p><p class="calibre3">Replacement and enhancement projects face some particular
      requirements issues. The original developers who held all the critical
      information in their heads might be long gone. It’s tempting to claim
      that a small enhancement doesn’t warrant writing any requirements.
      Developers might believe that they don’t need detailed requirements if
      they are replacing an existing system’s functionality. The approaches
      described in this chapter can help you to deal with the challenges of
      enhancing or replacing an existing system to improve its ability to meet
      the organization’s current business needs.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3197" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">The case of the missing spec</div><p class="calibre3">The requirements specification for the next release of a mature
        system often says, essentially, “The new system should do everything
        the old system does, except add these new features and fix those
        bugs.” A business analyst once received just such a specification for
        version 5 of a major product. To find out exactly what the current
        release did, she looked at the SRS for version 4. Unfortunately, it
        also said, in essence, “Version 4 should do everything that version 3
        does, except add these new features and fix those bugs.” She followed
        the trail back, but every SRS described just the differences that the
        new version should exhibit compared to the previous version. Nowhere
        was there a description of the original system. Consequently, everyone
        had a different understanding of the current system’s capabilities. If
        you’re in this situation, document the requirements for your project
        more thoroughly so that all the stakeholders&mdash;both present and
        future&mdash;understand what the system does.</p></div><div class="book" title="Expected challenges"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3198">Expected challenges</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1143" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1910" class="calibre"></a>The presence of an existing system leads to common
        challenges that both enhancement and replacement projects will face,
        including the following:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The changes made could degrade the performance to which
            users are accustomed.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Little or no requirements documentation might be available
            for the existing system.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Users who are familiar with how the system works today might
            not like the changes they are about to encounter.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">You might unknowingly break or omit functionality that is
            vital to some stakeholder group.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Stakeholders might take this opportunity to request new
            functionality that seems like a good idea but isn’t really needed
            to meet the business objectives.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Even if there is existing documentation, it might not prove
        useful. For enhancement projects, the documentation might not be up to
        date. If the documentation doesn’t match the existing application’s
        reality, it is of limited use. For replacement systems, you also need
        to be wary of carrying forward <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">all</em></span> of the
        requirements, because some of the old functionality probably should
        not be migrated.</p><p class="calibre3">One of the major issues in replacement projects is validating
        that the reasons for the replacement are sound. There need to be
        justifiable business objectives for the change. When existing systems
        are being completely replaced, organizational processes might also
        have to change, which makes it harder for people to accept a new
        system. The change in business processes, change in the software
        system, and learning curve of a new system can disrupt current
        operations.</p></div><div class="book" title="Requirements techniques when there is an existing system"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3199">Requirements techniques when there is an existing

        requirements methods in a small-scale and low-risk way. The pressure
        to get the next release out might make you think that you don’t have
        time to experiment with requirements techniques, but enhancement
        projects let you tackle the learning curve in bite-sized chunks. When
        the next big project comes along, you’ll have some experience and
        confidence in better requirements practices.</p><p class="calibre3">Suppose that a customer requests that a new feature be added to
        a mature product. If you haven’t worked with user stories before,
        explore the new feature from the user-story perspective, discussing
        with the requester the tasks that users will perform with that
        feature. Practicing on this project reduces the risk compared to
        applying user stories for the first time on a green-field project,
        when your skill might mean the difference between success and
        high-profile failure.</p></div><div class="book" title="Prioritizing by using business objectives"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3201">Prioritizing by using business objectives</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1142" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1241" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1289" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1308" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1679" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1764" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1909" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2087" class="calibre"></a>Enhancement projects are undertaken to add new
        capabilities to an existing application. It’s easy to get caught up in
        the excitement and start adding unnecessary capabilities. To combat
        this risk of gold-plating, trace requirements back to business
        objectives to ensure that the new features are needed and to select
        the highest-impact features to implement first. You also might need to
        prioritize enhancement requests against the correction of defects that
        had been reported against the old system.</p><p class="calibre3">Also be wary of letting unnecessary new functionality slip into
        replacement projects. The main focus of replacement projects is to
        migrate existing functionality. However, customers might imagine that
        if you are developing a new system anyway, it is easy to add lots of
        new capabilities right away. Many replacement projects have collapsed
        because of the weight of uncontrolled scope growth. You’re usually
        better off building a stable first release and adding more features
        through subsequent enhancement projects, provided the first release
        allows users to do their jobs.</p><p class="calibre3">Replacement projects often originate when stakeholders want to
        add functionality to an existing system that is too inflexible to
        support the growth or has technology limitations. However, there needs
        to be a clear business objective to justify implementing an expensive
        new system (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-390">[ref063]</a>). Use the anticipated cost
        savings from a new system (such as through reduced maintenance of an
        old, clunky system) plus the value of the new desired functionality to
        justify a system replacement project.</p><p class="calibre3">Also look for existing functionality that doesn’t need to be
        retained in a replacement system. Don’t replicate the existing
        system’s shortcomings or miss an opportunity to update a system to
        suit new business needs and processes. For example, the BA might ask
        users, “Do you use &lt;<span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">a particular menu
        option</em></span>&gt;?” If you consistently hear “I never do that,”
        then maybe it isn’t needed in the replacement system. Look for usage
        data that shows what screens, functions, or data entities are rarely
        accessed in the current system. Even the existing functionality has to
        map to current and anticipated business objectives to warrant
        re-implementing it in the new system.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3202" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Don’t let stakeholders get away with saying “I have it today,
          so I need it in the new system” as a default method of justifying
          requirements.</p></div><div class="book" title="Mind the gap"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3203">Mind the gap</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">A <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">gap analysis</em></span> is a comparison of
          functionality between an existing system and a desired new system. A
          gap analysis can be expressed in different ways, including use
          cases, user stories, or features. When enhancing an existing system,
          perform a gap analysis to make sure you understand why it isn’t
          currently meeting your business objectives.</p><p class="calibre3">Gap analysis for a replacement project entails understanding
          existing functionality and discovering the desired new functionality
          (see <a class="xref" title="Figure 21-1. When you are replacing an existing system, some requirements will be implemented unchanged, some will be modified, some will be discarded, and some new requirements might be added." href="#calibre_link-251">Figure&nbsp;21-1</a>).
          Identify user requirements for the existing system that stakeholders
          want to have re-implemented in the new system. Also, elicit new user
          requirements that the existing system does not address. Consider any
          change requests that were never implemented in the existing system.
          Prioritize the existing user requirements and the new ones together.
          Prioritize closing the gaps using business objectives as described
          in the previous section or the other prioritization techniques

          and throughput. Stakeholders almost always have key performance
          indicators (KPIs) for existing processes that they will want to
          maintain in the new system. A key performance indicator model (KPIM)
          can help you identify and specify these metrics for their
          corresponding business processes (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-42">[ref013]</a>). The
          KPIM helps stakeholders see that even if the new system will be
          different, their business outcomes will be at least as good as
          before.</p><p class="calibre3">Unless you explicitly plan to maintain them, performance
          levels can be compromised as systems are enhanced. Stuffing new
          functionality into an existing system might slow it down. One data
          synchronization tool had a requirement to update a master data set
          from the day’s transactions. It needed to run every 24 hours. In the
          initial release of the tool, the synchronization started at midnight
          and took about one hour to execute. After some enhancements to
          include additional attributes, merging, and synchronicity checks,
          the synchronization took 20 hours to execute. This was a problem,
          because users expected to have fully synchronized data from the
          night before available when they started their workday at 8:00 A.M.
          The maximum time to complete the synchronization was never
          explicitly specified, but the stakeholders assumed it could be done
          overnight in less than eight hours.</p><p class="calibre3">For replacement systems, prioritize the KPIs that are most
          important to maintain. Look for the business processes that trace to
          the most important KPIs and the requirements that enable those
          business processes; these are the requirements to implement first.
          For instance, if you’re replacing a loan application system in which
          loan processors can enter 10 loans per day, it might be important to
          maintain at least that same throughput in the new system. The
          functionality that allows loan processers to enter loans should be
          some of the earliest implemented in the new system, so the loan
          processors can maintain their productivity.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="When old requirements don’t exist"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3206">When old requirements don’t exist</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1029" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1140" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1907" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2149" class="calibre"></a>Most older systems do not have documented&mdash;let alone
        accurate&mdash;requirements. In the absence of reliable documentation, teams
        might reverse-engineer an understanding of what the system does from
        the user interfaces, code, and database. We think of this as “software
        archaeology.” To maximize the benefit from reverse engineering, the
        archaeology expedition should record what it learns in the form of
        requirements and design descriptions. Accumulating accurate
        information about certain portions of the current system positions the
        team to enhance a system with low risk, to replace a system without
        missing critical functionality, and to perform future enhancements
        efficiently. It halts the knowledge drain, so future maintainers
        better understand the changes that were just made.</p><p class="calibre3">If updating the requirements is overly burdensome, it will fall
        by the wayside as busy people rush on to the next change request.
        Obsolete requirements aren’t helpful for future enhancements. There’s
        a widespread fear in the software industry that writing documentation
        will consume too much time; the knee-jerk reaction is to neglect all
        opportunities to update requirements documentation. But what’s the
        cost if you <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">don’t</em></span> update the requirements and a
        future maintainer (perhaps you!) has to regenerate that information?
        The answer to this question will let you make a thoughtful business
        decision concerning whether to revise the requirements documentation
        when you change or re-create the software.</p><p class="calibre3">When the team performs additional enhancements and maintenance
        over time, it can extend these fractional knowledge representations,
        steadily improving the system documentation. The incremental cost of
        recording this newly found knowledge is small compared with the cost
        of someone having to rediscover it later on. Implementing enhancements
        almost always necessitates further requirements development, so add
        those new requirements to an existing requirements repository, if
        there is one. If you’re replacing an old system, you have an
        opportunity to document the requirements for the new one and to keep
        the requirements up to date with what you learn throughout the
        project. Try to leave the requirements in better shape than you found
        them.</p><div class="book" title="Which requirements should you specify?"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3207">Which requirements should you specify?</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">It’s not always worth taking the time to generate a complete
          set of requirements for an entire production system. Many options
          lie between the two extremes of continuing forever with no
          requirements documentation and reconstructing a perfect requirements
          set. Knowing why you’d like to have written requirements available
          lets you judge whether the cost of rebuilding all&mdash;or even part&mdash;of
          the specification is a sound investment.</p><p class="calibre3">Perhaps your current system is a shapeless mass of history and
          mystery like the one in <a class="xref" title="Figure 21-2. Adding enhancement A to an ill-documented existing system provides some visibility into the B area." href="#calibre_link-391">Figure&nbsp;21-2</a>. Imagine that
          you’ve been asked to implement some new functionality in region A in
          this figure. Begin by recording the new requirements in a structured
          SRS or in a requirements management tool. When you add the new
          functionality, you’ll have to figure out how it interfaces to or
          fits in with the existing system. The bridges in <a class="xref" title="Figure 21-2. Adding enhancement A to an ill-documented existing system provides some visibility into the B area." href="#calibre_link-391">Figure&nbsp;21-2</a> between region
          A and your current system represent these interfaces. This analysis
          provides insight into the white portion of the current system,
          region B. In addition to the requirements for region A, this insight
          is the new knowledge you need to capture.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-391" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3208" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000086.jpeg" alt="An illustration showing box A with bridges into blob                 shape B labeled Your Current System.

          Focus detailed requirements efforts on the changes needed to meet
          the business objectives. If you’re replacing a system, start by
          documenting the areas prioritized as most important to achieve the
          business objectives or those that pose the highest implementation
          risk. Any new requirements identified during the gap analysis will
          need to be specified at the same level of precision and using the
          same techniques as you would for a new system.</p><div class="book" title="Level of detail"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-3209">Level of detail</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">One of the biggest challenges is determining the appropriate
            level of detail at which to document requirements gleaned from the
            existing system. For enhancements, defining requirements for the
            new functionality alone might be sufficient. However, you will
            usually benefit from documenting all of the functionality that
            closely relates to the enhancement, to ensure that the change fits
            in seamlessly (region B in <a class="xref" title="Figure 20-2. Epics can be subdivided into smaller epics and then into user stories." href="#calibre_link-383">Figure&nbsp;20-2</a>). You might
            want to create business processes, user requirements, and/or
            functional requirements for those related areas. For example,
            let’s say you are adding a discount code feature to an existing
            shopping cart function, but you don’t have any documented
            requirements for the shopping cart. You might be tempted to write
            just a single user story: “As a customer, I need to be able to
            enter a discount code so I can get the cheapest price for the
            product.” However, this user story alone lacks context, so
            consider capturing other user stories about shopping cart
            operations. That information could be valuable the next time you
            need to modify the shopping cart function.</p><p class="calibre3">I worked with one team that was just beginning to develop
            the requirements for version 2 of a major product with embedded
            software. They hadn’t done a good job on the requirements for
            version 1, which was currently being implemented. The lead BA
            wondered, “Is it worth going back to improve the SRS for version
            1?” The company anticipated that this product line would be a
            major revenue generator for at least 10 years. They also planned
            to reuse some of the core requirements in several spin-off
            products. In this case, it made sense to improve the requirements
            documentation for version 1 because it was the foundation for all
            subsequent development work in this product line. Had they been
            working on version 5.3 of a well-worn system that they expected to
            retire within a year, reconstructing a comprehensive set of
            requirements wouldn’t have been a wise investment.</p></div><div class="book" title="Trace Data"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-3210">Trace Data</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-890" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-942" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-957" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1011" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1149" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1393" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1527" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2228" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2283" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2336" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2386" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2454" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2462" class="calibre"></a>Requirements trace data for existing systems will
            help the enhancement developer determine which components she
            might have to modify because of a change in a specific
            requirement. In an ideal world, when you’re replacing a system,
            the existing system would have a full set of functional
            requirements such that you could establish traceability between
            the old and new systems to avoid overlooking any requirements.
            However, a poorly documented old system won’t have trace
            information available, and establishing rigorous traceability for
            both existing and new systems is time consuming.</p><p class="calibre3">As with any new development, it’s a good practice to create
            a traceability matrix to link the new or changed requirements to
            the corresponding design elements, code, and test cases.
            Accumulating trace links as you perform the development work takes
            little effort, whereas it’s a great deal of work to regenerate the
            links from a completed system. For replacement systems, perform
            requirements tracing at a high level: make a list of features and
            user stories for the existing system and prioritize to determine
            which of those will be implemented in the new system. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 29. Links in the requirements chain" href="#calibre_link-13">Chapter&nbsp;29</a> for more information
            on tracing requirements.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="How to discover the requirements of an existing system"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3211">How to discover the requirements of an existing
          system</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">In enhancement and replacement projects, even if you don’t
          have existing documentation, you do have a system to work from to
          discover the relevant requirements. During enhancement projects,
          consider drawing a dialog map for the new screens you have to add,
          showing the navigation connections to and from existing display
          elements. You might write use cases or user stories that span the
          new and existing functionality.</p><p class="calibre3">In replacement system projects, you need to understand all of
          the desired functionality, just as you do on any new development
          project. Study the user interface of the existing system to identify
          candidate functionality for the new system. Examine existing system
          interfaces to determine what data is exchanged between systems
          today. Understand how users use the current system. If no one
          understands the functionality and business rules behind the user
          interface, someone will need to look at the code or database to
          understand what’s going on. Analyze any documentation that does
          exist&mdash;design documents, help screens, user manuals, training
          materials&mdash;to identify requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">You might not need to specify functional requirements for the
          existing system at all, instead creating models to fill the
          information void. Swimlane diagrams can describe how users do their
          jobs with the system today. Context diagrams, data flow diagrams,
          and entity-relationship diagrams are also useful. You might create
          user requirements, specifying them only at a high level without
          filling in all of the details. Another way to begin closing the
          information gap is to create data dictionary entries when you add
          new data elements to the system and modify existing definitions. The
          test suite might be useful as an initial source of information to
          recover the software requirements, because tests represent an
          alternative view of requirements.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3212" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Sometimes “good enough” is enough</div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-843" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1138" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1905" class="calibre"></a>A third-party assessment of current business

            through a series of enhancement releases. The BAs did create
            requirements for each enhancement project. However, they did not
            merge all of those revisions back into the requirements baseline.
            The organization’s manager couldn’t think of a measurable benefit
            from keeping the existing documentation 100 percent updated to
            reflect the implemented systems. He assumed that his requirements
            always reflected only 80 to 90 percent of the working software
            anyway, so there was little value in trying to perfect the
            requirements for an enhancement. This meant that future
            enhancement project teams would have to work with some uncertainty
            and close the gaps when needed, but that price was deemed
            acceptable.</p></div></div></div><div class="book" title="Encouraging new system adoption"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3213">Encouraging new system adoption</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">You’re bound to run into resistance when changing or replacing
        an existing system. People are naturally reluctant to change.
        Introducing a new feature that will make users’ jobs easier is a good
        thing. But users are accustomed to how the system works today, and you
        plan to modify that, which is not so good from the user’s point of
        view. The issue is even bigger when you’re replacing a system, because
        now you’re changing more than just a bit of functionality. You’re
        potentially changing the entire application’s look and feel, its
        menus, the operating environment, and possibly the user’s whole job.
        If you’re a business analyst, project manager, or project sponsor, you
        have to anticipate the resistance and plan how you will overcome it,
        so the users will accept the new features or system.</p><p class="calibre3">An existing, established system is probably stable, fully
        integrated with surrounding systems, and well understood by users. A
        new system with all the same functionality might be none of these upon
        its initial release. Users might fear that the new system will disrupt
        their normal operations while they learn how to use it. Even worse, it
        might not support their current operations. Users might even be afraid
        of losing their jobs if the system automates tasks they perform
        manually today. It’s not uncommon to hear users say that they will
        accept the new system only if it does everything the old system
        does&mdash;even if they don’t personally use all of that functionality at
        present.</p><p class="calibre3">To mitigate the risk of user resistance, you first need to
        understand the business objectives and the user requirements. If
        either of these misses the mark, you will lose the users’ trust
        quickly. During elicitation, focus on the benefits the new system or
        each feature will provide to the users. Help them understand the value
        of the proposed change to the organization as a whole. Keep in
        mind&mdash;even with enhancements&mdash;that just because something is new doesn’t
        mean it will make the user’s job easier. A poorly designed user
        interface can even make the system harder to use because the old
        features are harder to find, lost amidst a clutter of new options, or
        more cumbersome to access.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1139" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1906" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2348" class="calibre"></a>Our organization recently upgraded our
        document-repository tool to a new version to give us access to
        additional features and a more stable operating environment. During
        beta testing, I discovered that simple, common tasks such as checking
        out and downloading a file are now harder. In the previous version,
        you could check out a file in two clicks, but now it takes three or
        four, depending on the navigation path you choose. If our executive
        stakeholders thought these user interface changes were a big risk to
        user acceptance, they could invest in developing custom functionality
        to mimic the old system. Showing prototypes to users can help them get
        used to the new system or new features and reveal likely adoption
        issues early in the project.</p><p class="calibre3">One caveat with system replacements is that the key performance
        indicators for certain groups might be negatively affected, even if
        the system replacement provides a benefit for the organization as a
        whole. Let users know as soon as possible about features they might be
        losing or quality attributes that might degrade, so they can start to
        prepare for it. System adoption can involve as much emotion as logic,
        so expectation management is critical to lay the foundation for a
        successful rollout.</p><p class="calibre3">When you are migrating from an existing system, transition
        requirements are also important. Transition requirements describe the
        capabilities that the whole solution&mdash;not just the software
        application&mdash;must have to enable moving from the existing system to the
        new system (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-44">[ref115]</a>). They can encompass data
        conversions, user training, organizational and business process
        changes, and the need to run both old and new systems in parallel for
        a period of time. Think about everything that will be required for
        stakeholders to comfortably and efficiently transition to the new way
        of working. Understanding transition requirements is part of assessing
        readiness and managing organizational change (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-44">[ref115]</a>).</p></div><div class="book" title="Can we iterate?"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3214">Can we iterate?</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Enhancement projects are incremental by definition. Project
        teams can often adopt agile methods readily, by prioritizing
        enhancements using a product backlog as described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 20. Agile projects" href="#calibre_link-25">Chapter&nbsp;20</a>. However, replacement projects do not
        always lend themselves to incremental delivery because you need a
        critical mass of functionality in the new application before users can
        begin using it to do their jobs. It’s not practical for them to use
        the new system to do a small portion of their job and then have to go
        back to the old system to perform other functions. However, big-bang
        migrations are also challenging and unrealistic. It’s difficult to
        replace in a single step an established system that has matured over
        many years and numerous releases.</p><p class="calibre3">One approach to implementing a replacement system incrementally
        is to identify functionality that can be isolated and begin by
        building just those pieces. We once helped a customer team to replace
        their current fulfillment system with a new custom-developed system.
        Inventory management represented about 10 percent of the total
        functionality of the entire fulfillment system. For the most part, the
        people who managed inventory were separate from the people who managed
        other parts of the fulfillment process. The initial strategy was to
        move just the inventory management functionality to a new system of
        its own. This was ideal functionality to isolate for the first release
        because it affected just a subset of users, who then would primarily
        work only in the new system. The one downside side to the approach is
        that a new software interface had to be developed so that the new
        inventory system could pass data to and from the existing fulfillment
        system.</p><p class="calibre3">We had no requirements documentation for the existing system.
        But retaining the original system and turning off its inventory
        management piece provided a clear boundary for the requirements
        effort. We primarily wrote use cases and functional requirements for
        the new inventory system, based on the most important functions of the
        existing system. We created an entity-relationship diagram and a data
        dictionary. We drew a context diagram for the entire existing
        fulfillment system to understand integration points that might be
        relevant when we split inventory out of it. Then we created a new
        context diagram to show how inventory management would exist as an
        external system that interacts with the truncated fulfillment
        system.</p><p class="calibre3">Not all enhancement or replacement projects will be this clean.
        Most of them will struggle to overcome the two biggest challenges: a
        lack of documentation for the existing system, and a potential battle
        to get users to adopt the new system or features. However, using the
        techniques described in this chapter can help you actively mitigate
        these risks.</p></div></section></div>

      shows, COTS packages typically need to be configured, integrated, and
      extended to work in the target environment. Some COTS products can be
      deployed out of the box with no additional work needed to make them
      usable. Most, though, require some customization. This could take the
      form of configuring the default product, creating integrations to other

      implementing packaged solutions. We do not distinguish between COTS and
      SaaS projects due to the similarity of the requirements activities
      involved. The decision to implement a packaged solution instead of
      custom developing a system is a matter of evaluating the
      cost-effectiveness of the two options and lies outside the scope of this
      book. If you’re building a packaged solution to sell, the other chapters
      in the book are more relevant because those projects involve custom
      software development.</p><p class="calibre3">This chapter describes several ways to approach requirements
      definition when you plan to acquire a commercial package to meet your
      needs. We also provide suggestions for how to develop requirements to
      implement the packaged solution in your operating environment.</p><div class="book" title="Requirements for selecting packaged solutions"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3217">Requirements for selecting packaged solutions</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">COTS packages offer the acquiring organization less flexibility
        to meet requirements than custom (sometimes called
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">bespoke</em></span>) development does. You need to know which
        requested capabilities aren’t negotiable and which you can adjust to
        fit within the package’s constraints. The only way to choose the right
        packaged solution is to understand the business activities the package
        must let the users perform. Selecting packaged solutions entails
        identifying your requirements for the software, at least at a high
        level. The level of detail and effort you should put into specifying
        requirements for COTS selection depends on the expected package costs,
        the evaluation timeline, and the number of candidate solutions.
        Compare buying personal finance management software to buying a
        multimillion-dollar financial application for a 5,000-person company.
        You might only name the most important use cases in the first
        scenario, but write full use cases and develop data and quality
        requirements for a more extensive evaluation in the second.</p><p class="calibre3">One team needed to select packaged software to run a law office.
        They identified 20 tasks that users needed to perform using the
        software, which led to 10 features to be assessed while evaluating 4
        candidate packages. The law partners knew they would have to create
        more detailed requirements to configure the software after they chose
        a package. However, a lightweight evaluation was appropriate for the
        package selection. In contrast, a team of 50 people worked together to
        develop detailed requirements for software to run a new semiconductor
        plant. There were only three candidate solutions to evaluate, but
        given the expected cost of the COTS software and its implementation,
        the company was willing to invest a lot in the selection process. They
        spent six months on the package selection alone.</p><div class="book" title="Developing user requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3218">Developing user requirements</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Any package you choose must let users accomplish their task
          objectives, although different packaged solutions will do so in
          different ways. The majority of your requirements efforts for COTS
          acquisition should be focused at the user requirements level. Use
          cases and user stories work well for this purpose. Process models
          can also be used and might already exist in the organization.
          There’s little point in specifying detailed functional requirements
          or designing a user interface, because the vendor (presumably)
          already did that.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-767" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-3219" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-3220" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-943" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2329" class="calibre"></a>It can also be helpful to list the features you need
          from the packaged solution. Identify the desired product features
          from an understanding of what users need to achieve with the
          solution and the business processes the package must enable. Suppose
          you have the following user story: “As a Research Manager, I need to
          review and approve new experiments before they are performed so that
          we don’t waste time and supplies on poorly designed experiments.”
          This user story helps identify the need for an approval workflow
          feature.</p><p class="calibre3">No packaged solution is likely to accommodate every use case
          you identify, so prioritize the user requirements or features. Trace
          them back to business requirements so you don’t waste time on
          unnecessary evaluation criteria. Distinguish capabilities that must
          be available on day one from those that can wait for future
          extensions and those that your users can live without, perhaps
          forever.</p></div><div class="book" title="Considering business rules"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3221">Considering business rules</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Your requirements exploration should identify pertinent
          business rules to which the COTS product must conform. Can you
          configure the package to comply with your corporate policies,
          industry standards, and relevant regulations? How easily can you
          modify the configured package when these rules change? Focus on the
          most important business rules, because it can be time consuming to
          evaluate the implementation of all of the pertinent rules.</p><p class="calibre3">Some packages incorporate widely applicable business rules,
          such as income tax withholding computations or printed tax forms. Do
          you trust that these are implemented correctly? Will the package
          vendor provide you with timely software updates when those rules and
          computations change? Will they charge you for the updates? Will the
          vendor supply a list of the business rules the package implements?
          If the product implements any intrinsic business rules that don’t
          apply to you, can you disable, modify, or work around them? Does the
          vendor accept enhancement requests? If so, how are they
          prioritized?</p></div><div class="book" title="Identifying data needs"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3222">Identifying data needs</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">You might need to define the data structures required to
          satisfy your user requirements and business rules, particularly if
          the new solution must be integrated into an ecosystem of existing
          applications. Look for major disconnects between your data model and
          the package vendor’s data model. Do not be distracted by data
          entities and attributes that are simply named differently in the
          COTS solution. Instead, recognize where entities or their attributes
          don’t exist in the packaged solution or have significantly different
          definitions from what you need, and then determine whether those
          entities can be handled in a different way for the solution to
          work.</p><p class="calibre3">Specify the reports that the COTS product must generate. Does
          it generate mandated reports in the correct formats? To what extent
          will the product let you customize its standard reports? Can you
          design new reports of your own to integrate with those that the
          vendor supplied?</p></div><div class="book" title="Defining quality requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3223">Defining quality requirements</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1163" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-3224" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1386" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1414" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1563" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1619" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1620" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1627" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1646" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1650" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1842" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1844" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1846" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1848" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1851" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1869" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2109" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2112" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-3225" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2287" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2370" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2501" class="calibre"></a>The quality attributes discussed in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 14. Beyond functionality" href="#calibre_link-40">Chapter&nbsp;14</a> are another vital aspect of user

          <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">not</em></span> met by any of the candidate packages and
          will require you to develop extensions. These can add significant
          costs to the COTS implementation and should be considered in the
          evaluation process.</p><p class="calibre3">Recently, my organization wanted to select a requirements
          management tool that&mdash;among other capabilities&mdash;allowed users to work
          offline and synchronize to the master version of the requirements
          when the users went back online (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-395">[ref014]</a>). We
          suspected that no tools on the market would offer a good solution
          for this. We included this capability in our evaluation to ensure
          that we uncovered any solutions that did offer it. If we didn’t find
          one, we would know that it was a capability we’d have to implement
          as an extension to the selected package. Alternatively, we’d need to
          change our process for editing requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">Another evaluation approach is to determine whether&mdash;and how
          well&mdash;the package will let the users perform their tasks by deriving
          tests from the high-priority use cases. Include tests that explore
          how the system handles significant exception conditions that might
          arise. Walk through those tests to see how the candidate packages
          handle them. A similar approach is to run the COTS product through a
          suite of scenarios that represent the expected usage patterns, which
          is called an <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">operational profile</em></span> (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-273">[ref175]</a>).</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3227" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">If you don’t have at least one person whose involvement
            spans all of the evaluations, there is no assurance that
            comparable interpretations of the features and scores were
            used.</p></div><p class="calibre3">The output of the evaluation process is typically an
          evaluation matrix with the selection requirements in the rows and
          various solutions’ scores for each of those requirements in the
          columns. <a class="xref" title="Figure 22-2. A sample of a packaged solution evaluation matrix for a requirements management tool." href="#calibre_link-396">Figure&nbsp;22-2</a>

            requirements management tool for our own consulting teams to use,
            I worked with the teams to identify the user classes and use cases
            for the tool. Although the primary users were business analysts,
            there were also a few use cases for managers, developers, and
            customers. I defined use cases by name and used my familiarity
            with the use cases to identify desired features. I created a
            traceability matrix to minimize the likelihood that any use cases
            or features would be missed.</p><p class="calibre3">We started with 200 features and 60 vendor choices, which
            were far too many for our evaluation timeline. We did a first-pass
            evaluation to eliminate most of the candidate tools. Our first
            pass considered only 30 features that we deemed the most important
            or most likely to distinguish tools from one another. This initial
            evaluation narrowed our search to 16 tool choices. Then we
            evaluated those 16 against the full set of 200 features. This
            detailed second-level evaluation resulted in a list of five
            closely ranked tools, all of which would clearly meet our
            needs.</p><p class="calibre3">In addition to an objective analysis, it’s a good idea to
            evaluate candidate packages by using a real project, not just the
            tutorial project that comes with the product. We ended up adding a
            third level of evaluation to actually try each of those five tools
            on real projects so we could see which one most closely reflected
            the evaluation scores in practice. The third phase of the
            evaluation allowed us to select our favorite tool from the
            high-scoring ones.</p></div></div></div><div class="book" title="Requirements for implementing packaged solutions"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3230">Requirements for implementing packaged solutions</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-869" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1623" class="calibre"></a>After you decide to implement a selected packaged

        provide useful capabilities that you hadn’t originally sought. You
        typically select the package based on what you know you need. However,
        during implementation, you might discover valuable features that you
        hadn’t even thought of. This can change the amount of work needed to
        install the package to exploit the additional features.</p><div class="book" title="Configuration requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3232">Configuration requirements</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Sometimes you can use a package just as it comes from the
          vendor. More often, you’ll need to adjust various configuration
          parameters in the package to better meet your needs. Configuration
          requirements are essential to most successful COTS implementations.
          One approach is to define configuration requirements for one process
          flow, use case, or user story at a time. Walk through user manuals
          for the purchased system to learn how to execute a specific task,
          looking for settings that need to be configured to suit your
          environment. Consider the full set of business rules when you are
          configuring the system, not just those you examined during the
          selection process. It might be helpful to create decision tables and
          decision trees to model these requirements. Many COTS solutions come
          with predefined mechanisms to specify roles and permissions. Use a
          roles and permissions matrix, such as the one shown in <a class="xref" title="Figure 9-2. Constraining business rules sometimes can be represented in a roles and permissions matrix." href="#calibre_link-196">Figure&nbsp;9-2</a> in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 9. Playing by the rules" href="#calibre_link-39">Chapter&nbsp;9</a> to define which roles to create
          and what permissions those roles should have.</p></div><div class="book" title="Integration requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3233">Integration requirements</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-963" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-972" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1196" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1309" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1384" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1617" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1621" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1624" class="calibre"></a>Unless the packaged solution is used in a standalone
          mode, you’ll need to integrate it into your application environment.
          This integration involves understanding the external interfaces the
          package will present to each of the other applications with which it
          must interact. Precisely specify the requirements for interchanging
          data and services between the package and other components in your
          environment. You will likely have to create some custom code to make
          all the parts fit together. This code could take the form of:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Adapters that modify interfaces or add missing
              functionality.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Firewalls that isolate the COTS software from other parts
              of the enterprise.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Wrappers that intercept inputs to and outputs from the
              package and modify the data as necessary to be used on the other
              side of the interface (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-399">[ref176]</a>).</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="book" title="Extension requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3234">Extension requirements</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">One common goal of COTS implementations is to minimize
          customizations to the solution. Otherwise, you should just custom
          build the application yourself. In most COTS projects, though, there
          will be gaps between what the organization needs and what the
          package delivers. For each such gap, decide whether to ignore it
          (remove the requirement and just live with the tool); change how you
          do something outside the solution (modify the business process); or
          build something to bridge the gap (extend the solution). If you are
          extending the COTS solution, you’ll need to fully specify the
          requirements for those new capabilities just as you would for any
          new product development. If you are implementing a COTS solution to
          replace an older system, look at the practices related to replacing
          a system that were discussed in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 21. Enhancement and replacement projects" href="#calibre_link-18">Chapter&nbsp;21</a>. While analyzing
          the requirements for any components to be added, assess whether they
          could negatively affect any existing elements or workflows in the
          package.</p></div><div class="book" title="Data requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3235">Data requirements</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Begin with the data requirements used in the selection
          process. Map data entities and attributes from your existing data
          dictionary to the COTS entities and attributes. There will likely be
          areas where the solution doesn’t handle some of your existing data
          entities or attributes. As with functional gaps, you’ll need to
          decide how to handle data gaps, typically by adding attributes or
          repurposing an existing data structure in the COTS solution.
          Otherwise, when you convert data from any existing systems into the
          COTS solution, you will likely lose any data that was not properly
          mapped. Use report tables to specify requirements for deploying
          existing or new reports, as described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 13. Specifying data requirements" href="#calibre_link-87">Chapter&nbsp;13</a>. Many COTS packages will
          provide some standard report templates to start with.</p></div><div class="book" title="Business process changes"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3236">Business process changes</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1616" class="calibre"></a>COTS packages are usually selected because
          implementing and maintaining them is expected to be less expensive
          than building custom software. Organizations need to be prepared to
          adapt their business processes to the package’s workflow
          capabilities and limitations. This is different from most
          development projects where the software is designed specifically to
          accommodate existing or planned processes. In fact, a COTS solution
          that can be fully configured to meet your existing processes is
          likely to be expensive and complex. The more buttons and knobs you
          can adjust, the harder it is to configure. You need to strike a
          balance between implementing all of the desired user functionality
          and only what the COTS product offers out of the box (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-400">[ref040]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3">Start with the user requirements identified during the
          selection process. Develop use cases or swimlane diagrams to
          understand how the tasks will change when users execute their tasks
          in the COTS solution. Users might resist the new packaged solution
          because it looks or behaves differently than their existing systems,
          so involve them early in this process. Users are more willing to
          accept the new solution if they contributed to shaping the necessary
          changes in their business processes.</p><p class="calibre3">My team implemented a packaged solution for an insurance
          company to let them meet new compliance requirements. We started by
          modeling the as-is business processes. Then we studied the package’s
          manuals to learn basic information about how to use the product.
          Based on the as-is models, we created to-be business processes to
          reflect how the users would complete their tasks using the COTS
          solution. We also created a data dictionary for their existing
          system and added a column to reflect the mapped field in the COTS
          solution. The users helped develop all of these work products, so
          they weren’t surprised by the new system when it was
          deployed.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Common challenges with packaged solutions"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3237">Common challenges with packaged solutions</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The following are common challenges that you might encounter

              candidates</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;There might be many solutions on the market that meet your
              needs at first glance. Select a short list of criteria to narrow
              the candidate list to a few top choices for a more refined
              evaluation.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Too many evaluation criteria" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Too many evaluation
              criteria</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;It might be hard to focus the evaluation criteria to only
              the most important ones without doing in-depth requirements
              specification. Use business objectives to help select the most
              important requirements as criteria. If you narrow the candidate
              package choices down to only a few, you can evaluate them
              against a long list of criteria.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Vendor misrepresents package capabilities" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Vendor misrepresents package
              capabilities</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;In the typical packaged software purchasing process, the
              vendor sales staff sells their solution to the customer
              organization’s decision makers, and then engages a technical
              implementation team to provide in-depth knowledge about the
              product. That in-depth knowledge might prove to conflict
              somewhat with the customer’s understanding of the product’s
              capabilities based on the sales pitch. It’s a good idea to ask
              to have a vendor technical specialist participate during the
              sales cycle. Determine whether you can have a healthy
              relationship with the vendor that enables both parties to be
              successful. The vendor is your business partner, so make sure
              they can play that role constructively.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Incorrect solution expectations" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Incorrect solution
              expectations</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;Sometimes a solution looks great during vendor demos, but
              it doesn’t work like you expect after installation. To avoid
              this, during the selection process, have the vendor walk through
              your actual use cases so you can see how well the solution
              matches your expectations.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Users reject the solution" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Users reject the
              solution</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;Just because an organization bought the software, there is
              no guarantee that the users will be receptive to it. As with all
              software development projects, engage users in the selection
              process or early in the implementation to make sure their needs
              are clearly understood and addressed to the extent possible.
              Expectation management is an important part of successful
              packaged solution implementation.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Buying, configuring, and extending a commercial software package
        often is a sensible business alternative to building a custom
        solution. Packages can provide a lot of flexibility, but at the same
        time they come with built-in limitations and constraints. You don’t
        want to have to pay for a lot of features that your organization
        doesn’t need. Nor do you want to build a fragile structure of
        extensions and integrations that might break with the next release of
        the package from the vendor. A careful package selection and
        implementation process will help you find the optimum balance of
        capability, usability, extensibility, and maintainability in a
        commercial packaged software solution.</p></div></section></div>

      many organizations outsource their development efforts to contract
      development companies. They might outsource the work to take advantage
      of development skills they do not have available in-house, to augment
      their internal staff resources, to save money, or to accelerate
      development. The outsourced development supplier could be located
      physically nearby, on the other side of the world, or anywhere in
      between. Outsourced teams in other countries are typically referred to
      as being <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">offshore</em></span>. Offshoring is sometimes called
      <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">nearshoring</em></span> if the supplier’s country is close by
      or shares a language and/or culture with the acquirer’s country.</p><p class="calibre3">All outsourced projects involve distributed teams, with people
      working in two or more locations. The role of a business analyst is even
      more important on these projects than on a co-located project. Often,
      the BA’s job is harder. If the team members are all in one location,
      developers can walk down the hall to ask the BA a question or to
      demonstrate newly developed functionality. This close collaboration
      can’t happen in the same way with outsourced development, although
      modern communication tools certainly help. Compared to in-house
      development, outsourced&mdash;and particularly offshore&mdash;projects face
      requirements-related challenges such as the following:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">It’s harder to get developer input on requirements and to pass
          along user feedback on delivered software to developers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">A formal contractual definition of requirements is necessary,
          which can lead to contention if differences of interpretation are
          discovered late in the project.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">There might be a bigger gap between what the customers
          ultimately need and the product they get based on the initial
          requirements, because there are fewer opportunities to adjust the

      anticipated cost savings based on hourly staff costs, many offshore
      projects actually experience a net <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">increase</em></span> in
      cost. Contributing factors include the additional effort required for
      more precise requirements, likely additional development iterations to
      close gaps because of unstated implied and assumed requirements, the
      additional overhead of the contractual arrangements, initial costs in
      developing effective norms of team behavior between the groups, and the
      costs of increased project communications and oversight
      throughout.</p><p class="calibre3">Software development work is the most common type of activity that
      is outsourced, but testing can also be outsourced. Outsourced testing
      presents the same challenges as outsourced development. Both types of
      activities rely on a solid foundation of clear requirements for
      success.</p><p class="calibre3">This chapter suggests techniques that are most important to enable
      successful requirements development and management on outsourced

        high-quality written requirements, because your direct interactions
        with the development team are likely to be minimal. As shown in <a class="xref" title="Figure 23-1. Requirements are the cornerstone of an outsourced project." href="#calibre_link-402">Figure&nbsp;23-1</a>, you’ll be
        sending the supplier a request for proposal (RFP), a requirements
        specification, and product acceptance criteria. Early on, both parties
        will engage in a review and will reach agreement, perhaps with
        negotiation and adjustments, before the supplier initiates
        development. The supplier will deliver the finished software product
        and supporting documentation.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-402" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3240" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000090.gif" alt="An illustration showing an Acquirer oval with an arrow               to a Supplier oval labeled “Request for proposal, requirements,               and acceptance criteria.” There is an arrow back to Acquirer               labeled “Software and documentation.” A third arrow between               Acquirer and Supplier is labeled “Review, negotiate, and               agree.”" class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;23-1.&nbsp;Requirements are the cornerstone of an outsourced
          project.</div></div><p class="calibre3">With outsourcing, you won’t have the opportunities for
        day-to-day clarifications, decision making, and changes that you enjoy
        when developers and customers work in close proximity. Particularly
        with offshore development, you should anticipate that the supplier
        will build exactly what you ask them to build. You will get no more
        and no less, sometimes with no questions asked. The supplier won’t
        implement the implicit and assumed requirements you thought were too
        obvious to write down. As a result, poorly defined and managed
        requirements are a common cause of outsourced project failure.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1542" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1800" class="calibre"></a>If you distribute an RFP, suppliers need to know exactly
        what you’re requesting before they can produce realistic responses and
        estimates (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-403">[ref190]</a>). Because of the information that
        has to go into the RFP, you might have to develop more detailed
        requirements earlier in the project than on in-house development
        projects (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-404">[ref172]</a>). At a minimum, specify a rich set
        of user requirements and nonfunctional requirements for the RFP. After
        the project is under way, you will likely need to specify all of the
        requirements with more precision than if an in-house team were
        building the same system, particularly if the outsourced team is
        offshore. If you are ever inclined to err on the side of
        overspecifying requirements, outsourced projects are the place to do
        so. It’s the requirements author’s responsibility to express the
        acquirer’s expectations clearly. If certain deliverables must be
        produced for the acquirer to maintain a process certification or for
        compliance reasons, be sure to include those particulars as part of
        the RFP as well.</p><p class="calibre3">As with in-house development, visual requirements models augment
        functional and nonfunctional requirements for outsourced teams.
        Creating multiple representations of requirements increases the
        bandwidth of communication, so you might find it beneficial to create
        more models than if an in-house team were developing the software.
        Using representations like visual models to supplement written
        specifications is even more valuable if you are working across
        cultures and native languages, because it gives developers something
        to check their interpretations against. However, be sure the
        developers can understand the models you send them. If they aren’t
        familiar with the models, that only raises the potential for
        confusion. One development manager was concerned that a written
        requirements specification plus mock-ups would not provide enough
        information for his offshore team to correctly implement a complex
        user interface (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-42">[ref013]</a>). The
        display-action-response model described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 19. Beyond requirements development" href="#calibre_link-94">Chapter&nbsp;19</a> was developed
        specifically to meet the needs of this outsourced project.</p><p class="calibre3">Prototypes can also help clarify expectations for the supplier
        team. Similarly, the supplier can create prototypes to demonstrate to
        the acquirer their interpretation of the requirements and how they
        plan to respond to them. This is a way to create more
        customer-development interaction points to make course adjustments
        early in the project rather than late. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 15. Risk reduction through prototyping" href="#calibre_link-10">Chapter&nbsp;15</a> has more information
        about creating and using prototypes.</p><p class="calibre3">Watch out for the ambiguous terms from <a class="xref" title="Table 11-1. Requirements for parsing documents" href="#calibre_link-224">Table&nbsp;11-1</a> in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 11. Writing excellent requirements" href="#calibre_link-59">Chapter&nbsp;11</a> that cause so much
        confusion. I once read an SRS intended for outsourcing that contained
        the word “support” in many places. The business analyst who wrote the
        SRS acknowledged that a contractor who was going to implement the
        software wouldn’t know just what “support” meant in each case. A
        glossary is valuable when dealing with people who don’t share the
        tacit knowledge held by those who are familiar with the acquiring
        company’s environment. The structured keyword notation called
        Planguage (see <a class="xref" title="Chapter 14. Beyond functionality" href="#calibre_link-40">Chapter&nbsp;14</a>) can be used to
        describe requirements very explicitly for outsourced development
        (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-405">[ref086]</a>).</p></div><div class="book" title="Acquirer-supplier interactions"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3241">Acquirer-supplier interactions</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-836" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-900" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-914" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1612" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1640" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1730" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1741" class="calibre"></a>In the absence of real-time, face-to-face communication,
        you need other mechanisms to stay on top of what the supplier is
        doing, so arrange formal touch points between the acquirer and the
        supplier. In some outsourced projects, the supplier helps to write the
        functional requirements (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-404">[ref172]</a>). This increases
        the initial costs associated with the outsourcing, but it also reduces
        the risk of misunderstandings.</p><p class="calibre3">Plan time for multiple review cycles of the requirements. Use
        collaboration tools to facilitate peer reviews with participants in
        multiple locations (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-54">[ref245]</a>). Be aware, though, that
        members of certain cultures find it difficult to offer even
        constructive criticism of another person’s work. Authors in such a
        culture whose work is being reviewed could take review comments
        personally (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-406">[ref232]</a>). The result is that the
        reviewers might sit politely during the peer review, saying nothing
        because they don’t want to offend the author. This is courteous and
        considerate, but it does not contribute to a shared goal of
        discovering requirements defects as early as possible to make
        development cheaper and faster. Discover whether this cultural
        characteristic applies to your outsource partners so you can determine
        realistic expectations and strategies for your peer reviews.</p><p class="calibre3">The project schedule for one failed offshore project included a
        one-week task named “Hold requirements workshops,” followed
        immediately by tasks to implement several subsystems (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-407">[ref246]</a>). The supplier forgot to include vital
        intermediate tasks to document, review, and revise the requirements
        specifications. The iterative and communication-intensive nature of
        requirements development dictates that you must allow sufficient time
        for these review cycles. The acquirer and the supplier on this project
        were in different countries, at opposite ends of the same continent.
        They experienced slow turnaround on the myriad questions that arose as
        the SRS cycled back and forth. Failure to resolve requirements issues
        in a timely way derailed the schedule and contributed to eventually
        sending the two parties into litigation.</p><p class="calibre3">Peer reviews and prototypes provide insight into how the
        supplier is interpreting the requirements. Incremental development is
        another risk-management technique that permits course corrections when
        a misunderstanding sends the supplier’s developers in the wrong
        direction. If the supplier raises questions, document them and
        integrate the answers into the requirements (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-405">[ref086]</a>). Monitor the resolution of the questions in an
        issue-tracking tool to which both supplier and acquirer teams have
        access, as described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 27. Requirements management practices" href="#calibre_link-89">Chapter&nbsp;27</a>.</p><p class="calibre3">Contract development companies that work on many types of
        projects might lack the specific domain or company knowledge that is
        critical to making the right decisions. Consider delivering some
        training to the contractor staff about the project and application
        domain prior to requirements review, to try to bridge this knowledge
        gap.</p><p class="calibre3">Outsourced projects often involve teams with disparate company
        cultures and attitudes. Some suppliers will be so eager to please that
        they agree to outcomes they cannot deliver. When an error is brought
        to their attention, they might strive to save face by not fully
        accepting responsibility for the problems. Additional cultural
        differences arise with offshore suppliers. Some developers might
        hesitate to ask for help or clarification. They might be reluctant to
        say “no” or “I don’t understand.” This can lead to misinterpretations,
        unresolved issues, and unachievable commitments. To avoid these
        issues, employ elicitation and facilitation techniques such as reading
        between the lines for what isn’t said and asking open-ended questions
        to gain accurate visibility into issues and status. Consider
        establishing ground rules with your team members, both local and
        remote, to expressly define how the team members should interact when
        they work together.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-652" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-3242" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-800" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1613" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1768" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2091" class="calibre"></a>Developers whose first language is different than the
        language in which the requirements are written are likely to interpret
        requirements literally, not picking up nuances or fully appreciating
        the implications. They might make user interface design choices that
        you wouldn’t expect. Things as diverse as date formats, systems of
        measurement (such as United States customary units, SI units, or
        imperial units), the symbolism of colors, and the order of people’s
        given and family names can vary between countries. When interacting
        with people who have a different native language from yours, make your
        intentions and desires as clear as possible in simple language. Avoid
        the use of colloquialisms, jargon, idioms, and references to pop
        culture that could be misconstrued.</p><p class="calibre3">One offshore team took a customer’s requirements very literally.
        It was as though the developers translated each requirement from
        English into their own language, coded it, moved on to the next
        requirement, and continued until they reached the end of the list. The
        product that was delivered to the customer technically met the
        requirements, but it fell far short of meeting expectations. The
        developers weren’t trying to be difficult. They just didn’t understand
        the language of the requirements very well. Consequently, they never
        fully grasped the essence of what they were building. The customer
        brought most of the development work back in-house and effectively had
        to pay twice to have the software developed correctly.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3243" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Don’t assume that suppliers will interpret ambiguous and
          incomplete requirements the same way that you do. The burden is on
          the acquirer to communicate all necessary information to the
          supplier, using frequent conversations to resolve requirements
          questions. But the burden is on the supplier to proactively ask
          clarifying questions instead of making assumptions that could be
          incorrect.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Change management"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3244">Change management</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">At the beginning of the project, establish a mutually acceptable
        change control process that all participants can use, no matter where
        they’re located. Using a common set of web-based tools for handling
        change requests and tracking open issues is essential. Change always
        has a price, so using change management practices to control scope
        creep is vital in a contract-development situation. Identify the
        decision makers for proposed changes and the communication mechanisms
        you’ll use to make sure the right people are kept informed. Most
        outsourced work has contractual agreements in place to describe
        exactly what the development team must deliver. The contract should
        specify who will pay for various kinds of changes, such as newly
        requested functionality or corrections made in the original
        requirements, and the process for incorporating the changes into the
        product. When there is misalignment between requirements and delivery,
        the arguments that ensue are consequently also contractual in nature.
        Unfortunately, often both parties lose (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-408">[ref165]</a>).</p></div><div class="book" title="Acceptance criteria"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3245">Acceptance criteria</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-537" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1611" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2286" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2499" class="calibre"></a>In keeping with Stephen Covey’s recommendation to “begin
        with the end in mind” (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-309">[ref051]</a>), define in advance
        how you’ll assess whether the contracted product is acceptable to you
        and your customers. How will you judge whether to make the final
        payment to the supplier? If the acceptance criteria are not fully
        satisfied, who is responsible for making corrections, and who pays for
        those? Include acceptance criteria in the RFP so the supplier knows up
        front what to expect. Validate the requirements before you give them
        to the outsourced team, to help ensure that the delivered product will
        be on target. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 17. Validating the requirements" href="#calibre_link-60">Chapter&nbsp;17</a> suggested
        some approaches to defining acceptance criteria, as well as methods
        for reviewing and testing requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">Properly handled, outsourcing the development work can be an
        effective strategy to build your software system. Building
        collaborative relationships with outsourced development suppliers is
        challenging because of distance, language and cultural differences,
        and potentially competing interests. Suppliers might not be motivated
        to correct any requirement errors or ambiguities discovered along the
        way if they will be paid more to fix the problems following delivery
        of a release candidate. An essential starting point on a journey to a
        successful outsourced development experience is a set of high-quality,
        complete, and explicitly clear requirements. If the requirements you
        provide to the supplier are incomplete or misunderstood, failure of
        the project is probably at least as much your fault as theirs.</p></div></section></div>

<div class="calibre1" id="calibre_link-409"><section title="Chapter 24. Business process automation projects" type="chapter" id="calibre_link-3246"><div class="titlepage" id="calibre_link-235"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title1">Chapter&nbsp;24.&nbsp;Business process automation projects</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-712" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-724" class="calibre"></a>Organizations often choose to fully or partially replace
      manual business processes with software to lower operational costs. In
      fact, most corporate IT projects involve some amount of business process
      automation, including the Chemical Tracking System and other projects we
      have mentioned in this book. Processes can be automated by building a
      new software system, extending an existing system, or buying a COTS
      package. If you’re working on a business process automation project,
      there are several requirements techniques to consider using to mesh the
      new systems and updated business processes.</p><p class="calibre3">Because business process automation is so prevalent in software
      projects, many of the techniques described elsewhere in this book are
      relevant. This chapter presents a structure to help you tackle these
      sorts of projects and points out the techniques from the rest of the
      book that are most applicable. It also presents some additional
      techniques that aren’t covered elsewhere in the book.</p><p class="calibre3">Here’s an illustration of how business process automation projects
      sometimes go. One customer of ours had a spreadsheet that used
      approximately 300 inputs from different sources to calculate a risk
      profile for loans. The business stakeholders wanted software that would
      gather the data inputs and run the risk profile calculation, because it
      took a long time for their risk managers to execute this frequently
      repeated process. We analyzed where their users spent the bulk of their
      time on this process and quickly determined that assembling the data
      that fed into the spreadsheet took the most time. The calculations the
      spreadsheet performed were nearly instantaneous. The development team
      already had access to most of the data sources to populate the
      spreadsheet, so a manageable first phase of the project was to
      automatically pull that data into the spreadsheet. The business users
      would continue to manually assemble the rest of the inputs for awhile.
      In the second phase, development would automate the rest of the data
      inputs. The team decided they would not build software to replicate the
      spreadsheet calculations because the calculations were fast enough
      already.</p><p class="calibre3">This case study illustrates a typical business process automation
      project. The business identified a time-consuming, repetitive activity
      that they thought could be accelerated with the help of suitable
      software. Some analysis revealed the bottlenecks and identified possible
      efficiencies. This led to requirements and project plans for a partial
      solution that would save the business considerable time, reduce costs,
      and reduce data input errors.</p><div class="book" title="Modeling business processes"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3247">Modeling business processes</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-665" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-717" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-718" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-719" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-720" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-721" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-723" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1080" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1509" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1510" class="calibre"></a>Eliciting requirements to automate business processes

        those tasks. The processes that describe how the business currently

          process model and notation (BPMN). This chapter is not a
          comprehensive resource on those topics. The following list provides
          some basic definitions of these concepts and their purposes, though
          you will find significant overlap in these definitions:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Business process analysis (BPA) involves understanding the
              processes as a basis for improving them. It is similar to
              process modeling, as described in the Business Analysis Body of
              Knowledge (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-44">[ref115]</a>).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Business process reengineering (BPR) consists of analyzing
              and redesigning business processes for greater efficiency and
              effectiveness. BPR could target specific process areas, or it
              could involve a complete overhaul of an organization’s processes
              from the ground up (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-410">[ref101]</a>).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Business process improvement (BPI) involves measuring and
              looking for opportunities for incremental process improvement
              (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-411">[ref104]</a>). Tools from Six Sigma and lean
              management practices are often used for BPI efforts (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-412">[ref212]</a>).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Business process management (BPM) encompasses
              understanding all of the enterprise’s business processes,
              analyzing them to make them more efficient and effective, and
              working with organizations to make changes to the processes
              (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-413">[ref103]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-414">[ref217]</a>). A BPM
              initiative might involve some combination of BPA, BPR, and
              BPI.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Business process model and notation (BPMN) is a graphical
              notation for modeling business processes (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-415">[ref180]</a>). BPMN can be applied in any of these
              approaches to business process modeling. It is a robust language
              of symbols that can be useful when the basic syntax of a
              swimlane diagram doesn’t suffice.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">A variety of methods and tools implement BPA, BPR, BPI, and
          BPM, which are appropriate to employ if your project is undergoing
          major business process redesign. All four techniques are established
          approaches for understanding the business challenges and
          opportunities. After an organization decides that a software
          component is part of the solution for improving their business
          processes, the requirements engineering techniques described in this
          book become valuable.</p></div><div class="book" title="Using current processes to derive requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3249">Using current processes to derive requirements</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-554" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-714" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-847" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1260" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1437" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1698" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2224" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2442" class="calibre"></a>The following steps will help you model a set of
          business processes and elicit requirements for an application that
          automates some or all of them. The sequence of these steps is not
          always the same, and you might not need all of them on every
          project. In some cases, the to-be process flows can come earlier in
          the sequence as a way of driving a gap analysis or to help ensure
          that the new system is more just than the old system dressed up in a
          new outfit. In general, though, consider following these
          steps:</p><div class="book"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1"><p class="calibre3">As always with software development, start by
              understanding the business objectives, so you can link each
              objective to one or more processes.</p></li><li class="listitem" value="2"><p class="calibre3">Use organization charts to find all of the affected
              organizations and potential user classes for a future software
              solution.</p></li><li class="listitem" value="3"><p class="calibre3">Identify all of the relevant business processes involving
              participation of those user classes.</p></li><li class="listitem" value="4"><p class="calibre3">Document the as-is business processes by using flow
              charts, activity diagrams, or swimlane diagrams. Any of the
              three models is a practical choice for representing users’
              tasks. Users can quickly read them and point out any missing or
              incorrect steps, roles, or decision logic (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-42">[ref013]</a>). You’ll need to judge how far down into the
              as-is modeling you need to drill to get the necessary
              information to perform the remaining steps in this list.</p></li><li class="listitem" value="5"><p class="calibre3">Analyze the as-is processes to determine the biggest
              opportunities for improvement from automation. If this is not
              obvious, you will need to gather some data about how long it
              takes to execute individual steps or full processes. You can
              model these measures by using the key performance indicator
              model (KPIM) described later in this chapter. This step helps
              identify opportunities and, if a software solution is deemed
              appropriate, set the scope of the software development part of
              the project. Make sure you are addressing true bottlenecks in
              the process, so that accelerating them will speed up the overall
              process.</p></li><li class="listitem" value="6"><p class="calibre3">For the processes that are in scope for automation, walk
              through each as-is process flow with the appropriate
              stakeholders to elicit software requirements to support each
              step in the flow. The techniques described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 7. Requirements elicitation" href="#calibre_link-31">Chapter&nbsp;7</a> will be valuable during
              this activity. If applicable, you might also look for industry
              standards for the process you are modeling, to help you set
              improvement goals.</p></li><li class="listitem" value="7"><p class="calibre3">Trace the requirements to the process flow steps so that
              it is obvious if you are missing requirements for any specific
              steps. If you have process steps without requirements traced to
              them, confirm that those steps are not being automated as part
              of the project.</p></li><li class="listitem" value="8"><p class="calibre3">Document to-be process flows to help the business prepare
              for the new system and to identify any gaps that the new system
              might leave in their process. You might also create use cases to
              provide more detail about how users will interact with the new
              system. This information helps developers ensure that they
              create a system to meet the business’s expectations and helps
              users understand what they are getting. The to-be process flows
              and use cases can be used to develop training materials for the
              new system and to identify any other transition requirements.
              This step helps stakeholders to understand not only what is
              coming, but what manual activities and automated systems need to
              be unplugged.</p></li></ol></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3250" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">When software isn’t the solution</div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-725" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1480" class="calibre"></a>Sometimes you don’t need to automate anything to
            improve business processes. One company had an internal website
            where it stored the names of people who worked on specific client
            projects: sales representative, implementation consultant, and so
            on. The sales representative data was nearly always accurate, but
            the implementation consultant data was wrong more than half the
            time. This resulted in people having to chase down who to contact.
            When you multiply the 2 or 3 minutes that each of the 200 people
            in the business unit spent on this activity at least once a week
            for a year’s time, the cost ended up being enormous. The problem:
            there was no process in place between the sales and implementation
            teams to update the implementation project data after the project
            started. The solution: figure out who in sales would serve as the
            contact for gathering and manually updating contact information
            for the implementation team for each client. New software wouldn’t
            have helped with this process shortcoming.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Designing future processes first"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3251">Designing future processes first</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">There is a chicken-and-egg problem with information systems
          and business processes. In some cases, people expect that building a
          new system will drive improvements or changes in the processes.
          However, the way the application is used in practice might not
          enable the desired business process changes. Process changes involve
          culture changes and user education that a software system cannot
          deliver. Some customers believe that the development team is
          responsible for a successful application rollout and for guiding the
          implementation of associated business processes. Users won’t embrace
          a new system just because a developer says to, though.</p><p class="calibre3">In many cases, it’s better to devise the new business
          processes first and then assess the needed changes in your
          information systems architecture. Properly supporting a new business
          process might involve changing multiple systems. Thinking about
          which users will use the system and how they will use it to do their
          jobs will help you define the correct user requirements, which in
          turn will maximize user adoption of the new system. Concurrent
          development of new processes and new applications helps ensure that
          the two merge nicely.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Modeling business performance metrics"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3252">Modeling business performance metrics</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">It’s important to understand which business performance metrics
        are most important to address with business process automation so that
        the development work can be prioritized. You might have success
        metrics to use as a starting point from the vision and scope document
        (see the <a class="xref" title="1.4 Success metrics" href="#calibre_link-416">1.4 Success metrics</a> section in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 5. Establishing the business requirements" href="#calibre_link-32">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>). If not, the
        business performance metrics developed here will help complete the
        vision and scope. For the spreadsheet example earlier in the chapter,
        you might care about how long it takes to populate the spreadsheet
        manually and how fast you need it to be in the automated
        solution.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-715" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1261" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1267" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1438" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1481" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1699" class="calibre"></a>KPIMs associate business processes with their important
        performance metrics. KPIMs are drawn as flowcharts, swimlane diagrams,
        or activity diagrams with key performance indicators (KPIs) overlaid
        on the related steps. <a class="xref" title="Figure 24-1. Example KPIM for a loan risk profile calculation process." href="#calibre_link-417">Figure&nbsp;24-1</a> shows an example
        KPIM (drawn as a flowchart) for the spreadsheet project to automate a
        risk profile calculation spreadsheet.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-417" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3253" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000091.jpeg" alt="A process flowchart showing two metrics. The first               metric is above the first four steps and indicates that the goal               is to reduce the time to process those steps from 120 minutes to               2 minutes. The second metric is on the calculation step in the               flow and states a goal that 100% of calculations have no errors               introduced." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;24-1.&nbsp;Example KPIM for a loan risk profile calculation
          process.</div></div><p class="calibre3">The most important processes to automate are those that have the
        most important metrics to maintain or improve. Determine a current
        baseline value for each metric, so that when you automate the process,
        you can tell if they are improving as desired. Keep in mind that you
        might degrade certain business performance metrics to improve others.
        <a class="xref" title="Chapter 14. Beyond functionality" href="#calibre_link-40">Chapter&nbsp;14</a> discusses making trade-offs
        between quality attributes. The same concept applies here, but in this
        case the trade-offs are to favor one performance metric over another,
        perhaps in different parts of the business. Tracing requirements to
        the process flow steps, which in turn are mapped to KPIs, allows you
        to prioritize the requirements to be implemented.</p><p class="calibre3">You might need to build functionality into the system to
        periodically measure the relevant KPIs to evaluate the effectiveness
        of the newly automated solution, raising a warning flag if a KPI falls
        out of tolerance. In the spreadsheet example, the system could measure
        how much time it takes to aggregate data inputs to determine if the
        system is achieving the two-minute goal. If not, further changes might
        be needed.</p><p class="calibre3">Business users often think it’s always best to automate a manual
        process if you can. However, there are costs associated with all
        development projects. Business analysis helps you determine which
        processes are worth automating and which are not. As an example,
        Seilevel (Joy’s company) uses a COTS solution for managing the sales
        pipeline and another for managing human resource allocations. We run a
        report from the sales pipeline tool and manually input the upcoming
        projects into the resource allocation tool to forecast resource needs.
        Our consulting manager has to do this at least once a week. It takes
        him approximately 30 minutes each week to run the sales pipeline
        report, decide which projects from sales should be transferred, when
        those projects will start, and how many resources each one needs. We
        evaluated whether we should enable the integration feature to
        automatically transfer the data from one tool to the other. Although
        integrating the tools is as simple as enabling a feature, it would
        require custom development to automate the decision process our
        consulting manager goes through. Specifying and automating that
        decision logic would require more effort than we can justify.</p></div><div class="book" title="Good practices for business process automation projects"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3254">Good practices for business process automation projects</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-722" class="calibre"></a>Many of the practices from the rest of this book are

      They study views of the data to make decisions about what to do, be it a
      decision to take some specific action or a decision to do nothing at
      all. In some cases, software systems automate the decision-making
      processes by interpreting data and taking actions based on predefined
      algorithms and rules. The main purpose of <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">business
      analytics</em></span> (also called <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">business
      intelligence</em></span> or <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">reporting</em></span>) projects is
      to develop systems that turn large and often highly complex data sets
      into meaningful information from which decisions can be made. Many other
      classes of projects might have business analytics components; the
      concepts presented in this chapter apply to those projects as
      well.</p><p class="calibre3">The decisions that people make using business analytics systems
      can be strategic, operational, or tactical. An executive might look at
      his sales team’s global performance dashboard to decide who to promote
      (tactical), which products need different marketing strategies
      (operational), or which products to target by markets (strategic).
      Generally speaking, all software systems that include an analytics
      component should enable users to make decisions that improve
      organizational performance in some dimension.</p><p class="calibre3">There are many software applications commercially available to
      implement business analytics solutions. The business analyst who wants
      to use one of those applications might need to perform requirements
      activities for tool selection and implementation, using the process

        projects, complex reports and the ability to manipulate their contents
        constitute the core functionality. Often, the output of analysis is
        embedded in applications that automate decision making. Business
        analytics projects have multiple layers, all of which might need to
        have software requirements defined for them. These projects must deal
        with understanding what data is required, the operations performed on
        the data, and the formatting and distribution of the data for use
        (<a class="xref" title="Figure 25-1. The components of a simple business analytics framework." href="#calibre_link-421">Figure&nbsp;25-1</a>). There
        is no rigid sequence to these activities. A user might work with the
        data, then realize she needs different analysis performed on the data,
        and perhaps even different data sources.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-421" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3257" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000092.jpeg" alt="An illustration showing three boxes for data, analysis,               and information usage.

        primarily focused on what the <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-422">[ref121]</a> calls
        “descriptive analytics.” This includes looking at reports that tell
        stakeholders what is happening&mdash;or has happened&mdash;in their organization.
        Recent trends indicate a shift toward more organizations using
        “predictive analytics.” Users organize, manipulate, and analyze
        information to predict what might happen in the future, as opposed to
        interpreting the past. <a class="xref" title="Figure 25-2. A spectrum of types of analytics ([ref182]; [ref052])." href="#calibre_link-423">Figure&nbsp;25-2</a> shows where
        various applications of analytics fit on a spectrum ranging from more

        analysts will find themselves tasked with eliciting and specifying
        requirements for these projects, but perhaps not knowing where to
        start. The strategic possibilities, the new analytics technologies,
        and the rapidly growing quantity of collected data can be
        intimidating. The end products of requirements development for a
        business analytics project will be similar to those for any other
        project: a set of business, user, functional, and nonfunctional
        requirements. However, many of the requirements practices described in
        this book are not sufficient to elicit and specify requirements for
        these types of projects. Process flows, use cases, and user stories
        can reveal that someone needs to generate analytics results, and
        performance requirements describe how quickly they need results, but
        none of these uncovers the complex knowledge required to implement the
        system.</p><p class="calibre3">If an organization is new to analytics, it should pilot a few
        small projects to demonstrate the value of analytics and to learn from
        the experience (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-426">[ref099]</a>). Analytics projects are
        good candidates for incremental development if the team can identify
        the most important or most time-critical decisions that can be
        implemented in the next development iteration.</p><p class="calibre3">Another reason to consider incremental development is that
        business stakeholders sometimes have a hard time articulating and
        prioritizing the business problems they want to solve with an
        analytics project, particularly if it’s their first. Some stakeholders
        might have had little practice thinking strategically. Others might
        find it hard to envision the possibilities that analytics technologies
        offer beyond their familiar spreadsheets. Users might get so excited
        about new analytics capabilities that they overwhelm the development
        team with features that sound potentially valuable. Elicitation might
        need to begin with some education about what new capabilities a
        business analytics solution can provide over traditional data
        reporting tools (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-427">[ref119]</a>). Developing the analytics
        solution in small chunks will give the users an opportunity to explore
        the initial capabilities and clarify their ideas of what they really
        need.</p></div><div class="book" title="Requirements development for business analytics projects"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3259">Requirements development for business analytics
        projects</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">As with other software projects, business analytics projects
        first need to have business objectives defined to establish and
        prioritize the scope of work. If stakeholders request an analytics
        project, they’ve already decided on that as a solution and might not
        have thought through their objectives carefully. Exploring the
        underlying business objectives might reveal that business analytics
        are not the right solution at all. To help stakeholders state their
        actual business objectives, you might ask the following
        questions:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Why do you think an analytics solution will help you achieve
            the desired business outcomes?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">What do you want to accomplish by implementing analytics

        outlines an approach to elicit and specify requirements for analytics
        projects. User requirements should be defined to describe how the
        analytics information will be used and what decisions will be made
        from it. Understanding the expected usage modes allows you to specify
        how the generated information should be distributed to end users and
        what information they need to see. This knowledge in turn allows you
        to define requirements for the data itself and for the analyses to be
        performed. The rest of the chapter describes each of these steps in
        more detail.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-429" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3260" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000094.jpeg" alt="The process to define requirements for business analytics projects." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;25-3.&nbsp;The process to define requirements for business analytics

          considering how they contribute to satisfying the business
          objectives. The same consideration is valid on analytics projects,
          except that there aren’t discrete “features” to prioritize. Instead,
          you use the business objectives to prioritize the business decisions
          that the solution will enable, based on how much they contribute to
          achieving the objectives. For example, deciding which products to
          sell will have a greater impact on increasing revenue than making
          decisions about a sales team’s vacation time. Therefore, you would
          likely implement the analytics and reports to determine which
          products to sell first.</p><p class="calibre3">Decisions should be stated as unambiguously as requirements.
          An example of a good decision statement is, “The vice president of
          marketing needs to decide each quarter how much marketing budget to
          allocate to each region based on current and targeted sales by
          region.” As with requirements elicitation on other software
          projects, it’s important to understand the underlying stakeholder
          need instead of just focusing on a presented solution. If
          stakeholders request certain data or reports, ask questions such as
          “Why do you need that information?” and “How will the recipient use
          that report?” Then work backward to identify their decisions and
          objectives.</p><p class="calibre3">Decision management techniques are available to help
          stakeholders identify the decisions they could or should make (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-430">[ref227]</a>). A decision model that maps information (data)
          and knowledge (policies or regulations that constrain decisions) to
          related decisions can help organize the decisions to permit
          prioritization (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-428">[ref228]</a>).</p></div><div class="book" title="Defining how information will be used"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3262">Defining how information will be used</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-694" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-939" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1912" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2441" class="calibre"></a>The results of complex analytics must be delivered in
          a usable form to the stakeholders or systems that need to act on the
          information. The BA must also determine how smart the system is&mdash;that
          is, how much of the decision making is done by a human user and how
          much is automated in the system. This distinction will drive the
          type of elicitation questions the business analyst will ask.</p><p class="calibre3">In one organization, the executive sales team wanted to see a
          dashboard report every morning showing multiple views of the data.
          This report had to include the previous day’s sales by product line,
          quarterly sales by product line, total sales compared to
          competitors’ sales, and sales volume by price band. They wanted 10
          different filters (such as timeframe, increment, and region) that
          they could modify to see immediate changes in the reports. For
          example, if a user noticed a sales issue within a specific price
          band, she could change the filter to see a more precise view of the
          price band data by region. She could further drill down to look at
          another layer of detail that shows price band by region and by
          product line. This sort of flexibility is a common capability needed
          by business analytics systems.</p><div class="book" title="Information usage by people"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-3263">Information usage by people</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">After you understand the decisions that users will need to
            make with the outputs of the analytics system, you can determine
            the best ways to deliver the information to them. The business
            analyst will need to consider the following three aspects of
            information delivery:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p title="Delivery mechanism" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Delivery
                  mechanism</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;How is information physically made available to the
                  end user? What tools can the user employ to view it: email
                  applications, portals, mobile devices, others?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Format" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Format</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;In what format is the information delivered: reports,
                  dashboards, raw data, other?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Flexibility" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Flexibility</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;To what extent must the user be able to manipulate the
                  information following delivery?</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">The spectrum of information delivery ranges from having each
            user create his personal view of the data (a local copy of a
            spreadsheet), to distributing a central aggregation of the data to
            users (emailed spreadsheets with standard dashboard views), to
            exposing data for users to manipulate on their own (a portal that
            permits ad hoc querying of a set of data).</p><p class="calibre3">As with requirements for other types of software systems,
            information usage on an analytics project is most commonly
            captured in the form of user requirements and report
            specifications. Techniques described elsewhere in the book&mdash;such as
            process flows, use cases, and user stories&mdash;apply for identifying
            how users plan to use the information in their daily tasks. Rather
            than focusing on specifying the data fields in the reports,
            though, use the decisions to be made to determine how users should
            receive the analytics output, how it should look, and how they
            need to be able to manipulate it.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-690" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-945" class="calibre"></a>Report tables, as described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 13. Specifying data requirements" href="#calibre_link-87">Chapter&nbsp;13</a> are useful on most
            analytics projects. You might have to extend these models for more
            complex options by using layers in the report specifications
            (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-42">[ref013]</a>). Users of analytics data often like to
            see information presented in a dashboard view, with multiple
            charts and reports laid out in a single display. The <a class="xref" title="Dashboard reporting" href="#calibre_link-431">Dashboard reporting</a> section in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 13. Specifying data requirements" href="#calibre_link-87">Chapter&nbsp;13</a> will help you specify
            such dashboard requirements. Some reports give the user the
            ability to manipulate views of the reports in predefined ways,
            such as with filters (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-432">[ref077]</a>). The
            display-action-response model described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 19. Beyond requirements development" href="#calibre_link-94">Chapter&nbsp;19</a> is valuable for
            specifying more comprehensive requirements for manipulating data
            in reports, when a simple report table structure won’t suffice.
            These models capture complex interactive user interface elements
            on reports, such as filters or changes in display from
            drill-downs.</p><p class="calibre3">Beyond user requirements and reporting requirements,
            understanding information usage might also reveal new processes
            and security requirements that need to be defined. For example,
            the president of a small company might receive a weekly
            profit-and-loss report. If it looks correct, he will share it with
            his executive team&mdash;but only with his executive team, which implies
            the need for access controls. Security requirements, as described
            in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 14. Beyond functionality" href="#calibre_link-40">Chapter&nbsp;14</a> might also be needed
            for data attributes, report views, or portal access. Perhaps
            regional sales vice presidents can see sales data for their region
            only, but a global vice president can view it for the entire
            organization. These sorts of quality attribute requirements apply
            to business analytics projects just as they do to any other
            software project.</p></div><div class="book" title="Information usage in systems"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-3264">Information usage in systems</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">It’s important to note that the information from analytics
            projects might be used directly within software systems instead of
            being delivered to human users. The analytics might be embedded in
            the application as part of its daily operations. For example, some
            retail organizations use a customer’s purchasing history to
            determine what products to apply personalized discounts to, in
            hopes of getting that customer to buy more from them. One retail
            chain determined that I was pregnant within a month of my knowing
            it, and they started sending email advertisements to me for baby
            products (this is obviously Joy’s story!). Other examples include
            a system that prints coupons for a grocery shopper based on his
            current or prior purchases, customized ads displayed to website
            visitors, and call center applications that determine what offers
            to make to a particular customer who just called.</p><p class="calibre3">In these situations, the information delivery mechanism and
            format might be specified through external interface requirements.
            However, it is still important to understand how the information
            will be used so that the correct data is transformed as needed and
            delivered to the interfacing system in a usable form.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Specifying data needs"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3265">Specifying data needs</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Data forms the core of all business analytics solutions. Many
          organizations employ data experts to develop and maintain their data
          solutions for these projects. BAs can define requirements for data
          sources, storage, management, and extraction mechanisms, although
          they might engage data specialists early in the requirements efforts
          to help. BAs can help explore what types of data need to be
          collected and analyzed, the total quantity of data the organization
          will be dealing with, and how much data they will accumulate over
          time. However, the data experts will be more familiar with what data
          is available, where it’s located, what challenges it might present,
          and how it can best be exploited.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-658" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-948" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1061" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1147" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1479" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1506" class="calibre"></a>Because analytics projects often aim to discover new
          strategies for companies, these projects might involve identifying
          new data sources to analyze. It’s important to fully understand the
          data requirements so technical teams can design the often complex
          infrastructures needed to support analytics. For example, architects
          might have to completely redesign an existing data storage solution
          to meet your project’s needs.</p><div class="book" title="Big data"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-3266">Big data</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The term <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">big data</em></span> typically describes a
            collection of data that is characterized as large volume (much
            data exists), high velocity (data flows rapidly into an
            organization), and/or highly complex (the data is diverse) (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-432">[ref077]</a>). Managing big data entails discovering,
            collecting, storing, and processing large quantities of data
            quickly and effectively. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-433">[ref065]</a> provides a
            summary of what big data entails from the perspective of
            management and governance.</p><p class="calibre3">To really conceptualize big data, think about your personal
            data-based interactions from a single day: social media, email
            messages, videos, digital images, and electronic transactions.
            Consider that a commercial aircraft generates 10
            <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">terabytes</em></span> of data during a 30-minute flight
            (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-434">[ref210]</a>). The nature of businesses today is
            that the data available to them is undergoing explosive growth.
            Applications that help users glean valuable knowledge from the
            mountains of data are therefore increasingly important.</p><p class="calibre3">The data models described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 13. Specifying data requirements" href="#calibre_link-87">Chapter&nbsp;13</a> are best suited to
            representing relational data stores. If the data objects relate to
            one another in some logical way, the BA can model those objects by
            using entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs). If the data attributes
            are known and consistent, data dictionaries also can be useful.
            Unfortunately, big data is often only semi-structured or even
            unstructured.</p><p class="calibre3">Unstructured data, exemplified by voice mails and text
            messages, doesn’t lend itself to representation in traditional
            rows and columns. The challenge with unstructured data is that you
            have no idea where or how to begin looking for the information you
            seek (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-435">[ref053]</a>). For instance, software operated
            by a security-related government agency might scan Internet
            traffic for instances of a word such as “bomb,” but they need to
            see it in context to know the meaning of the word of interest.
            “Bomb” could indicate a terrorist threat, refer to an article on
            aerial combat in World War II, or describe a bad play’s opening
            night.</p><p class="calibre3">The good news is that most data does possess some structure
            in the form of accompanying metadata, or data about the data
            (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-432">[ref077]</a>). Semi-structured data sources include
            email messages, image files, and video files. Because
            semi-structured data has associated metadata that provides some
            information about the data’s structure and contents, you might be
            able to create entity-relationship diagrams and data dictionaries
            to represent what you do know about the data.</p></div><div class="book" title="Data-based (not “database”) requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-3267">Data-based (not “database”) requirements</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-692" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-969" class="calibre"></a>Many of the data requirements that need to be
            specified for analytics projects are similar to those for other
            information systems projects. Although the nature of those
            requirements might not be the same, the questions you ask to
            elicit them are often similar. Keep in mind that most big data is
            generated by automated systems and usually represents a new data
            source for an organization, which means that it will take more
            work to determine the data requirements (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-432">[ref077]</a>). You can derive many data requirements from
            the decision-management criteria that you elicit from appropriate
            stakeholders. For example, decisions that need to be made hourly
            will likely have different underlying data needs from those that
            are made just once per calendar quarter. They might differ in
            terms of how frequently the source data is refreshed, when the
            data is extracted from the source, and how long the data must be
            retained.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-420">[ref029]</a> provides a checklist of common
            expectations that stakeholders might have about business analytics
            and types of questions that can elicit those expectations.
            Following are some examples of questions a BA can ask to elicit
            data-related requirements:</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Data sources</strong></span></p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">What data objects and/or attributes do you need? From

          in this chapter; it transforms the data and leads to answers to the
          questions posed (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-432">[ref077]</a>). A user defines a
          problem, receives data that he hopes will contain an answer,
          analyzes the data to find the answer, and decides on a solution to
          the problem. Or maybe the system analyzes the data to find the
          answer and then takes an action accordingly.</p><p class="calibre3">All of this is great, if you know what you are looking for.
          However, one challenging aspect of many business analytics projects
          is that the decision maker might not know just what he’s looking for
          in the data. He might want to have certain data objects and
          attributes exposed in tools that allow him to explore, running
          different queries to ask what-if questions about the data. He
          literally doesn’t know what he doesn’t know, but he’s hoping that by
          studying the data he’ll glean something useful to act on. This is
          why it’s important to start by understanding what decisions the
          stakeholders are trying to make. Even if he doesn’t know exactly
          what he’s looking for yet, a stakeholder should be able to define
          the type of problem he’s trying to solve. Defining the necessary
          data analysis involves big-picture thinking (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-435">[ref053]</a>). A BA with good creative-thinking skills can
          work with stakeholders to determine what new ideas might be explored
          with the analysis results.</p><p class="calibre3">As <a class="xref" title="Figure 25-2. A spectrum of types of analytics ([ref182]; [ref052])." href="#calibre_link-423">Figure&nbsp;25-2</a>
          showed, analytics results lead to decision-making capabilities
          ranging from descriptive to predictive. To elicit the data analysis
          requirements, you might ask questions such as the following (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-435">[ref053]</a>):</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">What time frame are you trying to analyze: past, present,
              or future?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">If past, what kinds of insights about the past are you
              looking for?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">If present, what do you need to understand about the
              current situation so that you can take immediate actions?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">If future, what kinds of predictions or decisions do you
              want to make?</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">These questions will help you define functional requirements
          that specify the analyses the system must perform. Because analytics
          is a completely new capability for many organizations, you might do
          some research to discover how other organizations are using similar
          data to improve decision making. A business analyst has the
          opportunity&mdash;perhaps even the responsibility&mdash;to help the stakeholders
          learn how analytics could be used in ways they hadn’t previously
          envisioned.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-693" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-3269" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-3270" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-846" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1911" class="calibre"></a>Some analysis requires sophisticated algorithms to
          process, filter, and organize the data (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-424">[ref182]</a>).
          Suppose a retail store wants to play targeted video ads when a
          customer walks in the store. A camera might scan her, perhaps by
          using facial recognition software, and the system will combine what
          it can learn about the customer (gender, age, attire, where she is
          looking) with logic built into the system to decide which ad to
          play. This type of decision logic can often be represented by using
          decision tables or decision trees, as described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 12. A picture is worth 1024 words" href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter&nbsp;12</a>.</p><p class="calibre3">It is important to understand the implications of automated
          decision making and be explicitly clear when defining the desired
          decision-logic system behaviors. A cautionary example is provided by
          systems that can scan social media and make stock trade movements
          accordingly. In 2013, a false piece of social media news reported
          that the president of the United States was injured in an explosion.
          The algorithms built into certain automated systems triggered them
          to start selling stocks, which led other systems to also sell stocks
          when they detected the market’s decline, all within moments of the
          news release. Fortunately, the hoax was discovered quickly, and
          human decisions reversed the sudden sharp stock market drop caused
          by the automated trading systems. Perhaps the systems behaved
          exactly as intended, but maybe there was decision logic missing that
          could have limited the impact.</p><p class="calibre3">One of the most valuable aspects of business analytics systems
          is that they can enable future-state strategic analysis, such as
          exploring what-if scenarios. Consider questions such as, “If we
          offered our product on a new platform, what would we expect our
          future sales numbers to be?” or “If we offered our customers
          products targeted to their gender, how much more would they buy?”
          The system can run models and algorithms to enable these types of
          data extrapolations or predictions. Those models and algorithms need
          to be specified in the software requirements. If they are highly
          complex, a BA might enlist the help of data experts, statisticians,
          and mathematical modelers to help define them.</p><p class="calibre3">The analyses might require statistical or other computations
          to transform the data prior to it being presented to the user or
          delivered to a system for action. Either business rules in the
          organization or other industry standards could define these
          calculations. For instance, if analysis includes reporting gross
          profit margins by region, you need to specify exactly how that
          margin is calculated in your organization. The calculation formula
          requirement pattern described by <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-211">[ref253]</a> can be
          used to specify literally any calculation that is needed to
          transform the data. A specified formula should include a description
          of the value to be calculated, the formula itself, the variables
          used, and where their values come from. Also, specify any response
          time requirements for those calculations.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="The evolutionary nature of analytics"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3271">The evolutionary nature of analytics</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 25-1. The components of a simple business analytics framework." href="#calibre_link-421">Figure&nbsp;25-1</a>
        illustrated the back-and-forth interactions between data, its
        analysis, and its usage (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-432">[ref077]</a>). Occasionally, the
        user receives a report and makes a decision, and then she’s done. More
        commonly with business analytics applications, the user starts with a
        question and requests a report containing information relevant to the
        decision she must make. Someone extracts the requested data from
        available repositories, applies the relevant analytics processing, and
        delivers the report to the user. But after she sees the information,
        the user will think of new questions that require further analysis,
        which leads to requests for new reports and yet more analyses.</p><p class="calibre3">The key to defining requirements for analytics projects,
        therefore, is to start somewhere. Because the requirements might
        change over time, begin with what the stakeholders already know they
        want to learn from the available information, and plan for their
        questions to evolve. Also, understand how much the users expect their
        needs to evolve. For example, if they believe their needs from the
        business analytics solution will change significantly over time, they
        might require a solution that is easily adaptable and requires minimal
        additional development work.</p><p class="calibre3">An analytics solution should take into consideration the forms
        and conditions the data is in at the times it is extracted from a
        source, analyzed, and viewed by a user. For example, do users want
        certain raw data to be delivered to them so they can generate reports
        manually to examine? Or do they want a software application to
        organize that data for them and deliver it in a predefined, structured
        format? Do the users have a set of questions to which they want the
        answers every week for the next year? Or do they want to be able to
        ask new questions every day, rapidly developing new forms of data
        analysis and presentation to keep pace with rapidly changing business
        needs? The answers to these types of questions will tell your
        development team whether to make sets of data available for users to
        manipulate themselves or whether an analytics team will have to
        generate and format new information for those users to view (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-432">[ref077]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3">Your job as a BA on a business analytics project is to work with
        the project’s stakeholders to understand their decision processes. Use
        those decisions to elicit the requirements that will access the
        necessary data, specify the analyses to be performed, and define the
        data presentation. You should understand what results stakeholders
        expect from an analytics solution, the decisions they hope the data
        will help them make, and how they want to dynamically modify the
        analyses or their presentation. Look for opportunities to help users
        be more successful by envisioning solutions that they might not have
        imagined were even possible.</p></div></section></div>

      book so far have dealt with business information systems. The world is
      also full of products that use software to control hardware devices,
      broadly called embedded systems. Among countless examples are cell
      phones, television remote controls, kiosks of all sorts, Internet
      routers, and robot cars. We’ve often used the term
      <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">system</em></span> in this book as a colloquial synonym for
      product, application, or solution, to refer to whatever
      software-containing thing you’re building. In this chapter, though,
      <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">system</em></span> refers to a product that contains multiple,
      integrated software and hardware subsystems. The software that controls
      a real-time system can be embedded in the device in the form of a
      dedicated computer, or it can reside in a host computer separate from
      the hardware it controls. Embedded and other real-time systems have
      sensors, controllers, motors, power supplies, integrated circuits, and
      other mechanical, electrical, and electronic components that operate
      under software control.</p><p class="calibre3">Real-time systems can be classified as hard or soft.
      <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Hard real-time systems</em></span> have rigid time constraints.
      The operations that the system performs must execute within specified
      deadlines or bad things happen. Life-critical and safety-critical
      control systems, such as air traffic control systems, are hard real-time
      systems. An operation that doesn’t complete on time could result in a
      collision because of an undetected obstacle. <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Soft real-time
      systems</em></span> also are subject to time constraints, but the
      consequences of missing the timing deadline during some operations are
      less severe. An ATM is a soft real-time system. If communication between
      the ATM and the bank doesn’t complete in the allocated time interval, no
      one will die if the ATM has to try again or even if the operation
      terminates.</p><p class="calibre3">More than on most software development projects, it’s important to
      have a good understanding of requirements before getting too far into
      development on embedded systems projects. Because software is more
      malleable than hardware, excessive requirements churn that dictates
      hardware changes is more expensive than comparable volatility on
      software-only projects. It’s also essential to know about constraints
      that both hardware and software engineers must respect: physical object
      sizes; electrical components, connections, and voltages; standard
      communication protocols; the sequence in which certain operations must
      take place; and the like. Hardware components that have already been
      selected for the design impose constraints on those yet to be
      chosen.</p><p class="calibre3">The requirements elicitation techniques described elsewhere in
      this book are certainly applicable on real-time projects. The same
      modeling techniques can be used, with some refinements. This chapter
      addresses some of the special requirements considerations of embedded
      and other real-time systems.</p><div class="book" title="System requirements, architecture, and allocation"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3273">System requirements, architecture, and allocation</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-602" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-620" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1002" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1136" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1286" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1897" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2138" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2235" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2240" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2241" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2242" class="calibre"></a>When specifying a complex system, many teams first
        create a system requirements specification, abbreviated
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">SyRS</em></span> (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-37">[ref124]</a>). The SyRS
        describes the capabilities of the system as a whole, including
        capabilities that could be provided by hardware components, software
        components, and/or humans. It also describes all of the inputs and
        outputs associated with the system. In addition to functionality, the
        SyRS should specify the critical performance, safety, and other
        quality requirements for the product. All this information feeds into
        the preliminary design analysis that will guide the team when it is
        choosing architectural components and allocating capabilities to them.
        The SyRS could be a separate deliverable from the software
        requirements specification, or the SRS could be embedded within the
        SyRS, particularly if most of the system complexity lies within the
        software.</p><p class="calibre3">Requirements analysis of a complex system is tightly intertwined
        with the system’s architecture. Requirements thinking and design
        thinking become more commingled in real-time systems than in other
        types of software projects. The architecture represents the top level
        of design, often depicted by using simple box-and-arrow diagrams,
        although numerous other architecture modeling notations exist. A
        system’s architecture consists of three elements:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Components of the system, where a component could be a
            software object or module, a physical device, or a person</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Externally visible properties of the components</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Connections (interfaces) between the system
            components</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">The architecture is developed in a top-down, iterative fashion
        (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-437">[ref178]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-226">[ref110]</a>). The person who
        takes the lead role in this type of analysis typically is a system
        analyst, requirements engineer, system engineer, or system architect
        with a strong technical background. The analyst partitions the system
        into appropriate software and hardware subsystems and components that
        will accommodate all of the inputs and produce all of the outputs.
        Certain system requirements might turn directly into software
        requirements if software is deemed to be the correct medium for
        providing a certain capability. In other cases, the analyst will
        decompose individual system requirements into numerous derived
        software, hardware, and/or manual requirements to be performed by
        humans (<a class="xref" title="Figure 26-1. System requirements are decomposed into software, hardware, and manual requirements, then allocated to appropriate components." href="#calibre_link-438">Figure&nbsp;26-1</a>).
        Deriving software requirements from system requirements can expand the
        volume of requirements several-fold, partly because that derivation
        generates interface requirements between the components. The analyst
        allocates the individual requirements to the most appropriate
        components, iteratively refining the architectural partitioning and

        or replace state-transition diagrams, often revealing errors in the
        diagrams. The context diagram (described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 5. Establishing the business requirements" href="#calibre_link-32">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>) is also useful to
        show the environment in which the system operates and the boundaries
        between the system and the external entities with which it interfaces.
        Architecture diagrams show the partitioning of the system into
        subsystems with interfaces between them. This section shows some
        sample models (somewhat simplified, as usual) from an embedded system

          treadmill’s functionality that flesh out the high-level view shown
          in the STD in <a class="xref" title="Figure 26-3. Partial state-transition diagram for an exercise treadmill." href="#calibre_link-442">Figure&nbsp;26-3</a>. It’s also a
          great aid for conceiving tests. Even a complete event-response table
          still leaves plenty of design thinking to be done, such as how many
          degrees per minute the incline motor will change the belt’s incline,
          and how quickly the treadmill belt will change from stopped to the
          set speed. Safety considerations will influence these decisions,
          too. It would be dangerous for the Exerciser if the belt started,
          accelerated, or stopped too abruptly.</p><p class="calibre3">Embedded systems must manage a combination of event-based
          functions (as shown in <a class="xref" title="Table 26-1. Partial event-response table for an exercise treadmill" href="#calibre_link-443">Table&nbsp;26-1</a>) and periodic
          control functions. Periodic functions are executed repeatedly while
          the system is in a particular state, rather than just once upon
          state entry. An example is monitoring the Exerciser’s pulse rate
          once every second and adjusting the belt speed in response to
          maintain a preset pulse rate, if such an exercise program was being
          used.</p><p class="calibre3">Drawing models like this is an excellent way to find missing
          requirements. I once reviewed a requirements specification for an
          embedded system that included a long table describing the various
          machine states, the functionality associated with each state, and
          possible navigation destinations from each state. I drew a
          state-transition diagram to represent that information at a higher
          level of abstraction. In the process of drawing the STD, I
          discovered two missing requirements. There was no requirement that
          allowed the machine to be turned off, and there was no provision for
          the possibility of entering an error state while the machine was
          running. As you’ve seen before, this example illustrates the value
          of creating multiple representations of requirements knowledge and
          verifying them against each other.</p></div><div class="book" title="Architecture diagram"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3281">Architecture diagram</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-618" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1388" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2366" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2419" class="calibre"></a>Another type of model that’s useful for these types of
          systems is an architecture diagram, which is generally part of the
          high-level design. <a class="xref" title="Figure 26-4. Partial architecture diagram for an exercise treadmill." href="#calibre_link-444">Figure&nbsp;26-4</a> shows a
          portion of a simple architecture diagram for the treadmill. It
          identifies the major subsystems that will provide all of the
          treadmill’s functions, as well as the data and control interfaces
          between them, at a high level of abstraction. Richer architecture
          description languages are available, and the Unified Modeling
          Language (UML) also works well for modeling architectures (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-364">[ref208]</a>). The subsystems shown in <a class="xref" title="Figure 26-4. Partial architecture diagram for an exercise treadmill." href="#calibre_link-444">Figure&nbsp;26-4</a> can be further
          elaborated into specific hardware components (motors and sensors)
          and software components as architectural analysis proceeds. A
          preliminary architecture analysis can reveal and refine functional,
          interface, and quality requirements that might not have been evident

          analysis is clearly taking a step into design. It’s a necessary
          step. Iterating on the architectural partitioning and the allocation
          of system capabilities to subsystems and components is how an
          architect devises the most appropriate and effective solution.
          Further requirements elicitation is needed, though. Functional
          requirements such as the following will guide the developers in both
          choosing appropriate hardware components and designing user
          interface controls:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4"><span class="calibre"><strong class="bolditalic">Incline.Angle.Range</strong></span> The Exerciser shall
            be able to increase and decrease the incline angle of the
            treadmill from 0 degrees through 10 degrees, inclusive, in 0.5-
            degree increments.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4"><span class="calibre"><strong class="bolditalic">Incline.Angle.Limits</strong></span> The treadmill shall

            reached the minimum or maximum limit of its incline
            range.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">In addition to the functionality represented by the
          architecture, the treadmill designers must know about the business
          rules that provide necessary algorithms. An example is calculating
          the number of calories the Exerciser has burned from the combination
          of his weight and the workout program, which is a series of segments
          of specified duration, incline angle, and belt speed. It might seem
          peculiar to speak of “business rules” in conjunction with an
          embedded system. However, virtually all of the requirements
          practices discussed elsewhere in this book apply to embedded and
          other real-time systems, just as they do to business information
          systems.</p></div><div class="book" title="Prototyping"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3283">Prototyping</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Prototyping and simulation are other powerful techniques for

          Because of the costs and time needed to build hardware (and perhaps
          to rebuild it if you discover requirement or design errors), you can
          use prototypes to test operational concepts and to explore both

        the SRS should address four classes of external interface
        requirements: user, software, hardware, and communications interfaces.
        In addition, the partitioning of complex systems into multiple
        subsystems creates numerous internal interfaces between components.
        Because embedded systems can be incorporated into other embedded
        systems as part of a larger product (such as a cell phone integrated
        into a motor vehicle’s communication system), the interface issues
        become even more complex. Requirements analysis should concentrate on
        the external interface issues, leaving the internal interface

        if signals are not received from sensors as scheduled, if the software
        cannot send control signals to the hardware when anticipated, or if
        the physical devices do not perform their actions on time. Timing
        requirements involve multiple dimensions:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p title="Execution time" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Execution time</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;The execution time for a specific task is the elapsed time

              occurs and when the system begins to respond to it. Excessive
              latency poses a problem in, for example, music recording and
              production software, in which multiple prerecorded and live

              especially “fast,” events often have to be performed at precise
              intervals, as when sampling an incoming signal. Digitizing an
              audio waveform often is performed at 44,100 cycles per second.
              The sampling frequency must be predictable to avoid constructing
              a distorted digital representation of the analog

        and the acceptable timing tolerances. Understand the distinction
        between soft and hard real-time demands for your system so you don’t
        specify overly stringent timing requirements. Those can lead to
        over-engineering the product at excessive cost and effort. If the
        timing tolerances are broader, you might be able to get away with
        using less expensive hardware. As <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-448">[ref141]</a> points
        out, “Real-time performance is seldom about being as fast as
        absolutely possible. Rather, it is about being just as fast as you
        need to be, and minimizing overall cost.”</p><p class="calibre3">Specifying the timing requirements for the system involves
        understanding the deadlines for time-critical functions. It entails
        scheduling both sequential and concurrent functions to achieve the
        necessary performance within the constraints of processor capacity,
        input/output rates, and network communication rates. One team used a
        project-scheduling tool to model the timing requirements for an
        embedded product, working at the millisecond time scale rather than in
        the more traditional days and weeks. This creative and unconventional
        use of a modeling tool worked very well. In some cases, the timing and
        scheduling algorithms to be used might be imposed through requirements
        in the form of design constraints, but more frequently these will be
        design choices. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-449">[ref136]</a> offer a valuable overview of
        scheduling issues for real-time systems.</p></div><div class="book" title="Quality attributes for embedded systems"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3287">Quality attributes for embedded systems</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1135" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1156" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1578" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1647" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1651" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1836" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1852" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1856" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1896" class="calibre"></a>Quality attribute requirements are especially critical
        for embedded and real-time systems. They can be vastly more complex
        and intertwined than those for other software applications. Business
        software is generally used in an office where there is not much
        variance in the environment. In contrast, the operating environment
        for embedded systems could involve temperature extremes, vibration,
        shock, and other factors that dictate specific quality considerations.
        Quality categories that are likely to be particularly important
        include performance, efficiency, reliability, robustness, safety,
        security, and usability. This section discusses some of the particular
        aspects of these quality attributes that you need to explore carefully
        during elicitation of requirements for such systems.</p><p class="calibre3">In addition to the software quality attributes that were
        discussed in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 14. Beyond functionality" href="#calibre_link-40">Chapter&nbsp;14</a> embedded systems
        are subject to quality attributes and constraints that apply only to
        physical systems. These include size, shape, weight, materials,
        flammability, connectors, durability, cost, noise levels, and
        strength. All of these can dramatically increase the cost and effort
        needed to validate the requirements adequately. There could be
        business and political reasons to avoid using materials whose supply
        might be threatened by conflict or boycott, causing prices to
        skyrocket. Other materials are best avoided because of their
        environmental impacts. Avoiding the use of optimal materials could
        lead to trade-offs in performance, weight, cost, or other
        attributes.</p><p class="calibre3">It can be difficult and expensive to build in desired quality
        characteristics after the hardware design is complete, so address
        these requirements early during elicitation. Because quality
        characteristics often have a profound impact on a complex product’s
        architecture, it’s essential to perform the attribute prioritization
        and trade-off analysis before getting into design. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-448">[ref141]</a> presents a good discussion of nonfunctional
        requirements that are especially important for embedded systems
        development. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 14. Beyond functionality" href="#calibre_link-40">Chapter&nbsp;14</a> presented many
        examples of these and other quality attribute requirements.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Performance</strong></span> The essence of a
        real-time system is that its performance must satisfy the timing needs
        and constraints of the operating environment. Therefore, all
        processing deadlines for specific operations must be included in the
        requirements. However, performance goes beyond operational response
        times. It includes startup and reset times, power consumption, battery
        life, battery recharge time (as with electric automobiles), and heat
        dissipation. Energy management alone has multiple dimensions. How
        should the system behave if the voltage drops momentarily, or under a
        particularly high current load during startup, or if external power is
        lost and the device must switch to battery backup power? And, unlike
        software, many of these components can degrade over time. What are the
        requirements for how long a battery maintains a given profile of power
        over time before it needs to be replaced?</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1071" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1159" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1224" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1835" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1858" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1862" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1903" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2057" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Efficiency</strong></span> Efficiency
        is the internal quality counterpart to the externally observable
        attribute of performance. Efficiency aspects of embedded systems focus
        on the consumption (and hence the remaining availability at any
        moment) of resources including processor capacity, memory, disk space,
        communication channels, electrical power, and network bandwidth. When
        you are dealing with these matters, requirements, architecture, and
        design become tightly coupled. For instance, if the total power demand
        of the device could exceed the power available, can the device be
        designed to cut power to components that don’t need it all the time,
        thereby making more power available to other components or
        services?</p><p class="calibre3">The requirements should specify the maximum anticipated
        consumption of various system resources so designers can provide
        sufficient slack resources for future growth and unexpected operating
        conditions. This is one of those situations for which concurrent
        hardware and software design is vital. If the software is consuming
        too much of the available resources, the developers must resort to
        clever tricks to work around those limitations. Choosing more capable
        hardware up front offers a much less costly solution than fine-tuning
        the software components (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-448">[ref141]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Reliability</strong></span> Embedded and
        other real-time systems often have stringent reliability and
        availability requirements. Life-critical systems such as medical
        devices and airplane avionics offer little room for failure. An
        artificial cardiac pacemaker that’s implanted into a patient’s body
        must be expected to work reliably for years. If the product fails or
        the battery goes dead prematurely, the patient can die too. When you
        are specifying reliability requirements, realistically assess the
        likelihood and impact of failure so you don’t over-engineer a product
        whose true reliability requirements aren’t as demanding as you might
        think. Increasing reliability and availability comes at a price.
        Sometimes you need to pay that price; sometimes you do not.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3288" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">An open-door policy</div><p class="calibre3">A door on a light-rail train car in a major American city
          recently failed to close when the train left the station. Sensors
          apparently failed to notify the train’s driver of the malfunction.
          The train whizzed down the tracks at 55 miles an hour with an open
          door, a scary experience and an obvious safety hazard. The
          developers of the train software might have had a reliability or
          safety requirement stating that such an event could happen no more
          often than once every 100 million operating hours. You can’t run a
          railway system for a few hundred million hours before you release it
          to test whether this requirement was satisfied. Instead, you need to
          design systems in such a way that the probability of experiencing a
          safety-critical failure is sufficiently low to meet the requirement.
          But things can still fail. In complex systems like this, it is
          usually the combinations of failures you didn’t think of&mdash;corrosion
          on two switches, in this case&mdash;that cause such rare problems.</p></div><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Robustness</strong></span> Robustness has to
        do with how well the system responds to unexpected operating
        conditions. There are several aspects to robustness. One is
        survivability, which is often considered to apply to devices in use by
        the military but has everyday applications as well. A good example of
        embedded systems designed for high survivability are the aircraft
        “black boxes,” electronic recording devices that are designed to
        survive the horrific trauma of an airplane crash. Actually bright
        orange and technically called the flight data recorder and the cockpit
        voice recorder, these devices are built to withstand an impact of
        3,400 times the force of gravity, fires, immersion in water, and other
        hazards. Not only must the physical container retain its integrity
        under such extreme conditions, but the data recording devices inside
        must still be intact and readable.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1219" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1220" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1221" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1222" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1464" class="calibre"></a>Other aspects of robustness have to do with how the
        system deals with faults, or exceptions, that occur during execution
        and can lead to system failures. Both hardware and software faults can
        lead to failures. I once attempted to withdraw $140 from an ATM. The
        ATM gave me a receipt for $140, all right, but it only gave me $80 in
        cash. I waited 15 minutes while a bank employee rooted around in the
        back of the ATM; then she handed me my $60. Apparently there was a
        mechanical failure: several bills were stuck together and jammed the
        exit slot. Besides the fact that I wasted some time, I was concerned
        because the ATM thought the transaction had gone just fine&mdash;it never
        detected the problem.</p><p class="calibre3">There are four aspects to how systems handle faults (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-448">[ref141]</a>):</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p title="Fault prevention" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Fault
              prevention</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;Ideally, the system will prevent many potential fault
              conditions before they can cause a failure. That’s the idea
              behind having software systems test preconditions before
              initiating the execution of a use case.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Fault detection" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Fault
              detection</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;The next-best course of action is to detect a fault as
              soon as it occurs. This is why requirements elicitation must
              explore exception conditions, so developers can anticipate
              possible errors and devise ways to look for them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Fault recovery" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Fault recovery</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;If the system detects an anticipated fault, it should have
              mechanisms defined for responding to it. Requirements
              development should not only identify potential faults but also
              specify how they should be handled. Sometimes the system can
              retry an operation, as with an intermittent communication
              interruption or a timeout that might work fine the next time.
              Systems are sometimes designed with failover mechanisms. If a
              fault causes the system to fail, a backup system takes over the
              operation. In other cases, the system must terminate the
              operation, perhaps shutting down or restarting in some way that
              minimizes the negative impact on the user. As an example, if
              your car’s antilock brake system (ABS) detects a faulty sensor,
              it might shut down the ABS, illuminate a warning light on the
              dashboard, and log that information in the car’s computer for
              future diagnosis and repair. Which leads us to…</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Fault logging" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Fault logging</strong></span></strong></span>.&nbsp;The system should retain a history of faults that it
              detects and what happened as a consequence. This information is
              useful for diagnosing what’s wrong and can help a maintenance
              person detect patterns that lead to problems. For instance, a
              fault history might indicate a defective hardware component that
              should be replaced. Modern automobiles contain an on-board
              diagnostics system. A technician can plug a cable into this
              system and retrieve a history of events in the form of
              standardized codes that report what malfunctions
              occurred.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">The designers of my treadmill recognized that under certain
        conditions the treadmill can be jammed in a position in which the
        incline angle cannot be lowered to zero. The user manual describes a
        (rather tricky) manual operation I can perform to reset the treadmill
        so it again has the full range of incline angles available. It would
        have been even better had the manufacturer designed the treadmill so
        that it was impossible for this jam to take place, if feasible.
        Sometimes, though, providing a workaround for a low-probability and
        low-impact failure is cheaper than designing the system to completely
        prevent the failure.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1225" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1351" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1352" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1353" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1443" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1456" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1865" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1870" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2065" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2110" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2113" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Safety</strong></span> Any system

        analysis further.) A <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">fault tree analysis</em></span> is a
        graphical, root-cause analysis technique for thinking about safety
        threats and what factors could lead to them (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-453">[ref068]</a>). This allows you to focus on how to avoid
        specific combinations of risk factors materializing when your product
        is in use. Safety requirements should address the risks and state what
        the system must do&mdash;or must not do&mdash;to avoid them.</p><p class="calibre3">Hardware devices often include some kind of emergency stop
        button or dead man’s switch that will quickly turn the device off. The
        exercise treadmill had a safety requirement something like the
        following:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4"><span class="calibre"><strong class="bolditalic">Stop.Emergency</strong></span>
          The treadmill shall have an emergency stop mechanism that brings the
          belt to a halt within 1 second when activated.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">This requirement led to the design of a flat plastic key that
        must be inserted in the front of the treadmill before the treadmill
        can be powered up. Removing the key cuts the treadmill power, stopping
        the belt motion quickly. A lanyard attached to the key can be clipped
        to the Exerciser’s clothing to pull out the key if the Exerciser slips
        or falls off the treadmill. It works!</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Security</strong></span> The security of
        embedded systems is under much discussion these days because of
        concerns about cyberattacks that could take over, disrupt, or disable
        power plants, railroad control systems, electrical distribution grids,
        and other critical infrastructure. Theft of intellectual property from
        the memory of embedded systems is also a risk. An attacker could
        potentially reverse engineer code to learn how the system works,
        either to copy it or to attack it. Protecting embedded systems
        involves some of the same security measures that host-based
        information systems need. These include the following (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-448">[ref141]</a>):</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Secrecy, primarily through encryption</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Authentication, to ensure that only authorized users can

        other types of specific attacks. These include attempts by users to
        take over control of the system; interception of electronic
        communications, particularly wireless communications; and the
        insertion of malicious software updates, sometimes through social
        engineering of gullible users (many of us fall for that trick from
        time to time). The full scope of security considerations for embedded
        systems is large, and it is a very serious concern (ref007). <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-448">[ref141]</a> and <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-454">[ref140]</a> offer many
        suggestions for how to make your embedded products more secure.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Usability</strong></span> Many embedded
        systems include some kind of human-computer interface. The general
        principles of software usability apply, but other aspects of usability
        might be important when a person is using a physical device in the
        field as opposed to a keyboard in the office. Recently, I switched
        from using a mouse designed for right-handed users to a symmetrical
        one. I keep inadvertently hitting the right mouse button with the ring
        finger on my right hand. This wastes my time and can lead to undesired
        system responses.</p><p class="calibre3">Display screens on products to be used outdoors must accommodate
        different lighting situations. I once had an account at a bank whose
        drive-up ATM was located such that the LCD screen was completely
        unreadable when sunlight hit it at certain angles. As another example,
        I cannot read the display on my digital wristwatch when I’m wearing
        polarized sunglasses unless I rotate my wrist to just the right angle,
        because LCD displays are themselves polarized.</p><p class="calibre3">Some usability constraints are imposed by legislation such as
        the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires certain systems to
        provide accessibility aids for people who have physical limitations.
        Embedded systems must accommodate users having different degrees
        of:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Audio acuity and frequency response (consider when designing

        of challenges that software-only applications do not. The basic
        principles and practices of requirements elicitation, analysis,
        specification, and validation apply to both classes of products.
        Embedded systems require taking a systems engineering approach so that
        developers do not optimize either software or hardware components at
        the expense of the other and to avoid ugly integration problems.
        Architecture and design choices are more tightly linked with
        requirements analysis than in software-only systems, partly because it
        is so much more expensive to change hardware after it has been
        designed or manufactured. Embedded systems present a different
        emphasis of constraints and quality attributes than do software-only
        systems, and often they are more interwoven with operating system
        considerations as well. Careful specification of system requirements,
        software requirements, hardware requirements, and interface
        requirements will go a long way toward making your embedded and other
        real-time development projects successful.</p></div></section></div>

      frustrating it is when people waste time working from obsolete or
      inconsistent requirements specifications. Having great requirements gets
      you only partway to a solution; they also have to be well managed and
      effectively communicated among the project participants. Version control
      of individual requirements and sets of requirements is one of the core
      activities of requirements management.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Chapter 1. The essential software requirement" href="#calibre_link-21">Chapter&nbsp;1</a> divided the
      domain of software requirements engineering into requirements
      development and requirements management. (Some people refer to the
      entire domain as “requirements management,” but we favor a narrower
      definition of that term.) This chapter addresses some principles and
      practices of requirements management. The other chapters in <a class="xref" title="Part IV. Requirements management" href="#calibre_link-12">Part&nbsp;IV</a> describe certain
      requirements management practices in more detail, including change
      control (<a class="xref" title="Chapter 28. Change happens" href="#calibre_link-72">Chapter&nbsp;28</a>), change impact analysis
      (also <a class="xref" title="Chapter 28. Change happens" href="#calibre_link-72">Chapter&nbsp;28</a>), and requirements tracing

      of commercial tools that can help a project team develop and manage its
      requirements (<a class="xref" title="Chapter 30. Tools for requirements engineering" href="#calibre_link-90">Chapter&nbsp;30</a>).
      Note that a project might be managing certain sets of agreed-upon
      requirements while concurrently performing requirements development
      activities on other portions of the product’s requirements.</p><div class="book" title="Requirements management process"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3292">Requirements management process</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-647" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1956" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2341" class="calibre"></a>Requirements management includes all activities that

        teams are expected to perform to manage their requirements.
        Documenting these activities and training practitioners in their

        consistently and effectively. Consider addressing the following

        management process description. Alternatively, you might prefer to
        write separate version control, change control, impact analysis, and
        status tracking procedures. These procedures should apply across your
        organization because they represent common functions that every
        project team ought to perform. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 31. Improving your requirements processes" href="#calibre_link-15">Chapter&nbsp;31</a> describes several
        useful process assets for requirements management.</p><p class="calibre3">Your process descriptions should identify the team role that
        owns each of the requirements management activities. The project’s
        business analyst typically has the lead responsibility for
        requirements management. The BA will set up the requirements storage
        mechanisms, define requirement attributes, coordinate requirement
        status and trace data updates, and monitor change activity as needed.
        The process description should also indicate who has authority to
        modify the requirements management process, how exceptions should be
        handled, and the escalation path for impediments encountered.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3294" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">If no one on the project has responsibility for performing
          requirements management activities, don’t expect them to get done.
          Similarly, if “everyone” has the responsibility, each person might
          expect that someone else is covering the necessary activities, so
          they can easily be overlooked.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="The requirements baseline"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3295">The requirements baseline</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Requirements development involves activities to elicit, analyze,
        specify, and validate a software project’s requirements. Requirements
        development deliverables include business requirements, user
        requirements, functional and nonfunctional requirements, a data
        dictionary, and various analysis models. After they are reviewed and
        approved, any defined subset of these items constitutes a requirements
        baseline. As was described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 2. Requirements from the customer’s perspective" href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>, a requirements
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">baseline</em></span> is a set of requirements that
        stakeholders have agreed to, often defining the contents of a specific
        planned release or development iteration. The project might have
        additional agreements regarding deliverables, constraints, schedules,
        budgets, transition requirements, and contracts; those lie beyond the
        scope of this book.</p><p class="calibre3">At the time a set of requirements is baselined&mdash;typically
        following review and approval&mdash;the requirements are placed under
        configuration (or change) management. Subsequent changes can be made
        only through the project’s defined change control procedure. Prior to
        baselining, the requirements are still evolving, so there’s no point
        in imposing unnecessary process overhead on those modifications. A
        baseline could consist of some or all the requirements in a particular
        SRS (whether for an entire product or a single release), or a
        designated set of requirements stored in an RM tool, or an agreed-on
        set of user stories for a single iteration on an agile project.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-640" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1977" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2520" class="calibre"></a>If the scope of a release changes, update the
        requirements baseline accordingly. Distinguish the requirements in a
        particular baseline from others that were proposed but not accepted,
        are allocated to a different baseline, or remain unallocated in the
        product backlog. If the requirements are specified in the form of a
        document such as an SRS, clearly identify it as a baseline version to
        distinguish it from prior drafts. Storing requirements in an RM tool
        facilitates the identification of those that belong to a specific
        baseline and the management of changes to that baseline.</p><p class="calibre3">A development team that accepts proposed requirement changes or
        additions might not be able to fulfill its existing schedule and
        quality commitments. The project manager must negotiate changes to
        those commitments with affected managers, customers, and other
        stakeholders. The project can accommodate new or changed requirements
        in various ways:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">By deferring lower-priority requirements to later iterations
            or cutting them completely</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">By obtaining additional staff or outsourcing some of the
            work</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">By extending the delivery schedule or adding iterations to
            an agile project</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">By sacrificing quality to ship by the original date</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">No single approach is universally correct, because projects
        differ in their flexibility of features, staff, budget, schedule, and
        quality (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-66">[ref240]</a>). The choice should be based on the
        project’s business objectives and the priorities the key stakeholders
        established during project initiation. No matter how you respond to
        changing requirements, accept the reality of adjusting expectations
        and commitments when necessary. This is better than imagining that
        somehow all the new features will be incorporated by the original
        delivery date without budget overruns, team member burnout, or quality
        compromises.</p></div><div class="book" title="Requirements version control"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3296">Requirements version control</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Version control&mdash;uniquely identifying different versions of an
        item&mdash;applies at the level of both individual requirements and
        requirements sets, most commonly represented in the form of documents.
        Begin version control as soon as you draft a requirement or a document
        so you can retain a history of changes made.</p><p class="calibre3">Every version of the requirements must be uniquely identified.
        Every team member must be able to access the current version of the
        requirements. Changes must be clearly documented and communicated to
        everyone affected. To minimize confusion and miscommunication, permit
        only designated individuals to update the requirements, and make sure
        that the version identifier changes whenever an update is made. Each
        circulated version of a requirements document or each requirement in a
        tool should include a revision history that identifies the changes
        made, the date of each change, the individual who made the change, and
        the reason for each change.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3297" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">It’s not a bug; it’s a feature!</div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-649" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2338" class="calibre"></a>A contract development team received a flood of bug
          reports from the testers of the latest release they had just
          delivered to a customer. The contract team was perplexed&mdash;the system
          had passed all their own tests. After considerable investigation, it
          turned out that the customer was testing the new software against an
          obsolete version of the SRS. What the testers were reporting as bugs
          truly were features. Normally, this is just a little joke that
          software people like to make. The testers spent considerable time
          rewriting the tests against the correct version of the SRS and
          retesting the application, all because of a version control problem.
          Another colleague who once experienced the same kind of testing
          confusion because of an uncommunicated change said, “We probably
          wasted four to six hours of effort that our department had to absorb
          and couldn’t spend on actual billable hours. I think software
          professionals would be shocked if they multiplied out these wasted
          hours times their bill rate to see what the loss in revenue
          is.”</p><p class="calibre3">Similar confusion can arise when multiple BAs are working on a
          project. One BA begins to edit version 1.2 of the requirements
          specification. A few days later, another BA starts to work on some
          requirements and also labels his version 1.2, not knowing about the
          conflict. Pretty soon changes are lost, requirements are no longer
          up to date, work is overwritten, and confusion ensues.</p></div><p class="calibre3">The most robust approach to version control is to store the
        requirements in a requirements management tool, as described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 30. Tools for requirements engineering" href="#calibre_link-90">Chapter&nbsp;30</a>. RM tools track the
        history of changes made to every requirement, which is valuable when
        you need to revert to an earlier version. Such a tool allows for
        comments describing the rationale behind a decision to add, modify, or
        delete a requirement. These comments are helpful if the requirement
        becomes a topic for discussion again in the future.</p><p class="calibre3">If you’re storing requirements in documents, you can track
        changes by using the word processor’s revision marks feature. This
        feature visually highlights changes made in the text with notations
        such as strikethrough highlighting for deletions and underscores for
        additions. When you baseline a document, first archive a marked-up
        version, then accept all the revisions, and then store the now clean
        version as the new baseline, ready for the next round of changes.
        Store requirements documents in a version control tool, such as the
        one your organization uses for controlling source code through
        check-out and check-in procedures. This will let you revert to earlier
        versions if necessary and to know who changed each document, when, and
        why. (Incidentally, this describes exactly how we wrote this book. We
        wrote the chapters in Microsoft Word, using revision marks as we
        iterated on the chapters. We had to refer back to previous versions on
        several occasions.)</p><p class="calibre3">I know of one project that stored several hundred use case
        documents written in Microsoft Word in a version control tool. The
        tool let the team members access all previous versions of every use
        case, and it logged the history of changes made to each one. The
        project’s BA and her backup person had read-write access to the
        documents stored in the tool; the other team members had read-only
        access. This approach worked well for this team.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-633" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1690" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1887" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1922" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1968" class="calibre"></a>The simplest version control mechanism is to manually
        label each revision of a document according to a standard convention.
        Schemes that try to differentiate document versions based on dates are
        prone to confusion. I use a convention that labels the first version
        of any new document with its title and “Version 1.0 draft 1.” The next
        draft keeps the same title but is identified as “ Version 1.0 draft
        2.” The author increments the draft number with each iteration until
        the document is approved and baselined. At that time, the version
        identifier is changed to “Version 1.0 approved,” again keeping the
        same document title. The next version is either “Version 1.1 draft 1”
        for a minor revision or “Version 2.0 draft 1” for a major change. (Of
        course, “major” and “minor” are subjective and depend on the context.)
        This scheme clearly distinguishes between draft and baselined document
        versions, but it does require manual discipline on the part of those
        who modify the documents.</p></div><div class="book" title="Requirement attributes"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3298">Requirement attributes</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Think of each requirement as an object with properties that
        distinguish it from other requirements. In addition to its textual
        description, each requirement should have supporting pieces of
        information or <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">attributes</em></span> associated with it.
        These attributes establish a context and background for each
        requirement. You can store attribute values in a document, a
        spreadsheet, a database, or&mdash;most effectively&mdash;a requirements management
        tool. It’s cumbersome to use more than a couple of requirements
        attributes with documents.</p><p class="calibre3">RM tools typically provide several system-generated attributes
        in addition to letting you define others, some of which can be
        automatically populated. The tools let you query the database to view
        selected subsets of requirements based on their attribute values. For
        instance, you could list all high-priority requirements that were
        assigned to Shari for implementation in release 2.3 and have a status
        of Approved. Following is a list of potential requirement attributes
        to consider:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Date the requirement was created</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Current version number of the requirement</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Author who wrote the requirement</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Priority</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Status</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Origin or source of the requirement</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Rationale behind the requirement</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Release number or iteration to which the requirement is

          measurement devices wanted to track which requirements the team
          included simply because a competitor’s product had the same
          capability. A good way to note such features is with a Rationale
          attribute, which indicates why a specific requirement is included in
          the product. Suppose you included some requirement because it meets
          the need of a particular user group. Later on, your marketing
          department decides they don’t care about that user group any more.
          Having the justification present as a requirement attribute would
          help people decide whether that requirement could be omitted.</p><p class="calibre3">Another BA described his quandary with requirements that had
          no obvious justification. He said, “In my experience, many
          requirements exist without a real need behind them. They are
          introduced because the customer lacks an understanding of the
          technology, or because some key stakeholders get excited about the
          technology and want to show off, or because our sales team
          intentionally or unintentionally has misled the customer.” If you
          can’t provide a convincing rationale for a requirement and trace it
          back to a business need, the BA should question whether there’s a
          real reason to devote effort to it.</p></div><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3300" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Selecting too many requirements attributes can overwhelm a
          team. They won’t supply all attribute values for all requirements
          and won’t use the attribute information effectively. Start with
          perhaps three or four key attributes. Add others only when you know
          how they will add value.</p></div><p class="calibre3">The requirements planned for a release will change as new
        requirements are added and existing ones are deleted or deferred. The
        team might be juggling separate requirements documents for multiple
        releases or iterations. Leaving obsolete requirements in the SRS can
        confuse readers as to whether those requirements are included in that
        baseline. A solution is to store the requirements in an RM tool and
        define a Release Number attribute. Deferring a requirement means
        changing its planned release, so simply updating the release number
        shifts the requirement into a different baseline. Handle deleted and
        rejected requirements by using a status attribute, as described in the
        next section.</p><p class="calibre3">Defining and updating these attribute values is part of the cost
        of requirements management, but that investment can yield a
        significant payback. One company periodically generated a requirements
        report that showed which of the 750 requirements from 3 related
        specifications were assigned to each designer. One designer discovered
        several requirements that she didn’t realize were her responsibility.
        She estimated that she saved one to two months of engineering design
        rework that would have been required had she not found out about those
        requirements until later in the project. The larger the project, the
        easier it is to experience time-wasting miscommunications.</p></div><div class="book" title="Tracking requirements status"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3301">Tracking requirements status</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-860" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1751" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1975" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2205" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2342" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“How are you coming on implementing that

        optimistic when they report how much of a task is complete. The common
        “90 percent done” syndrome doesn’t tell Dave much about how close
        Yvette really is to finishing the subsystem. But suppose Yvette had
        replied, “Pretty good, Dave. Of the 84 requirements for the subsystem,
        61 are implemented and verified, 14 are implemented but not yet
        verified, and I haven’t implemented the other 9 yet.” Tracking the
        status of each functional requirement throughout development provides
        a more precise gauge of project progress.</p><p class="calibre3">Status was one of the requirement attributes proposed in the
        previous section. Tracking status means comparing where you really are
        at a particular time against the expectation of what “complete” means
        for this development cycle. You might have planned to implement only
        certain flows of a use case in the current release, leaving full
        implementation for a future release. Monitor the status of just those
        functional requirements that were committed for the current release,
        because that’s the set that’s supposed to be 100 percent done before
        you declare success and ship the release.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3302" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">There’s an old joke that the first half of a software project

          estimation and overgenerous status tracking constitute a reliable
          formula for project overruns.</p></div><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Table 27-1. Suggested requirement statuses" href="#calibre_link-458">Table&nbsp;27-1</a> lists several

        have been created and reviewed) and Delivered (the software containing
        the requirement is in the hands of the users, as for acceptance or
        beta testing). It’s valuable to keep a record of rejected requirements
        and the reasons they were rejected. Rejected requirements have a way
        of resurfacing later during development or on a future project. The

        portal.” This was the first I had heard of a portal as part of the
        solution, so I asked about it. The stakeholder assured me that the
        COTS package being acquired included a portal component that simply
        had to be configured properly. We hadn’t included any time for portal
        requirements in our plan, so I thought we might have a gap. I asked a
        teammate to record an issue about the portal so we wouldn’t overlook
        that need. I left the project a few weeks later.</p><p class="calibre3">As it turned out, my teammate jotted the portal issue on a
        whiteboard that was later erased; she didn’t record it in our
        issue-tracking tool. Six months into the project, our executive
        stakeholder came to me absolutely furious that no one had elicited
        requirements for the portal. I had to find out why we hadn’t developed
        portal requirements: we simply forgot about it. Recording the issue in
        a tracking tool would have kept us from scrambling at the last minute
        and avoided upsetting the customer.</p></div><div class="book" title="Measuring requirements effort"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3305">Measuring requirements effort</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">As with requirements development, your project plan should
        include tasks and resources for the requirements management activities
        described in this chapter. If you track how much effort you spend on
        requirements development and management activities, you can evaluate
        whether it was too little, about right, or too much, and adjust your
        future planning accordingly. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a> discusses
        measuring various other aspects of the requirements work on a
        project.</p><p class="calibre3">Measuring effort requires a culture change and the individual
        discipline to record daily work activities (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-66">[ref240]</a>). Effort tracking isn’t as time-consuming as
        people sometimes fear. Team members gain valuable insight from knowing
        how they <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">actually</em></span> spent their time, compared to
        how they <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">thought</em></span> they spent their time, compared
        to how they were <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">supposed</em></span> to spend their time.
        Effort tracking also indicates whether the team is performing the
        intended requirements-related activities.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-592" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-641" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1427" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1705" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1952" class="calibre"></a>Note that work effort is not the same as elapsed
        calendar time. Tasks can be interrupted; they might require
        interactions with other people that lead to delays. The total effort
        for a task, in units of labor hours, might not change because of such
        factors (although frequent interruptions do reduce an individual’s
        productivity), but the calendar duration increases.</p><p class="calibre3">When tracking requirements development effort, you might find it
        valuable to separate the time spent by people in the BA role from time
        spent by other project participants. Tracking the BA’s time will help
        you plan how much BA effort is needed on future projects (see <a class="xref" title="Chapter 19. Beyond requirements development" href="#calibre_link-94">Chapter&nbsp;19</a> for more about estimating
        BA time). Measuring the total effort spent on requirements activities
        by all stakeholders gives you a sense of the total cost of
        requirements activities on a project. Record the number of hours spent
        on requirements development activities such as the following:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Planning requirements-related activities for the

        through a series of development iterations and managing a dynamic
        product backlog of work remaining to be done. As described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 2. Requirements from the customer’s perspective" href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>, the
        stakeholders reach agreement on the stories to be implemented in each
        iteration. New stories that customers add while an iteration is under
        way are prioritized against the remaining backlog contents and
        allocated to future iterations. New stories might displace
        lower-priority stories if the team wants to keep the original delivery
        schedule. The goal&mdash;as it should be for all projects&mdash;is to always be
        working on the highest-priority stories to deliver the maximum value
        to customers as quickly as possible. See <a class="xref" title="Chapter 28. Change happens" href="#calibre_link-72">Chapter&nbsp;28</a> for more information about handling

        associated acceptance criteria and acceptance tests might all be
        placed in a product backlog or user story&ndash;management tool. Story
        status can be monitored by using statuses analogous to those described
        earlier in <a class="xref" title="Table 27-1. Suggested requirement statuses" href="#calibre_link-458">Table&nbsp;27-1</a> (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-93">[ref157]</a>):</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">In backlog (the story is not yet allocated to an

        do on the project, often sized in units of story points, which are
        derived from an understanding of the user stories in the product
        backlog (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-361">[ref044]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-93">[ref157]</a>). The
        story point total is thus proportional to the amount of effort the
        team must expend to implement the requirements. The team allocates
        certain user stories to each iteration based on their priority and
        their estimated size in story points. The team’s past or average
        velocity dictates the number of story points the team plans to deliver
        in an iteration of a particular calendar duration.</p><p class="calibre3">The team charts the story points remaining in the product
        backlog at the end of each iteration. This total will change as work
        is completed, as current stories are better understood and
        re-estimated, as new stories are added, and as customers remove
        pending work from the backlog. That is, rather than monitoring the
        count and status of individual functional requirements or features
        (which can come in a variety of sizes), the burndown chart shows the
        total work remaining to be done at a specific time.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 27-3. Sample iteration burndown chart for monitoring the product backlog on an agile project." href="#calibre_link-462">Figure&nbsp;27-3</a>
        illustrates a burndown chart for a hypothetical project. Notice that
        the scope remaining, as measured in story points, actually increased
        in iterations 2, 3, and 5. This indicates that more new functionality
        was added to the backlog than was completed or removed during the
        course of the iteration. The burndown chart helps the team avoid the
        “90 percent done” syndrome by making visible the amount of work
        remaining, as opposed to the amount of work completed, which doesn’t
        reflect the inevitable scope increases. The slope of the burndown
        chart also reveals the projected end date for the project, the point
        at which no work remains in the backlog.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-462" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3307" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000102.jpeg" alt="A graph that shows story points on the y-axis and               iteration number on the x axis going from 1 through 10.

        Requirements management helps to ensure that the effort you invest in
        requirements development isn’t squandered. Effective requirements
        management reduces the expectation gap by keeping all project
        stakeholders informed about the current state of the requirements
        throughout the development process. It lets you know where you’re

      realize I missed a change needed in another file, so I have to fix that,
      rebuild the component, and test it again. I thought this would take
      about six hours, but I’ve spent almost three days on it so far. I know
      I’m holding up the next build. Should I finish adding this query
      function or go back to what I was working on before?”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">Most developers have encountered an apparently simple change that
      turned out to be far more complicated than expected. Developers
      sometimes don’t&mdash;or can’t&mdash;produce realistic estimates of the cost and
      other ramifications of a proposed software change. Additionally, when
      developers who want to be accommodating agree to add enhancements that
      users request, requirements changes slip in through the back door
      instead of being approved by the right stakeholders. Such uncontrolled
      change is a common source of project chaos, schedule slips, quality
      problems, and hard feelings. This chapter describes both formal change
      control practices and how agile projects incorporate changes.</p><div class="book" title="Why manage changes?"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3311">Why manage changes?</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Software change isn’t a bad thing; in fact, it’s necessary. It’s
        virtually impossible to define all of a product’s requirements up
        front. The world changes as development progresses: new market
        opportunities arise, regulations and policies change, and business
        needs evolve. An effective software team can nimbly respond to
        necessary changes so that the product they build provides timely
        customer value. An organization that’s serious about managing its
        software projects must ensure that:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Proposed requirements changes are thoughtfully evaluated
            before being committed to.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Appropriate individuals make informed business decisions

            participants.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The project incorporates requirements changes in a
            consistent and effective fashion.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">But change always has a price. Revising a simple webpage might
        be quick and easy; making a change in an integrated circuit design can
        cost tens of thousands of dollars. Even a rejected change request
        consumes the time needed to submit, evaluate, and decide to reject it.
        Unless project stakeholders manage changes during development, they
        won’t really know what will be delivered, which ultimately leads to an
        expectation gap.</p><p class="calibre3">Problems can also arise if a developer implements a requirement
        change directly in the code without communicating with other team
        members. The documented requirements then become an inaccurate
        representation of what the product does. The code can become brittle
        if changes are made without respecting the architecture and design
        structure. On one project, developers introduced new and modified
        functionality that the rest of the team didn’t discover until system
        testing. They didn’t expect that functionality, and they didn’t know
        how to test it. This required unplanned rework of test procedures and
        user documentation. Consistent change control practices help prevent
        such problems and the associated frustration, rework, and wasted
        time.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3312" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Beware subversive changes</div><p class="calibre3">A vendor and a customer once caused havoc when they bypassed
          the change process on a contracted project. The vendor (vetted by
          the IT department, but hired by the business area) was to develop a
          new mobile workstation application. Requirements were elicited
          collaboratively with 10 subject matter experts. Then the lead
          customer from the business area decided that she wanted more
          requirements changes. Not trusting that the revisions would be
          funded, she colluded with the vendor’s developers to subvert the
          agreed-upon requirements. They rented a hotel room and worked in
          secret, making changes to the code on the fly. When testers found
          that the deliverable didn’t match the requirements, the whole story
          came out. Backtracking the changes and expected outcomes cost the
          organization considerable time and effort.</p><p class="calibre3">By a strange twist of fate, that lead customer later became a
          business analyst. She took the time to apologize, because only then
          did she come to understand how her actions had undermined the rest
          of the team.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Managing scope creep"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3313">Managing scope creep</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">In an ideal world, you would document all of a new system’s
        requirements before beginning construction, and they’d remain stable
        throughout the development effort. This is the premise behind the pure
        waterfall development model, but it doesn’t work well in practice. At
        some point, you must freeze the requirements for a specific release or
        development iteration or you’ll never finish it. However, stifling
        change prematurely ignores the realities that customers aren’t always
        sure what they need, business needs change, and developers want to
        respond to those changes.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1118" class="calibre"></a>Requirements growth includes new functionality and
        significant modifications that are presented after a set of
        requirements has been baselined (see <a class="xref" title="Chapter 2. Requirements from the customer’s perspective" href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>). The longer a
        project goes on, the more growth it experiences. The requirements for
        software systems typically grow between 1 percent and 3 percent per
        calendar month (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-464">[ref133]</a>). Some requirements
        evolution is legitimate, unavoidable, and even advantageous. Scope
        creep, though, in which the project continuously incorporates more
        functionality without adjusting resources, schedules, or quality
        goals, is insidious. The problem is not that requirements change but
        that late changes can have a big impact on work already performed. If
        every proposed change is approved, it might appear to stakeholders
        that the software will never be delivered&mdash;and indeed, it might
        not.</p><p class="calibre3">The first step in managing scope creep is to document the
        business objectives, product vision, project scope, and limitations of
        the new system, as described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 5. Establishing the business requirements" href="#calibre_link-32">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>. Evaluate every
        proposed requirement or feature against the business requirements.
        Engaging customers in elicitation reduces the number of requirements
        that are overlooked. Prototyping helps to control scope creep by
        helping developers and users share a clear understanding of user needs
        and prospective solutions. Using short development cycles to release a
        system incrementally provides frequent opportunities for
        adjustments.</p><p class="calibre3">The most effective technique for controlling scope creep is the
        ability to say “no” (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-465">[ref239]</a>). People don’t like to
        say “no,” and development teams can receive intense pressure to always
        say “yes.” Philosophies such as “the customer is always right” or “we
        will achieve total customer satisfaction” are fine in the abstract,
        but you pay a price for them. Ignoring the price doesn’t alter the
        fact that change is not free. The president of one software tool
        vendor is accustomed to hearing the development manager say “not now”
        when he suggests a new feature. “Not now” is more palatable than a
        simple rejection. It holds the promise of including the feature in a
        subsequent release.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3314" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Freezing the requirements for a new system too soon after
          initial elicitation activities is unwise and unrealistic. Instead,
          establish a baseline when you think a set of requirements is well
          enough defined for construction to begin, and then manage changes to
          minimize their adverse impact on the project.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Change control policy"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3315">Change control policy</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-784" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-785" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-808" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-848" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1757" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2080" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2339" class="calibre"></a>Management should communicate a policy that states its

            considered.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">No design or implementation work other than feasibility
            exploration will be performed on unapproved changes.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Simply requesting a change does not guarantee that it will
            be made. The project’s change control board (CCB) will decide
            which changes to implement.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The contents of the change database must be visible to all
            project stakeholders.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Impact analysis must be performed for every change.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Every incorporated change must be traceable to an approved
            change request.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The rationale behind every approval or rejection of a change
            request must be recorded.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Of course, tiny changes will hardly affect the project, and big
        changes will have a significant impact. In practice, you might decide
        to leave certain requirements decisions to the developers’ discretion,
        but no change affecting more than one individual’s work should bypass
        your process. Include a “fast path” to expedite low-risk,
        low-investment change requests in a compressed decision cycle.</p></div><div class="book" title="Basic concepts of the change control process"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3316">Basic concepts of the change control process</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">When performing a software process assessment, I asked a project
        team how they handled requirements changes. After an awkward silence,
        one person said, “Whenever the marketing representative wants to make
        a change, he asks Bruce or Robin because they always say ‘yes.’ The
        rest of us push back about changes.” This didn’t strike me as a great
        change process.</p><p class="calibre3">A sensible change control process lets the project’s leaders
        make informed business decisions that will provide the greatest
        customer and business value while controlling the product’s life-cycle
        cost and the project’s schedule. The process lets you track the status
        of all proposed changes, and it helps ensure that suggested changes
        aren’t lost or overlooked. After you’ve baselined a set of
        requirements, you should follow this process for all proposed changes
        to that baseline.</p><p class="calibre3">Stakeholders sometimes balk at being asked to follow a new
        process, but a change control process is not an obstacle to making
        necessary modifications. It’s a funneling and filtering mechanism to
        ensure that the project expeditiously incorporates the most
        appropriate changes. If a proposed change isn’t important enough for a
        stakeholder to take just a couple of minutes to submit it through a
        standard, simple channel, then it’s not worth considering for
        inclusion. Your change process should be well documented, as simple as
        possible, and&mdash;above all&mdash;effective.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3317" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1153" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1188" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2257" class="calibre"></a>If you ask your stakeholders to follow a new change
          control process that’s ineffective, cumbersome, or too complicated,
          people will find ways to bypass the process&mdash;and they should.</p></div><p class="calibre3">Managing requirements changes is similar to the process for
        collecting and making decisions about defect reports. The same tools
        can support both activities. Remember, though: a tool is not a
        substitute for a documented process, and neither one is a substitute
        for appropriate discussions between stakeholders. Regard both a tool
        and a written process as ways to support these critical
        conversations.</p><p class="calibre3">When you need to incorporate a change, start at the highest
        level of abstraction that the change touches and cascade the change
        through affected system components. For example, a proposed change
        might affect a user requirement but not any business requirements.
        Modifying a high-level system requirement could affect numerous
        software and hardware requirements in multiple subsystems. Some
        changes pertain only to system internals, such as the way a
        communication service is implemented. These aren’t user-visible
        requirements changes, but rather design or code changes.</p></div><div class="book" title="A change control process description"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3318">A change control process description</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 28-1. Sample template for a change control process description." href="#calibre_link-466">Figure&nbsp;28-1</a>

            cost, and alignment with the project’s business requirements and
            resource constraints. The CCB Chair might assign an Evaluator to
            perform impact analysis, risk and hazard analysis, or other
            assessments. (See the “Change impact analysis” section later in
            this chapter.) This ensures that the consequences of accepting the
            change are understood. The Evaluator and the CCB should also
            consider the business and technical implications, if any, of
            rejecting the request.</p></div><div class="book" title="5.2 Make change decision"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-3327">5.2 Make change decision</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The appropriate decision makers, chartered as the CCB, then
            decide whether to approve or reject the change. The CCB gives each
            approved change a priority or target implementation date, or it
            allocates the change to a specific iteration or release. It might
            simply add a new requirement to the product backlog of pending
            work. The CCB updates the request’s status and notifies all

            changes made in various downstream work products through testing
            or review. After verification is complete, the Modifier stores
            updated work products in the appropriate locations per the

        body of people&mdash;whether it is one individual or a diverse group&mdash;that
        decides which proposed changes and new requirements to accept, which
        to accept with revisions, and which to reject. The CCB also decides
        which reported defects to correct and when to correct them. Some CCBs
        are empowered to make decisions, whereas others can only make
        recommendations for management decision. Projects always have some de
        facto group that makes change decisions. Establishing a CCB formalizes
        this group’s composition and authority and defines its operating
        procedures.</p><p class="calibre3">To some people, the term “change control board” conjures an
        image of wasteful bureaucratic overhead. Instead, think of the CCB as
        providing a valuable structure to help manage even a small project. On
        a small project, it makes sense to have only one or two people make
        the change decisions. Very large projects or programs might have
        several levels of CCBs, some responsible for business decisions, such
        as requirements changes, and some for technical changes. A large
        program that encompasses multiple projects would establish a
        program-level CCB and an individual CCB for each project. Each project
        CCB resolves issues and changes that affect only that project. Issues
        that affect multiple projects and changes that exceed a specified cost
        or schedule impact are escalated to the program-level CCB.</p><div class="book" title="CCB composition"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3334">CCB composition</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The CCB membership should represent all groups who need to
          participate in making decisions within the scope of that CCB’s
          authority. Consider selecting representatives from the following
          areas:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Project or program management</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Business analysis or product management</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Development</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Testing or quality assurance</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Marketing, the business for which the application is being

          will be part of the CCB, although all stakeholders must be informed
          of decisions that affect their work. The CCB for a project with both
          software and hardware components might also include representatives
          from hardware engineering, systems engineering, and/or
          manufacturing. Keep the CCB small so the group can respond promptly
          and efficiently to change requests. Make sure the CCB members
          understand and accept their responsibilities. Invite other
          individuals to CCB meetings as necessary to ensure that the group
          has adequate technical and business information.</p></div><div class="book" title="CCB charter"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3335">CCB charter</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-776" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2255" class="calibre"></a>All of the project teams in an organization can follow
          the same change control process. However, their CCBs might function
          in different ways. Each project should create a brief charter (which
          could be part of the project management plan) that describes its
          CCB’s purpose, scope of authority, membership, operating procedures,
          and decision-making process (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-470">[ref224]</a>). A template
          for a CCB charter is available for downloading from this book’s
          companion content website. The charter should state the frequency of
          regularly scheduled CCB meetings and the conditions that trigger a
          special meeting or decision. The scope of the CCB’s authority
          indicates which decisions it can make and which ones it must

            improving the product could include financial savings, increased

        having each state at any given time. Because the available tools,
        their vendors, and their features frequently change, we don’t provide
        specific tool recommendations here. To support your change process,
        look for a tool that:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Allows you to define the attributes that constitute a change

        pertinent change request.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3341" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Tooling up a process</div><p class="calibre3">When I worked on a web development team, one of our first
          process improvements was to implement a change control process to
          manage our huge backlog of change requests (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-471">[ref243]</a>). We began with a process like the one described
          in this chapter. We piloted it for a few weeks by using paper forms
          while I evaluated several issue-tracking tools. During the pilot
          process we discovered ways to improve the process and additional
          data attributes for the change requests. We selected a highly
          configurable tool and tailored it to match our process. The team
          used this process and tool to handle requirements changes in systems
          under development, defect reports and suggested enhancements for
          production systems, and requests for new projects. Change control
          was one of our most successful process improvement
          initiatives.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Measuring change activity"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3342">Measuring change activity</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-792" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-798" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-799" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1477" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1485" class="calibre"></a>Measuring change activity is a way to assess the
        stability of the requirements. It also reveals opportunities for
        process improvements that might lead to fewer changes in the future.
        Consider tracking the following aspects of your requirements change
        activity:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The total number of change requests received, currently
            open, and closed</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The cumulative number of added, deleted, and modified
            requirements</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The number of requests that originated from each change
            origin</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The number of changes received against each requirement
            since it was baselined</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The total effort devoted to processing and implementing
            change requests</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">You don’t necessarily need to monitor your requirements change
        activities to this degree. As with all software metrics, understand
        your goals and how you’ll use the data before you decide what to
        measure (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-57">[ref248]</a>). Start with simple metrics to
        begin establishing a measurement culture in your organization and to
        collect the data you need to manage your projects effectively.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 28-3. Sample chart of requirements change activity." href="#calibre_link-472">Figure&nbsp;28-3</a>
        illustrates a way to track the amount of requirements change your
        project experiences during development (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>).
        This requirements volatility chart tracks the rate at which new
        proposals for requirements changes arrive after a baseline was
        established. This chart should trend toward zero as you approach
        release. A sustained high frequency of changes implies a risk of
        failing to meet your schedule commitments. It probably also indicates
        that the original requirements set was incomplete; better elicitation
        practices might be in order.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-472" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3343" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000105.gif" alt="A graph that shows the number of weeks after baselining               requirements on the x-axis and the number of newly proposed               changes on the y-axis.

        way to represent the number of change requests that came from
        different sources. The project manager could discuss a chart like this
        with the marketing manager and point out that marketing has requested
        the most requirements changes. This might lead to a fruitful
        discussion about actions the team could take to reduce the number of
        changes received from marketing in the future or better ways to handle
        them. Using data as a starting point for such discussions is more
        constructive than holding a confrontational debate fueled by emotion.

        the text of one error message in its product. What could be simpler?
        The product was available in both English-language and German-language
        versions. There were no problems in English, but in German the new
        message exceeded the maximum character length allocated for error
        message displays in both the message box and a database. Coping with
        this seemingly simple change request turned out to be much more work
        than the developer had anticipated when he promised a quick
        turnaround.</p><p class="calibre3">Impact analysis is a key aspect of responsible requirements
        management (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-474">[ref010]</a>). It provides an accurate
        understanding of the implications of a proposed change, which helps
        the team make informed business decisions about which proposals to
        approve. The analysis examines the request to identify components that
        might have to be created, modified, or discarded, and to estimate the
        effort required to implement the change. Before a developer says,
        “Sure, no problem” in response to a change request, he should spend a
        little time on impact analysis.</p><div class="book" title="Impact analysis procedure"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3346">Impact analysis procedure</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The CCB Chair will ask one or more technical people (business

          evaluating the impact of a proposed requirement change:</p><div class="book"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1"><p class="calibre3">Work through the checklist in <a class="xref" title="Figure 28-5. Questions to understand the possible implications of a proposed change." href="#calibre_link-475">Figure&nbsp;28-5</a>.</p></li><li class="listitem" value="2"><p class="calibre3">Work through the checklist in <a class="xref" title="Figure 28-6. Checklist to determine work products that might be affected by a proposed change." href="#calibre_link-476">Figure&nbsp;28-6</a>. Some
              requirements management tools include an impact analysis report
              that follows traceability links and finds the system elements
              that depend on the requirements affected by a change
              request.</p></li><li class="listitem" value="3"><p class="calibre3">Use the worksheet in <a class="xref" title="Figure 28-7. Worksheet for estimating effort of a requirement change." href="#calibre_link-477">Figure&nbsp;28-7</a> to
              estimate the effort required for the anticipated tasks. Most
              change requests will require only a portion of the tasks on the
              worksheet.</p></li><li class="listitem" value="4"><p class="calibre3">Sum the effort estimates.</p></li><li class="listitem" value="5"><p class="calibre3">Identify the sequence in which the tasks must be performed

          couple of hours to complete for a single change request. This seems
          like a lot of time to a busy developer, but it’s a small investment
          in making sure the project wisely invests its limited resources. To
          improve your future impact analysis, compare the actual effort
          needed to implement each change with the estimated effort.
          Understand the reasons for any differences, and modify the impact
          estimation checklists and worksheet to help ensure that future
          impact analyses are more accurate.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3352" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Money down the drain</div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-568" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-782" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2258" class="calibre"></a>Two developers at the A.

            that it would take four weeks to add an enhancement to one of
            their information systems. The customer approved the estimate, and
            the developers set to work. After two months, the enhancement was
            only about half done and the customer lost patience: “If I’d known
            how long this was really going to take and how much it was going
            to cost, I wouldn’t have approved it. Let’s forget the whole
            thing.” In the rush to begin implementation, the developers didn’t
            do enough impact analysis to develop a reliable estimate that
            would let the customer make a good business decision.
            Consequently, the company wasted several hundred hours of work
            that could have been avoided with a few hours of impact

        even welcome&mdash;scope changes. One of the 12 principles of agile software
        development is “Welcome changing requirements, even late in
        development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s
        competitive advantage” (<span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4"><a class="xref" href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_top">www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html</a></em></span>).
        This principle acknowledges the reality that requirements changes are
        inevitable, necessary, and often valuable. Accepting change helps to
        meet evolving business objectives and priorities and to accommodate
        the limitations of human plans and foresight.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-565" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-583" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-642" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1428" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2458" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2470" class="calibre"></a>Agile projects manage change by maintaining a dynamic
        backlog of work to be done (see <a class="xref" title="Figure 28-9. Agile projects manage change with a dynamic product backlog." href="#calibre_link-479">Figure&nbsp;28-9</a>). “Work”
        includes user stories yet to be implemented, defects to be corrected,
        business process changes to be addressed, training to be developed and
        delivered, and the myriad other activities involved with any software
        project. Each iteration implements the set of work items in the
        backlog that have the highest priority at that time. As stakeholders
        request new work, it goes into the backlog and is prioritized against
        the other backlog contents. Work that has not yet been allocated can
        be reprioritized or removed from the backlog at any time. A new,
        high-priority story could be allocated to the forthcoming iteration,
        forcing a lower-priority story of about the same size to be deferred
        to a later iteration. Carefully managing the scope of each iteration
        ensures that it is completed on time and with high quality.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-479" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3355" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000111.jpeg" alt="A horizontal rectangle represents the prioritized               product backlog.

Two arrows coming into the               backlog are labeled new requirement or task. An arrow going out               of the backlog is labeled deleted requirement or task. Curved               arrows indicate the movement within the backlog of reprioritized               requirements or tasks." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;28-9.&nbsp;Agile projects manage change with a dynamic product
          backlog.</div></div><p class="calibre3">Because of the iterative nature of agile projects, every few
        weeks there will be an opportunity to select a set of work items from
        the backlog for the next development iteration. Agile teams vary as to
        whether new work that arrives during an iteration is always deferred
        to a future iteration, or whether they can modify the contents of the
        current iteration. Keeping the contents of an iteration frozen while
        it is under way provides stability for developers and predictability
        regarding what stakeholders can expect out of the iteration. On the
        other hand, adjusting the iteration’s contents makes the team more
        responsive to customer needs.</p><p class="calibre3">Agile methods vary as to their philosophy on this point; there
        is no single “correct” approach. Either freeze the baseline for an
        iteration once it is under way or introduce high-priority changes as
        soon as you learn about them, whatever you think will work best for
        your team and the project’s business objectives. The basic principle
        is to avoid both excessive change (churning requirements) and
        excessive rigidity (frozen requirements) within an iteration. One
        solution is to set the iteration length to the right duration for
        keeping most change out of the current iteration. That is, if changes
        need to be introduced too often, the standard iteration length might
        need to be shortened.</p><p class="calibre3">All agile methods define a role representing the end-user and
        customer constituencies. In Scrum this is the product owner role; in
        Extreme Programming this is the customer role. The customer or product
        owner has primary responsibility for prioritizing the contents of the
        product backlog. He also makes decisions to accept proposed
        requirements changes, based on their alignment with the overarching
        product vision and the business value they will enable (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-104">[ref045]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3">Because an agile team is a collaborative and cross-functional
        group of developers, testers, a business analyst, a project manager,
        and others, the team is already configured like the change control
        board discussed earlier in the chapter. The short duration of agile
        iterations and the small increment of product delivered in each
        iteration allows agile teams to perform change control frequently but
        on a limited scale. However, even agile projects must evaluate the
        potential cost of changes in requirements and their impact on product
        components. Scope changes that could affect the overall cost or
        duration of the project need to be escalated to a higher-level change
        authority, such as the project sponsor (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-480">[ref230]</a>).</p><p class="calibre3">No matter what kind of project you’re working on or what
        development life cycle your team is following, change is going to
        happen. You need to expect it and be prepared to handle it.
        Disciplined change-management practices can reduce the disruption that
        changes can cause. The purpose of change control is not to inhibit
        change, nor to inhibit stakeholders from proposing changes. It is to
        provide visibility into change activity and mechanisms by which the
        right people can consider proposed changes and incorporate appropriate
        ones into the project at the right time. This will maximize the
        business value and minimize the negative impact of changes on the
        team.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3356" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Next steps</div><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Identify the decision makers on your project, and set them

      requirement. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 28. Change happens" href="#calibre_link-72">Chapter&nbsp;28</a> discussed the importance
      of performing an impact analysis to make sure the team knows what it’s
      getting into before it commits to implementing a proposed change. Change
      impact analysis is easier if you have a road map that shows where each
      requirement or business rule was implemented in the software.</p><p class="calibre3">This chapter addresses the subject of requirements tracing (or
      traceability). Requirements trace information documents the dependencies
      and logical links between individual requirements and other system
      elements. These elements include other requirements of various types,
      business rules, architecture and other design components, source code
      modules, tests, and help files. Trace information facilitates impact
      analysis by helping you identify all the work products you might have to
      modify to implement a proposed requirement change.</p><div class="book" title="Tracing requirements"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3358">Tracing requirements</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Trace links allow you to follow the life of a requirement both
        forward and backward, from origin through implementation. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 11. Writing excellent requirements" href="#calibre_link-59">Chapter&nbsp;11</a> identified traceability as
        one of the characteristics of excellent requirements. (Note that being
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">traceable</em></span>&mdash;having the properties to facilitate
        tracing&mdash;is not the same as being <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">traced</em></span>&mdash;actually
        having logical links between requirements and other elements
        recorded.) For requirements to be traceable, each one must be uniquely
        and persistently labeled so that you can refer to it unambiguously
        throughout the project. Write the requirements in a fine-grained
        fashion, rather than creating large paragraphs containing many
        individual functional requirements that readers have to parse
        out.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 29-1. Four types of requirements tracing." href="#calibre_link-482">Figure&nbsp;29-1</a>
        illustrates four types of requirements trace links (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-483">[ref127]</a>). Customer needs are traced <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">forward to
        requirements</em></span>, so you can tell which requirements will be
        affected if those needs change during or after development. Customer
        needs could be articulated in the form of business objectives, market
        demands, and/or user requirements. A complete set of forward traces
        also gives you confidence that the requirements set has addressed all
        stated customer needs. Conversely, you can trace <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">backward
        from requirements</em></span> to customer needs to identify the origin
        of each software requirement. If you choose to represent customer
        needs in the form of use cases, the top half of <a class="xref" title="Figure 29-1. Four types of requirements tracing." href="#calibre_link-482">Figure&nbsp;29-1</a> illustrates tracing
        between use cases and functional requirements.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-482" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3359" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000112.gif" alt="Four types of requirements tracing." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;29-1.&nbsp;Four types of requirements tracing.</div></div><p class="calibre3">The bottom half of <a class="xref" title="Figure 29-1. Four types of requirements tracing." href="#calibre_link-482">Figure&nbsp;29-1</a> indicates that, as
        requirements flow into downstream deliverables during development, you
        can trace <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">forward from requirements</em></span> by defining
        links between individual functional and nonfunctional requirements and
        specific system elements. This type of link allows you to determine
        that you’ve satisfied every requirement because you know which design
        components and code elements address each one. The fourth type of link
        traces specific product elements <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">backward to
        requirements</em></span> so that you know why each element was created.
        Most applications include some scaffolding or enabling code, such as
        for testing, that doesn’t relate directly to user-specified
        requirements, but you should know why each line of code was
        written.</p><p class="calibre3">Suppose a tester encounters unexpected functionality with no
        corresponding written requirement. This code could indicate that a
        developer implemented a legitimate implied or verbally communicated
        requirement that the business analyst can now add to the requirements
        set. Alternatively, it might be “orphan code,” an instance of
        gold-plating that doesn’t belong in the product. Trace links can help
        you sort out these kinds of situations and build a more complete
        picture of how the pieces of your system fit together. Conversely,
        tests that are derived from&mdash;and traced back to&mdash;individual requirements
        provide a mechanism for detecting unimplemented requirements, because
        the expected functionality will be missing from the system being
        tested. Trace links also help you keep track of parentage,
        interconnections, and dependencies among individual requirements. This
        information reveals the propagation of change that can result when a
        particular requirement is deleted or modified.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 29-2. Some possible requirements trace links." href="#calibre_link-484">Figure&nbsp;29-2</a>
        illustrates many kinds of traceability relationships that can be

        all these trace link types. On many projects, you can gain most of the
        traceability benefits you want for just a fraction of the potential
        effort. Maybe you only need to trace system tests back to functional
        requirements or user requirements. Perform a cost-benefit analysis to
        decide which links will contribute to the success of your project,
        both in terms of development and long-term maintenance effort. Don’t

        Overlooking a requirement is more than an embarrassment if it means a
        customer isn’t satisfied or a product is missing a critical function.
        Requirements tracing provides a way to demonstrate compliance with a
        specification, contract, or regulation. At an organization level,
        implementing requirements tracing can improve the quality of your
        products, reduce maintenance costs, and facilitate reuse.</p><p class="calibre3">Keeping the link information current as the system undergoes
        development and maintenance takes discipline and time. If the trace
        information becomes obsolete, you’ll probably never reconstruct it.
        Obsolete or inaccurate trace data wastes time by sending developers
        and maintainers down the wrong path, destroying any trust the
        developers might have had in the information. Because of these
        realities, you should adopt requirements tracing for the right reasons
        (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-485">[ref196]</a>). Following are some potential benefits of
        implementing requirements tracing:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p title="Finding missing requirements" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Finding missing

        can be class methods, stored procedures, source code file names, or

              you’ll capture all these interconnections, but in practice,

        the language features that the programmer uses but might not result in
        specific code segments that enable portability. Other quality
        attributes are indeed implemented in code. Security requirements for
        user authentication lead to derived functional requirements that might
        be implemented through passwords or biometrics functionality. In those

        requirements of the same kind. Some tools let you differentiate
        traced-to and traced-from relationships, automatically defining the
        complementary links. That is, if you indicate that requirement R is
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">traced to</em></span> test T, the tool will also show the
        symmetrical relationship in which T is <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">traced
        from</em></span> R.</p><p class="calibre3">Some tools automatically flag a trace link as being
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">suspect</em></span> whenever the object on either end of the
        link is modified. A suspect link displays a visual indicator (such as
        a red question mark or a diagonal red line) in the corresponding cell
        in the requirements traceability matrix. For example, if you changed
        Use Case 3, the requirements traceability matrix in <a class="xref" title="Table 29-2. Requirements traceability matrix showing links between use cases and functional requirements" href="#calibre_link-486">Table&nbsp;29-2</a> might look like
        <a class="xref" title="Table 29-4. Suspect links in a requirements traceability matrix" href="#calibre_link-489">Table&nbsp;29-4</a> the next
        time you see it. The suspect link indicators (in this case, question
        marks) tell you to check whether functional requirements 3, 4, and 6
        need to be changed to remain consistent with the modified UC-3. After
        making any necessary changes, you clear the suspect link indicators
        manually. This process helps ensure that you’ve accounted for the
        known ripple effects of a change.</p><div class="table"><a id="calibre_link-489" class="calibre"></a><div class="table-title">Table&nbsp;29-4.&nbsp;Suspect links in a requirements traceability matrix</div><div class="book"><table class="calibre7"><colgroup class="calibre8"><col class="col"></col><col class="col"></col><col class="col"></col><col class="col"></col><col class="col"></col></colgroup><tbody class="calibre9"><tr class="calibre10"><td class="calibre22">&nbsp;</td><td colspan="4" class="calibre36"><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Use

        cross-project or cross-subsystem links. I know of one large software
        product that had 20 major subsystems, with certain high-level system
        requirements apportioned among multiple subsystems. In some cases, a
        requirement that was allocated to one subsystem was actually
        implemented through a service that another subsystem provided. This
        project used a requirements management tool to successfully track
        these complex trace relationships.</p><p class="calibre3">It’s impossible to perform requirements tracing manually for any
        but very small applications. You can use a spreadsheet to maintain
        trace data for up to a couple hundred requirements, but larger systems
        demand a more robust solution. Requirements tracing can’t be fully
        automated because the knowledge of the links originates in the
        development team members’ minds. However, after you’ve identified the
        links, tools can help you manage the vast quantity of trace

            mechanism for storing the data: a table in a text document, a

        collect trace information at the outset of a new project. If you’re
        maintaining an existing system, you probably don’t have trace data
        available. There’s no time like the present to begin accumulating this
        information. The next time you add an enhancement or make a
        modification, write down what you discover about connections between
        code, tests, designs, and requirements. You’ll never reconstruct a
        complete requirements traceability matrix, but this small amount of
        effort might make it easier the next time someone needs to work on
        that same part of the system.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3383" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Best approached with caffeine and music</div><p class="calibre3">My friend Sonoko, a highly experienced software developer who
          works on credit-card transaction processing systems, recently sent
          me an email message. “I thought you’d be amused to know that I’ve
          spent the afternoon creating a requirements traceability matrix for
          one of my projects, and I’m about to die of tedium,” Sonoko said.
          “The requirements spec was 30 pages long, my technical design is 100
          pages long, and the matrix is therefore hefty. I know that we have
          to do them, but I fell asleep two hours ago.”</p><p class="calibre3">I asked Sonoko some follow-up questions to better understand
          what she was doing. “Since I make my technical designs available to
          the business analyst, affected business areas, and project manager,
          the traceability matrix proves to them that I addressed every
          requirement they gave me,” she replied. “In my design review, I
          present the design by walking through the traceability matrix, which
          is logically sequenced by requirement.” I asked Sonoko why she was
          taking the time to create this traceability matrix. She said, “I
          create it because it ensures that I cover everything, and it
          provides a quick way for me to see all of the system elements that a
          given requirement affects.”</p><p class="calibre3">After working for decades in the software industry, Sonoko
          clearly understands the value that linking requirements to affected
          design elements can provide. But, as she points out, it’s not a fun
          chore to wade through such a large volume of information and link
          the bits together. If the way she approaches technical design
          permits, it would save time to begin aggregating the trace
          information as her design begins to stabilize, instead of at the
          end.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Is requirements tracing feasible? Is it necessary?"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3384">Is requirements tracing feasible? Is it necessary?</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">You might conclude that accumulating requirements trace
        information is more expensive than it’s worth or that it’s not
        feasible for your project. That’s entirely possible. Acquiring a tool
        with the necessary capabilities, setting it up, entering the data, and
        keeping it current is expensive and time consuming. You might not need
        to construct a group memory like this if members of your team possess
        the necessary knowledge and share it with others when it’s needed.
        Only your team can decide whether requirements tracing&mdash;be it just
        requirements-to-tests or something more elaborate&mdash;adds value to your
        project above its cost.</p><p class="calibre3">Consider the following example, though. A conference attendee
        who worked at an aircraft manufacturer told me that the SRS for his
        team’s part of the company’s latest jetliner was a stack of paper six
        feet thick. They had a complete requirements traceability matrix. I’ve
        flown on that very model of airplane, and I was happy to hear that the
        developers had managed their software requirements so carefully.
        Managing traces on a huge product with many interrelated subsystems is
        a lot of work. This aircraft manufacturer knows it is essential. The
        U.S. Federal Aviation Administration agrees: traceability from
        requirements to designs is required for certification of aviation
        software. Similarly, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration advocates
        that medical device manufacturers demonstrate traceability of a
        product’s requirements into downstream deliverables as part of the
        validation process for the device.</p><p class="calibre3">Even if your products won’t cause loss of life or limb if they
        fail, you should take requirements tracing seriously. At a minimum,
        consider tracing between business requirements and user requirements
        to look for alignment, omissions, and unnecessary requirements. The
        CEO of a major corporation who was present when I described
        requirements tracing at a seminar asked, “Why
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">wouldn’t</em></span> you do this for your strategic business
        systems?” That’s an excellent question. You should decide to use any
        improved requirements engineering practice based on both the costs of
        applying the technique and the risks of <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">not</em></span> using
        it. As with all software processes, make an economic decision to
        invest your valuable time where you expect the greatest
        payback.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3385" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Next steps</div><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Set up a trace matrix for 15 or 20 requirements from an

              the approaches shown in both Tables 29-1 and 29-2. Populate the
              matrix as the project progresses for a few weeks. Evaluate which
              method seems most effective and what procedures for collecting
              and storing traceability information will work for your
              team.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">The next time you perform maintenance on a poorly
              documented system, record what you learn from reverse
              engineering the part of the product you’re modifying. Build a
              fragment of a requirements traceability matrix for the piece of
              the puzzle you’re manipulating so that the next time someone has
              to work on it they have a head start. Grow the matrix as your
              team continues to maintain the product.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Trace your functional requirements back to user
              requirements, and trace your user requirements to business
              requirements. Count the requirements that you could cut because
              they don’t link back to a business requirement. Count the
              requirements that were missing until the trace matrix revealed
              their absence. Estimate the costs had you not discovered these
              requirements errors until much later in the project. This
              analysis will help you judge whether requirements tracing will
              pay off in your environment.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></section></div>

      not easy to keep track of which requirements are scheduled for which
      release, because they are all stored in the same document. Estelle would
      like to know the status of requirements that are already under

      natural-language software requirements specification to contain the
      functional and nonfunctional requirements, as well as documents that
      contain the business requirements and user requirements. We pointed out
      that these deliverables are just containers for sets of requirements
      information; they need not be traditional word-processing documents.
      Although still widely used, a document-based approach to developing and
      managing requirements has numerous limitations, including the
      following:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">It’s difficult to keep the documents current and

          planned for different releases or for related products is tricky.

      (RM) tools provide solutions to all of these limitations. RD tools can
      help you elicit the right requirements for your project and judge
      whether those requirements are well-written. RM tools help you manage
      changes to those requirements, track status, and trace requirements to
      other project deliverables.</p><p class="calibre3">A team working on a small project might be able to get away
      without using any requirements tools, instead using documents,
      spreadsheets, or simple databases to manage their requirements. Teams
      working on large projects will benefit from commercial requirements
      engineering tools. None of these tools replaces a defined process that
      your team members follow to develop and manage their requirements. Use a
      tool when you already have an approach that works but that requires
      greater efficiency. Don’t expect a tool to compensate for a lack of
      business analysis and requirements engineering process, training,
      discipline, or experience.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3387" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Avoid the temptation to develop your own requirements tools or
        to cobble together general-purpose automation products in an attempt
        to mimic the commercial requirements products. This initially looks
        like an easy solution, but it can quickly overwhelm a team that
        doesn’t have the resources to build the tools it really needs.</p></div><p class="calibre3">This chapter presents several benefits of using requirements tools
      and identifies some general capabilities you can expect to find in such
      products. Dozens of commercial requirements tools are available. This
      chapter doesn’t contain a feature-by-feature tool comparison, because
      the products are constantly evolving and their capabilities (and
      sometimes their vendors) change with each release. RD and RM tools often
      aren’t cheap, but the high cost of requirements-related problems can
      justify your investment in them. Recognize that the cost of a tool is
      not simply what you pay for the initial license. The cost also includes
      annual maintenance fees and periodic upgrades, software installation and
      configuration, administration, vendor support and consulting, and

        analysts to work with stakeholders to elicit and document requirements
        more effectively and more efficiently than with manual methods.
        Stakeholders will vary in how they best consume and share information:
        textually, visually, or audibly. RD tools can improve stakeholder
        collaboration by accommodating a variety of communication methods
        (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-491">[ref078]</a>). This section subdivides the development
        tools into elicitation, prototyping, and modeling tools. Some of the
        tools in the RD category provide all of these services. Some of them
        also offer requirements management capabilities. In general, RD tools
        are not as mature as RM tools, and their overall impact on projects is
        typically less than that of RM tools.</p><div class="book" title="Elicitation tools"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3389">Elicitation tools</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Elicitation tools include those used for recording notes
          during elicitation sessions. These enable the BA to quickly organize
          ideas and to annotate follow-up questions, action items, core terms,
          and the like. Mind-mapping tools facilitate brainstorming as well as
          organizing the information produced. Audio pens and other recording
          tools allow playback of conversations or provide visual reminders of
          what happened during an elicitation session. Some recording devices
          also tie the audio directly to the text that was written at the same
          time, enabling you to hear specific portions of the audio
          conversation as needed. Tools that support quality checks, such as
          scanning a requirements document for vague and ambiguous words, help
          a BA write clearer requirements. Some elicitation tools convert
          requirements from text to auto-generated diagrams. Certain tools
          also enable collaborative voting to help a team prioritize
          requirements.</p></div><div class="book" title="Prototyping tools"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3390">Prototyping tools</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Prototyping tools facilitate the creation of work products
          that range from electronic mock-ups to full application simulations.
          Simple prototyping tools come with basic shapes and designs to
          create low-fidelity wireframes (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-492">[ref080]</a>). Common
          applications such as Microsoft PowerPoint can be used to quickly
          mock up screens and the navigations between them or to annotate
          existing screen shots. Sophisticated tools might enable mocked-up
          functionality that a user can click through to see just how the
          application would work. Some prototyping tools support version
          control, feedback management, requirements linking, and code
          generation. See the cautions in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 15. Risk reduction through prototyping" href="#calibre_link-10">Chapter&nbsp;15</a> to avoid investing
          more effort in creating prototypes than is needed to achieve your
          goals. If you use a tool to create high-fidelity prototypes, make it
          clear to customers that the prototypes are just possible models and
          that the final product might be different. Some prototyping tools
          can show screen mock-ups in a “hand-drawn” style to help manage
          customer expectations.</p></div><div class="book" title="Modeling tools"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3391">Modeling tools</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-806" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-858" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1557" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2313" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2521" class="calibre"></a>Requirements modeling tools help the BA create
          diagrams like those described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 5. Establishing the business requirements" href="#calibre_link-32">Chapter&nbsp;5</a> <a class="xref" title="Chapter 12. A picture is worth 1024 words" href="#calibre_link-9">Chapter&nbsp;12</a> and <a class="xref" title="Chapter 13. Specifying data requirements" href="#calibre_link-87">Chapter&nbsp;13</a>. These tools support the
          use of standard shapes, notations, and syntax for drawing diagrams
          according to established conventions. They might provide templates
          as starting points and examples to help the BA learn more about each
          model. Often these tools automatically connect shapes in diagrams to
          accelerate the drawing process and to help ensure that the diagrams
          are drawn correctly. They also enable you to create diagrams that
          look cleaner and more consistent than if you draw them manually.
          Specialized software modeling tools facilitate iteration by dragging
          along connected arrows and labels whenever you move a symbol in the
          diagram; general-purpose drawing tools might not provide that
          capability.</p><p class="calibre3">Many requirements management tools also provide some modeling
          capability. The most sophisticated tools allow you to trace
          individual requirements to models or even to specific elements of
          models. For example, analysts can create swimlane diagrams in the
          tool, and then after they write requirements, they can trace those
          requirements back to specific steps in the diagrams.</p><p class="calibre3">Keep in mind that no tool will be able to tell you if a
          requirement or a model element is missing, logically incorrect, or
          unnecessary. These tools enable BAs to represent information in
          multiple ways and to spot certain types of errors and omissions, but
          they don’t eliminate the need for thinking and peer review.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Requirements management tools"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3392">Requirements management tools</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">An RM tool that stores information in a multiuser database
        provides a robust solution to the limitations of storing requirements
        in documents. Small project teams can get away with just entering the
        requirements text and several attributes of each requirement. Larger
        project teams will benefit from letting users import requirements from
        source documents, define attribute values, filter and display the
        database contents, export requirements in various formats, define
        traceability links, and connect requirements to items stored in other
        software development tools.</p><p class="calibre3">Requirements management tools have been available for many
        years. They are both more plentiful and more mature than requirements
        development tools. To be fair, the problem they solve is more
        tractable. It’s easier to create a database in which to store
        requirements and provide some capabilities to manipulate them than to
        help a BA discover new knowledge, craft that knowledge into precise
        requirement statements and diagrams, and ensure that the resulting
        information representations are correct. Some tools combine both RD
        and RM capabilities into a powerful solution aid.</p><div class="book" title="Benefits of using an RM tool"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3393">Benefits of using an RM tool</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Even if you do a magnificent job of eliciting and specifying
          your project’s requirements, you can lose control of them as
          development progresses. An RM tool becomes most valuable as time
          passes and the team members’ memories of the requirements details
          fade. The following sections describe some of the tasks such a tool
          can help you perform.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-632" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Manage versions and
          changes</strong></span> Your project should define one or more
          requirements baselines, each identifying a specific collection of
          requirements allocated to a particular release or iteration. Some RM
          tools provide baselining functions. The tools also maintain a
          history of the changes made to each requirement. You can record the
          rationale behind each change decision and revert to a previous
          version of a requirement if necessary. Some tools contain a
          change-proposal system that links change requests directly to the
          affected requirements.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Store requirements
          attributes</strong></span> You should record several descriptive
          attributes for each requirement, as discussed in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 27. Requirements management practices" href="#calibre_link-89">Chapter&nbsp;27</a>. Everyone working on
          the project must be able to view the attributes, and selected
          individuals will be permitted to update attribute values. RM tools
          generate several system-defined attributes, such as the date a
          requirement was created and its current version number, and they let
          you define additional attributes of various data types. Thoughtful
          definition of attributes allows stakeholders to select subsets of
          the requirements based on specific combinations of attribute values.
          A Release Number attribute is one way to keep track of the
          requirements allocated to various releases.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Facilitate impact analysis</strong></span>
          RM tools enable requirements tracing by letting you define links
          between different types of requirements, between requirements in
          different subsystems, and between individual requirements and
          related system components (for example, designs, code modules,
          tests, and user documentation). These links help you analyze the
          impact that a proposed change to a specific requirement will have on
          other system elements. It’s also a good idea to trace each
          functional requirement back to its origin or parent so that you know
          where it came from. For instance, you might ask to see a list of all
          the requirements originating from a specific business rule so that
          you can judge the consequences of a change in that rule. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 28. Change happens" href="#calibre_link-72">Chapter&nbsp;28</a> describes impact analysis, and <a class="xref" title="Chapter 29. Links in the requirements chain" href="#calibre_link-13">Chapter&nbsp;29</a> addresses requirements
          tracing.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Identify missing and extraneous
          requirements</strong></span> The tracing functionality in RM tools helps
          stakeholders identify requirements that are missing, such as user
          requirements that have no mapped functional requirements. Similarly,
          they can reveal requirements that cannot be traced back to a
          reasonable origin, raising the question of whether those
          requirements are necessary. If a business requirement is cut from
          scope, then all the requirements that trace from it can also be cut
          quickly.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Track requirements status</strong></span>
          Collecting requirements in a database lets you know how many
          discrete requirements you’ve specified for the product. As <a class="xref" title="Chapter 27. Requirements management practices" href="#calibre_link-89">Chapter&nbsp;27</a> described, tracking
          the status of each requirement during development supports the
          overall status tracking of the project.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Control access</strong></span> RM tools let
          you define access permissions for individuals or groups of users and
          share information with a geographically dispersed team through a web
          interface to the database. Some tools permit multiple users to
          update the database contents concurrently.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Communicate with
          stakeholders</strong></span> An RM tool serves as a master repository so
          that all stakeholders work from the same set of requirements. Some
          tools permit team members to discuss requirements issues
          electronically through threaded conversations. Automatically
          triggered email messages notify affected individuals when a new
          discussion entry is made or when a specific requirement is modified.
          This is a convenient method for visibly tracking decisions made
          about requirements. Making the requirements accessible online can
          minimize document proliferation and version confusion.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2010" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Reuse requirements</strong></span>
          Storing requirements in a database facilitates the reuse of them in
          multiple projects or subprojects. Requirements that logically fit
          into multiple parts of the product description can be stored once
          and referenced whenever necessary, to avoid duplicating
          requirements. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 18. Requirements reuse" href="#calibre_link-85">Chapter&nbsp;18</a> describes
          important concepts regarding effectively reusing
          requirements.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Track issue status</strong></span> Some RM
          tools have functionality for tracking open issues and linking each
          issue to its related requirements. As issues are resolved, it’s easy
          to determine whether any requirements must be updated. You can also
          quickly find a history of the issue and its resolution. Tracking
          issues in a tool enables automatic reporting on the status of the
          issues.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Generate tailored subsets</strong></span>
          RM tools allow you to extract and view a set of requirements that
          fits a particular purpose. For example, you might want a report that
          contains all of the requirements for a specific development
          iteration, all of the requirements that relate to a particular
          feature, or a set of requirements that needs to be inspected.</p></div><div class="book" title="RM tool capabilities"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3394">RM tool capabilities</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The feature tree in <a class="xref" title="Figure 30-1. Common RM tool features." href="#calibre_link-493">Figure&nbsp;30-1</a>
          presents a summary of the types of capabilities commonly found in RM
          tools. You can find detailed feature comparisons of many RM tools
          online (for example, see <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-494">[ref215]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-495">[ref120]</a>; <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-496">[ref234]</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-493" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3395" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000117.jpeg" alt="Common RM tool features." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;30-1.&nbsp;Common RM tool features.</div></div><p class="calibre3">RM tools let you define different requirement types, such as
          business requirements, use cases, functional requirements, hardware
          requirements, and constraints. This lets you differentiate all the
          types of information that are typically contained in an SRS. Many
          tools allow you to configure an information architecture (which
          defines how requirements types and other objects relate to one
          another) that is customized to your practices. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 29. Links in the requirements chain" href="#calibre_link-13">Chapter&nbsp;29</a> shows common
          traceability links that can be defined in the information
          architecture. Most of the tools provide strong capabilities for
          defining attributes for each requirement type, a great advantage
          over the typical document-based approach.</p><p class="calibre3">RM tools typically support hierarchical numeric requirement
          labels, in addition to maintaining a unique internal identifier for
          each requirement. These identifiers often consist of a short text
          prefix that indicates the requirement type&mdash;such as UR for a user
          requirement&mdash;followed by a unique integer. Some tools provide
          displays to let you manipulate the hierarchical requirements
          tree.</p><p class="calibre3">Requirements can be imported into an RM tool from various
          source document formats. The textual description of a requirement is
          treated simply as a required attribute. Several products let you
          incorporate nontextual objects such as graphics and spreadsheets
          into the requirements repository. Other products let you link
          individual requirements to external files (such as Microsoft Word
          files, graphics files, and so on) that provide supplementary
          information that augments the contents of the requirements
          repository.</p><p class="calibre3">Output capabilities from the tools generally include the
          ability to generate a requirements document in a variety of formats,
          including predefined or user-specified documents, spreadsheets, and
          webpages. Some tools allow significant customization for creating
          templates, allowing you to specify page layout, boilerplate text,
          attributes to extract from the database, and the text styles to use.
          Specification documents are then simply reports that are generated
          from the tool according to certain query criteria, formatted to look
          like a typical SRS. For example, you could create an SRS that
          contains all the functional requirements that are allocated to a
          specific release and assigned to a particular developer. Some tools
          provide functionality that lets users make changes in exported
          documents offline, which are then synchronized with the tool’s
          database when the user is back online.</p><p class="calibre3">Most tools enable different views of the requirements to be
          generated within the tool or exported from the tool. Features
          typically include the ability to set up user groups and define
          permissions for selected users or groups to create, read, update,
          and delete projects, requirements, attributes, and attribute values.
          Setting up appropriate views and permissions facilitates the review
          of requirements and collaboration to improve those requirements.
          Some tools also include learning aids, such as tutorials or sample
          projects, to help users get up to speed.</p><p class="calibre3">Requirements management tools generally have robust tracing
          features. Tracing is handled by defining links between two types of
          objects or objects of the same type. Some requirements management
          tools include modeling capabilities that also allow the models to be
          linked at an element level to individual requirements or to other
          model elements.</p><p class="calibre3">Some agile project management tools also provide RM
          capabilities. These tools are used to manage and prioritize
          backlogs, allocate requirements to iterations, and generate test
          cases directly from requirements.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1974" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2314" class="calibre"></a>RM tools often integrate with other tools used in
          application development, as illustrated in <a class="xref" title="Figure 30-2. RM tools integrate with other kinds of software tools." href="#calibre_link-497">Figure&nbsp;30-2</a>. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 29. Links in the requirements chain" href="#calibre_link-13">Chapter&nbsp;29</a> describes how
          individual requirements can be linked to objects that might reside
          in these other tools. For instance, you might be able to trace
          specific requirements to individual design elements stored in a
          design modeling tool, or to tests stored in a test management
          tool.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-497" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3396" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000118.jpeg" alt="An illustration showing Requirements Management Tool                 in a center oval with six ovals around it, connected by                 two-way arrows.

          Think about how you’ll take advantage of these product integrations
          as you perform your requirements engineering, testing, project
          tracking, and other processes. For example, consider how you would
          define trace links between functional requirements and specific
          design or code elements, and how you would verify that all tests
          linked back to specific functional requirements have been
          successfully executed.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Selecting and implementing a requirements tool"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3397">Selecting and implementing a requirements tool</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Any of these requirements tools can move your requirements

              input from current users, and your team’s subjective impressions
              of the products. Two good final questions to ask people who
              evaluate the tools are, “Which tool would you most want to use?”
              and, “Which tool would you be most upset about being forced to
              use?”</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="book" title="Setting up the tool and processes"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3399">Setting up the tool and processes</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Recognize that it will take effort to install a tool, load a
          project’s requirements into it, define attributes and trace links,
          keep the contents current, define access groups and their
          privileges, and adapt your processes to use the tool. Configuring
          the tool can be complex; there is a steep learning curve just to set
          up a sophisticated requirements tool. Management must allocate the
          resources needed for these operations. Make an organization-wide
          commitment to actually use the product you select, instead of
          letting it become expensive shelfware.</p><p class="calibre3">There’s little point in using a requirements tool if you don’t
          take advantage of its capabilities. I encountered one project team
          that had diligently stored all its requirements in an RM tool but
          hadn’t defined any requirement attributes or trace links. Nor did
          they provide online access for all the stakeholders. The fact that
          the requirements were stored in a different form didn’t provide
          significant benefits, although it consumed the effort needed to get
          the requirements into the tool. Another team stored hundreds of
          requirements in a high-end tool and defined many trace links. Their
          only use of the information was to generate massive printed
          traceability reports that were supposed to be reviewed manually for
          problems. No one actually examined the reports, and no one regarded
          the database as the authoritative repository of the project’s
          requirements. Neither of these organizations reaped the full
          benefits of their considerable investments of time and money in the
          tools.</p><p class="calibre3">Even if you select the best available tool, it won’t
          necessarily provide every capability that your organization wants or
          needs. It might not support your existing requirements templates or
          processes. You’ll still likely need to adapt some of your existing
          processes to incorporate the tool in them. Expect to have to make
          some changes to templates, attribute names, and the sequencing of
          requirements development activities. Consider the following
          suggestions to overcome process issues as you strive to maximize
          your return on investment from a requirements tool:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Assign an experienced BA to own the tool setup and process
              adaptations. She will understand the impact of configuration
              choices and process changes.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Think carefully about the various requirement types that
              you define. Don’t treat every section of your current SRS
              template as a separate requirement type, but don’t simply stuff
              all of the SRS contents into a single requirement type
              either.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Use the tool to facilitate communication with project
              stakeholders in various locations. Set the access and change
              privileges to permit sufficient input to the requirements by
              various people without giving everyone complete freedom to
              change everything in the database.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Don’t try to capture requirements directly in an RM tool
              during your early elicitation workshops. As the requirements
              begin to stabilize, though, storing them in the tool makes them
              visible to the workshop participants for refinement.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Use RD tools during elicitation activities only if you are
              confident that they will not slow down the discovery process and
              waste your stakeholders’ time.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Don’t define trace links until the requirements stabilize.
              Otherwise, you can count on doing a lot of work to revise the
              links as requirements continue to evolve.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">To accelerate the movement from a document-based paradigm
              to the use of the tool, set a date after which the tool’s
              database will be regarded as the definitive repository of the
              project’s requirements. After that date, requirements residing
              only in word-processing documents won’t be recognized as valid
              requirements.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Provided you remember that a tool can’t overcome process
          deficiencies, you’re likely to find that requirements tools greatly
          enhance the control you have over your software requirements.</p><div class="note" title="Important"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3400" class="calibre"></a>Important</h3><p class="calibre3">Don’t even pilot the use of an RM tool until your
            organization can create a reasonable software requirements
            specification on paper. If your biggest problems are with
            eliciting and writing clear, high-quality requirements, an RM tool
            won’t help you (although an RD tool might).</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Facilitating user adoption"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3401">Facilitating user adoption</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-917" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1606" class="calibre"></a>The diligence of the users of your requirements tools
          is a critical success factor. Dedicated, disciplined, and
          knowledgeable people will make progress even with mediocre tools,
          whereas the best tools won’t pay for themselves in the hands of
          unmotivated or ill-trained users. Don’t write a check for a tool
          unless you’re willing to respect the learning curve and make the
          time investment.</p><p class="calibre3">Buying a tool is easy; changing your culture and processes to
          accept the tool and take best advantage of it is much harder. Most
          organizations already are comfortable with taking elicitation notes
          in a word-processing document or by hand, and with storing their
          requirements in documents. Changing to use software-based tools
          requires a different way of thinking. Using RD tools requires
          breaking old habits for running elicitation sessions. An RM tool
          makes the requirements visible to any stakeholder who has access to
          the database. Some stakeholders interpret this visibility as
          reducing the control they have over the requirements, the
          requirements engineering process, or both. Some people prefer not to
          share an incomplete or imperfect set of requirements with the world,
          yet the database contents are there for all to see. Keeping the
          requirements private until they’re “done” means you miss an
          opportunity to have other pairs of eyes scan the requirements
          frequently for possible problems.</p><p class="calibre3">People are often resistant to change things that they’re
          familiar with, and they usually have a comfort level with working on
          requirements in documents. They might have a perception&mdash;even if
          incorrect&mdash;that using a requirements tool will be harder for them.
          Also, don’t forget that most of the tool users are already busy.
          Time must be allocated to let them get used to using the tool in
          their daily jobs. Eventually, the tool probably won’t actually
          require more time from users, but they first need to get over the
          learning curve and develop new work habits using the tool. Following
          are some suggestions to help you deal with issues regarding user
          adoption and culture change:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Identify a tool advocate, a local enthusiast who learns
              the tool’s ins and outs, mentors other users, and sees that it
              gets employed as intended. This person should be an experienced
              business analyst who can be the single owner for ensuring tool
              adoption. This initial tool advocate will work with other users
              on their projects to ingrain the tool into their daily
              activities. Then he’ll train and mentor others to support the
              tool as other projects adopt it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">One of the biggest adoption challenges to overcome is that
              users don’t believe the tool will actually add any value.
              Perhaps they haven’t recognized the pain from limitations of
              their existing manual approaches. Share stories with them about
              where the lack of a tool caused a negative impact and ask them
              to think of their own examples.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Your team members are smart, but it’s better to train them
              than to expect them to figure out how best to use the tool on
              their own. They can undoubtedly deduce the basic operations, but
              they won’t learn about the full set of tool capabilities and how
              to exploit them efficiently.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Because you can’t expect instantaneous results, don’t base
              a project’s success on a tool you’re using for the first time.
              Begin with a pilot application of the tool on a noncritical
              project. This will help the organization learn how much effort
              it takes to administer and support the tool. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 31. Improving your requirements processes" href="#calibre_link-15">Chapter&nbsp;31</a> describes the
              learning curve associated with adopting new tools and
              techniques.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">The proliferation and increased usage of tools to assist with
          requirements development and management represents a significant
          trend in software engineering that will undoubtedly continue. Too
          many organizations, though, fail to reap the benefits of their
          investment in such tools. They do not adequately consider their
          organization’s culture and processes and the effort needed to shift
          from a document-based requirements paradigm to a tool-based
          approach. The guidance in this chapter will help you choose
          appropriate tools and use them effectively. Just remember, a tool
          cannot replace a solid requirements process or team members with
          suitable skills and knowledge. A fool with a tool is an amplified
          fool.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3402" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Next steps</div><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Analyze shortcomings in your current requirements

      not gone smoothly. As the lead business analyst, Joanne knew that
      requirements issues had caused at least some of the problems. The BAs on
      the various projects varied greatly in their education and experience
      levels. They each used different approaches for developing and managing
      requirements, just doing the best they could based on what they knew.
      They each organized their requirements in different ways. Some teams
      followed effective requirements change processes, which reduced the
      turmoil in their projects, whereas others reacted to every change
      request that came along in a knee-jerk fashion. The frustration level
      was high all around.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Joanne had tried mentoring her less experienced BAs;
      some were more receptive to her input than others. Some of the teams in
      Joanne’s organization did do a good job on their requirements, and those
      projects suffered fewer headaches than those of the other teams. Joanne
      realized that it would be great to bring all of the teams up to a higher
      level of requirements performance. Maybe now the time was right to get
      serious about improving their requirements practices. But would the
      other BAs and their fellow team members play along? Was management truly
      committed to reducing the pain points? Would anything really change this
      time, or would this improvement initiative founder on the rocks of
      indifference, as the earlier ones had?</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">Previous chapters have described several dozen requirements
      engineering “good practices” to consider applying in your organization.
      Putting better practices into action is the essence of software process
      improvement. In a nutshell, process improvement consists of using more
      of the approaches that work well for you and avoiding those that have
      given you headaches in the past. However, the path to improved
      performance is paved with false starts, resistance from those who are
      affected, and the challenge of having too little time to handle
      improvement activities in addition to current tasks.</p><p class="calibre3">The ultimate objective of process improvement is to reduce the
      cost of creating and maintaining software, thereby increasing the value
      delivered by projects. Ways to accomplish this include:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Correcting problems encountered on previous projects that

      see the need to change their approach. However, even successful software
      organizations can struggle when confronted with larger or more complex
      projects than they are used to, different customers, long-distance
      collaborations, tighter schedules, or new business domains. Approaches
      that worked for a team of 5 people with a single customer don’t scale up
      to 100 people located in 3 time zones who are serving 50 corporate

        Requirements serve as the foundation of the project planning process.
        The planners select an appropriate software development life cycle and
        create resource and schedule estimates based on the requirements.
        Project planning might indicate that it’s not possible to deliver the
        entire desired feature set within the available bounds of resources
        and time. The planning process can lead to reductions in the project
        scope or to the selection of an incremental or staged-release approach
        to deliver functionality in phases. On an agile project, scope is
        defined through the set of user stories in the product or release
        backlog and is incrementally implemented in each iteration. The scope
        planned for future iterations is based on the velocity measurements
        from earlier iterations.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Project tracking and control</strong></span>
        Project tracking includes monitoring the project’s status so the
        project manager can see whether construction and verification are
        proceeding as intended. If they are not, management, customers, or
        other stakeholders might need to request scope modification through
        the planning process. This would change the requirements set being
        worked on. On an agile project, scope is adjusted by moving
        lower-priority items to future iterations if necessary to complete
        each iteration on schedule.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Change control</strong></span> After a set of
        requirements has been baselined, all subsequent changes and additions
        should be made through a defined change control process. Requirements
        changes modify the backlog of remaining work to be done and the
        priorities of the work items in the backlog. Requirements tracing
        helps you assess the impact of scope changes. As described in <a class="xref" title="Chapter 28. Change happens" href="#calibre_link-72">Chapter&nbsp;28</a> the change control process helps ensure
        that the right people make informed and well-communicated decisions to
        accept appropriate requirements changes.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Acceptance and system testing</strong></span>
        User requirements and functional requirements are essential inputs to
        acceptance testing and system testing, respectively. If the expected
        behavior of the software under various conditions isn’t clearly
        specified, the testers will be hard-pressed to verify that all planned
        functionality has been implemented as intended. A colleague related
        her recent experience: “I was assigned to write a test plan for an SRS
        from another analyst. I ended up going way over the estimated time
        because I had to wade around to figure out what the functionality was.
        The related functionality was sometimes in unexpected sections of the
        SRS. Other times, the analyst who wrote the SRS talked us through the
        full description of options that were <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">not</em></span> chosen
        before finally getting to the one that was. It was painful.”</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Construction</strong></span> Requirements are
        the basis for the design and implementation work, and they tie
        together the various construction work products. Use design reviews to
        ensure that the designs correctly address all of the requirements.
        Unit testing can determine whether the code satisfies the design
        specifications and the pertinent requirements. Requirements tracing
        lets you identify the software design and code elements that were
        derived from each requirement.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">User documentation</strong></span> I once
        worked in an office area that also housed the technical writers who
        prepared user documentation for complex software products. I asked one
        of the writers why they worked such long hours. “We’re at the end of
        the food chain,” she replied. “We have to respond to the final changes
        in user interface displays and the features that got dropped or added
        at the last minute.” The product’s requirements provide input to the
        user documentation, so poorly written or late-breaking requirements
        lead to documentation problems. It’s not surprising that the people at
        the end of the requirements chain, such as technical writers and
        testers, are often enthusiastic supporters of improved requirements
        engineering practices and of being engaged earlier in the
        process.</p></div><div class="book" title="Requirements and various stakeholder groups"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3408">Requirements and various stakeholder groups</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-3409" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2188" class="calibre"></a><a class="xref" title="Figure 31-1. Relationship of requirements to other project processes." href="#calibre_link-500">Figure&nbsp;31-1</a> shows some of

        and participation you need from them if the product development effort
        is to succeed. Agree on the communication interfaces between the
        development group and other functional areas, such as a system

        processes, the interactions it has with other stakeholder communities
        change as well. People don’t like to be forced out of their comfort
        zone, so expect some resistance to the process changes you propose.
        Understand the origins of the resistance so you can both respect it
        and defuse it.</p><p class="calibre3">Much resistance comes from fear of the unknown. To reduce this
        fear, communicate your process improvement rationale. Explain the
        benefits that the other groups will receive from the new process.
        Begin from this viewpoint: “Here are the problems we’ve all
        experienced. What are the issues from your perspective? Can we put our
        heads together to figure out a better way to do things here?” Engaging
        other stakeholders in the improvement initiative leads to shared
        ownership of the solutions.</p><p class="calibre3">Following are some forms of resistance that you might
        encounter:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">People who are already too busy to get their project work
            done don’t think they have time to invest in adopting better
            practices. But if you don’t invest that time, there’s no reason to
            expect the next project to go more smoothly than the last
            one.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">A change control process might be viewed as a barrier thrown
            up by development to make it harder to get changes made. In
            reality, it is a structure, not a barrier. It permits
            well-informed people to make good business decisions and to
            communicate those decisions. The software team must ensure that
            the requirements change process really does work. If new processes
            don’t yield better results, people will naturally find ways to
            work around them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Some developers and managers view writing and reviewing
            requirements as bureaucratic time-wasters that delay the “real
            work” of coding. If you can explain the high cost of continually
            rewriting the code while the team tries to figure out what the
            system should do, developers and managers will better appreciate
            the need for good requirements. Overlooked requirements can reduce
            profitability during the operational lifetime of a software
            product, because effort must continually be invested in producing
            upgrades.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">Any time people are asked to change the way they work, the
        natural reaction is to ask, “What’s in it for me?” However, process
        changes don’t always result in fabulous, immediate benefits for each
        person involved. A better question&mdash;and one that deserves a good
        answer&mdash;is “What’s in it for <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">us</em></span>?” Every process
        change should offer clear benefits to the project team, the
        development organization, the company, and/or the customer.
        Stakeholders who are asked to spend more time helping to create better
        requirements just see this as more work for them to do today. But
        suppose they understand that this investment on their part can pay off
        significantly with reduced rework later in the project, reduced
        support costs, and increased value for the customers. This
        understanding might make them more willing to spend the time
        now.</p><p class="calibre3">It’s common for some project stakeholders to be unaware of the
        requirement-related impacts from the organization’s current ways of
        working. Therefore, an important method for gaining commitment to
        process change is to make the problems visible in a nonjudgmental and
        constructive fashion. Suppose the development team builds an
        application that requires considerable customer support because of
        user interface problems. If a support team separate from development
        has to deal with those issues, the development team might not even be
        aware of the problems. Or suppose management has outsourced
        development in an attempt to save costs or time, but has not dealt
        with the resulting communication barriers and cultural differences. If
        management is not aware of these consequences, they won’t have any
        reason to change their approach to correct the shortcomings.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-916" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1605" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1984" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1986" class="calibre"></a>We’ve often heard business analysts and other
        practitioners say that they can’t make some process change in their
        organization without “management support.” Too often, management
        support translates merely into permission to do something different.
        But as an intelligent professional, you don’t need management’s
        permission to work in the best way you know how: that’s your job.
        However, you definitely do need management
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">commitment</em></span> for a project-wide or
        organization-wide improvement effort to be sustained and successful.
        Without management commitment, only those practitioners who think that
        better requirements are important will get on board. It doesn’t help
        if your senior people say they “support” the improvements but then
        revert to the same old processes as soon as problems arise.
        Behaviors&mdash;not pronouncements&mdash;constitute evidence of commitment to

          currently being used to identify their strengths and shortcomings.
          The assessment lays the foundation for selecting the changes you
          should make. It also brings visibility to the processes actually
          being used in the organization, which are frequently different from
          the stated or documented processes. And you’ll find that different
          team members often have rather different perspectives as to what
          processes the team is actually using.</p><p class="calibre3">You can evaluate your current requirements processes in
          several ways. If you tried any of the “Next steps” at the end of
          previous chapters, you’ve already begun an informal evaluation of
          your requirements practices and their results. <a class="xref" title="Appendix C. Requirements troubleshooting guide" href="#calibre_link-62">Appendix&nbsp;C</a> offers dozens of
          symptoms of common requirements problems, along with possible root
          causes and possible solutions. Structured questionnaires can reveal
          insights about your current processes at a low cost. Interviews and
          discussions with team members provide a more accurate and
          comprehensive understanding than questionnaires reveal. Formal
          evaluations by outside consultants produce a list of
          findings&mdash;statements of both strengths and weaknesses in the current
          processes&mdash;and recommendations for addressing the improvement
          opportunities.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-549" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1701" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1981" class="calibre"></a>For a simple do-it-yourself approach, use the
          questionnaire in <a class="xref" title="Appendix B. Current requirements practice self-assessment" href="#calibre_link-17">Appendix&nbsp;B</a> to calibrate
          your organization’s current requirements engineering practices. This
          self-assessment helps you decide which of your requirements
          processes are most in need of improvement. Just because you give
          yourself a low rating on a particular question isn’t reason enough
          to address it immediately or perhaps at all. Focus your energy on
          improving those practice areas that cause your projects the most
          difficulties and those that pose risks to the success of your future
          projects.</p></div><div class="book" title="Plan improvement actions"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3422">Plan improvement actions</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">In keeping with the philosophy of treating process improvement
          activities as projects, write an action plan following your
          current-practices assessment (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-502">[ref192]</a>). Tactical
          action plans target specific improvement areas, such as the ways you
          elicit or prioritize requirements. Each action plan should identify
          measurable improvement goals, the participants, and the individual
          action items that must be completed to implement the plan. Without a
          plan, it’s easy to overlook important tasks. The plan also lets you
          monitor progress as you track the completion of individual action
          items.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 31-6. Action plan template for software process improvement." href="#calibre_link-505">Figure&nbsp;31-6</a>

          many times. Include no more than about 10 items in each action plan,
          scoped such that the plan can be completed in 2 or 3 months. As an
          example, I saw a plan for requirements management improvements that
          included these action items:</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-505" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3423" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000124.gif" alt="A template for a process improvement action plan,                 containing the following major sections: goals; measures of                 success; scope of organizational impact; staffing and                 participants; tracking and reporting process; dependencies                 risks, and barriers; estimated completion date; and action                 items.

          do.</p><p class="calibre3">If you need more than about 10 action items, focus the initial
          activity cycle on the most important issues and address the rest
          later in a separate action plan. Remember, process change is
          incremental and ongoing. The process improvement road map described
          later in this chapter illustrates how you can group multiple
          improvement actions into an overall software process improvement
          plan.</p></div><div class="book" title="Create, pilot, and roll out processes"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3424">Create, pilot, and roll out processes</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1658" class="calibre"></a>So far, you’ve evaluated your current requirements
          practices and crafted a plan for addressing the areas you think are
          most likely to yield benefits. Now comes the hard part: implementing
          the plan.</p><p class="calibre3">Implementing an action plan means developing processes that
          you believe will yield better results than your current ways of
          working do. Don’t expect to get the new processes perfect on the
          first try. Many approaches that seem like a good idea in the
          abstract turn out to be less pragmatic or less effective than
          anticipated. Therefore, pilot most of the new procedures or
          templates you create on a small scale before implementing them for
          real. Use the knowledge gained from the pilot to adjust the new
          process. This improves the chance that it will be effective and well
          received when you roll it out to the affected community. Keep the
          following suggestions in mind for your process pilots:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1164" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1450" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1985" class="calibre"></a>Select pilot participants who will give the new
              approaches a fair try and provide helpful feedback. These
              participants could be either allies or skeptics, but they
              shouldn’t strongly oppose the improvement effort.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Quantify the criteria the team will use to evaluate the
              pilot’s results.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Identify the stakeholders who need to be informed about
              the pilot and why it is being performed.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Consider piloting portions of the new processes on
              different projects. This engages more people in trying new
              approaches, which increases awareness, feedback, and
              buy-in.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">As part of the evaluation, ask pilot participants how they
              would feel if they had to go back to their former ways of
              working.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">If the pilot was successful, you’re ready to make any final
          adjustments to the process and roll it out to the affected community
          for implementation. Even motivated and receptive teams have a
          limited capacity to absorb change, so don’t place too many new
          expectations on a project team at once. Craft a roll-out plan that
          defines how you’ll distribute the new methods and materials to the
          project teams, and provide sufficient training, coaching, and
          assistance. Also consider how management will set and communicate
          their expectations about the new processes.</p></div><div class="book" title="Evaluate results"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3425">Evaluate results</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The final step of a process improvement cycle is to evaluate
          the activities performed and the results achieved. This evaluation
          will help the team do an even better job on future improvement
          activities. Assess how smoothly the pilots ran. How effective were
          they in resolving the uncertainties about the new processes? Would
          you change anything the next time you conduct a process
          pilot?</p><p class="calibre3">Consider how well the rollout of the new processes went. Was
          the availability of the new processes or templates communicated to
          everyone affected? Did participants understand and successfully
          apply the new processes? Would you change anything about how you
          handle the next rollout?</p><p class="calibre3">A critical step is to assess whether the new processes are
          yielding the desired results. Some new practices deliver visible
          improvements quickly, but others take time to demonstrate their full
          value. For example, you should be able to tell quickly whether a new
          requirements change control process is effective. However, a new
          document template can take some time to prove its worth as business
          analysts and other stakeholders get used to it. Give new approaches
          adequate time to work, and select measures early on that will
          demonstrate the success of each change.</p><p class="calibre3">Accept the reality of the learning curve, the productivity
          drop that takes place as practitioners take time to assimilate new
          ways of working, as illustrated in <a class="xref" title="Figure 31-7. The learning curve, an unavoidable aspect of process improvement." href="#calibre_link-506">Figure&nbsp;31-7</a>. This
          short-term productivity drop&mdash;sometimes called the “valley of
          despair”&mdash;is part of the investment your organization is making in
          process improvement. People who don’t understand this might be
          tempted to abandon the improvement effort before it begins to pay
          off, thereby achieving a zero&mdash;or worse&mdash;return on their investment.
          Educate your managers and peers about the learning curve, and commit
          to seeing the change initiative through.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-506" class="calibre"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-3426" class="calibre"></a><img src="images/000125.jpeg" alt="A stylized graph of performance versus time.

        have a goal. If you don’t define specific improvement goals, people
        might not work in alignment, you can’t tell whether you’re making
        progress, you can’t prioritize improvement efforts, and you can’t tell
        if you’ve reached your destination. <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Metrics</em></span> are
        quantifiable aspects of a software project, product, or process.
        <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Key performance indicators</em></span>, or KPIs, are metrics
        that are tied to a target and reveal your progress toward achieving a
        specific goal or outcome. A set of KPIs can be displayed in a
        measurement dashboard that shows how you are approaching meeting your
        goals.</p><p class="calibre3">Keep two considerations in mind when setting process improvement
        goals. First, remember that process improvement for its own sake is
        meaningless. Therefore, ask yourself whether achieving that goal would
        in fact deliver the business value improvements that you seek. Second,
        you don’t want the team members to get frustrated trying to reach a
        target they cannot realistically attain, so ask yourself whether the
        goal is achievable in your environment. The answer to both questions
        must be “yes” for an improvement goal to be appropriate.</p><p class="calibre3">Numerous aspects of requirements work on a project can be
        measured, including product size, requirements quality, requirements
        status, change activity, and the effort devoted to requirements
        engineering and management (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">[ref247]</a>). In addition,
        measurements of whether the project achieved its business objectives
        will reflect whether the requirements activities were on target. For
        process improvement activities, though, you need to select measurement
        targets that will tell you whether your improvement investments are
        paying off in the ways you hope they will. We mentioned earlier in
        this chapter that process improvement should be goal-oriented, and
        that a great motivator for process change is pain the organization has
        experienced on previous projects. So select your KPIs by defining
        quantitative improvement goals and then determining how you could
        judge whether the pain that led you to choose those goals is
        lessening.</p><p class="calibre3">Note that you can’t measure quantitative progress unless you’ve
        established a baseline, a reference starting point of how things are
        working for you today. Ideally, you would measure the current value of
        some indicator, then set a desired target value you’d like to reach
        after a certain period of time, and direct your process improvement
        activities toward achieving that outcome. In reality, many software
        organizations lack a measurement culture, so they will have difficulty
        establishing such a quantitative baseline. Nonetheless, it’s hard to
        tell how close you’re getting to your objective if you have neither a
        starting point nor a yardstick.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-2033" class="calibre"></a><a class="xref" title="Table 31-2. Possible key performance indicators for certain requirements process improvement goals" href="#calibre_link-511">Table&nbsp;31-2</a> lists several

        each goal, the table suggests possible indicators that would tell
        whether the changes you’re making are paying off as intended. Most
        measurements of software are lagging indicators. It takes a while for
        new approaches to demonstrate sustained benefits, so give the new ways
        of working a chance to take hold and begin to yield benefits.</p><div class="table"><a id="calibre_link-511" class="calibre"></a><div class="table-title">Table&nbsp;31-2.&nbsp;Possible key performance indicators for certain requirements

        thinking backward to figure out what metrics would be valuable. First,
        state the improvement goals. For each goal, think of questions you
        would have to answer to judge whether the team is reaching that goal.
        Finally, identify metrics that will provide an answer for each
        question. These metrics, or combinations of them, will serve as your

        sustainable success. Rather than just diving in, consider developing a
        road map for implementing improved requirements practices in your
        organization. If you tried any of the requirements process assessment
        approaches described in this chapter, you have some ideas about the
        practices and process assets that would be most helpful to your
        organization. The process improvement road map sequences improvement
        actions to yield the greatest and quickest benefits with the smallest
        investment.</p><p class="calibre3">Because every situation is different, there is no
        one-size-fits-all road map. Formulaic approaches to process
        improvement don’t replace careful thinking, good judgment, and common
        sense. <a class="xref" title="Figure 31-9. Sample requirements process improvement road map." href="#calibre_link-513">Figure&nbsp;31-9</a>

        Implement each threaded set of improvement activities from left to

        milestone to an individual, who can then write an action plan for

      Tracking System at Contoso Pharmaceuticals, is meeting with his lead
      programmer, Helen, and the lead tester, Ramesh. All are excited about
      the new project, but they remember the problems they ran into on an
      earlier project called the Pharm Simulator.</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“Remember how we didn’t find out that the users hated
      the Simulator’s user interface until beta testing?” Helen asked. “It
      took us four weeks to rebuild it and retest it. I sure don’t want to go
      through that death march again.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“That was awful,” Dave agreed. “It was also annoying
      that the users we talked to swore they needed a lot of features that no
      one has used so far. That drug interaction modeling feature took three
      times longer to code than we expected, and we wound up throwing it out.
      What a waste!”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Ramesh had a suggestion. “Maybe we should list these
      problems from the Simulator so we can try to avoid them on the Chemical
      Tracking System. I read an article on software risk management that said
      we should identify risks up front and figure out how to prevent them
      from hurting the project.”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">“I don’t know about that,” Dave protested. “We probably
      won’t have those same problems again. If we write down things that could
      go wrong on the Chemical Tracking System, it’ll look like I don’t know
      how to run a software project. I don’t want any negative thinkers on
      this project. We have to plan for success!”</em></span></p><p class="calibre3">As Dave’s final comment suggests, software engineers and project
      managers are eternal optimists. We often expect our next project to run
      smoothly, despite the history of problems on earlier projects. The
      reality is that dozens of potential pitfalls can delay or derail a
      software project. Contrary to Dave’s beliefs, software teams
      <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">must</em></span> identify and control their project risks,
      beginning with those related to requirements.</p><p class="calibre3">A <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">risk</em></span> is a condition that could cause some
      loss or otherwise threaten the success of a project. This condition
      hasn’t actually caused a problem yet&mdash;and you’d like to keep it that way.
      These potential problems might have an adverse impact on the project’s
      cost, schedule, or technical success; the product’s quality; or the
      team’s effectiveness. <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">Risk management</em></span> is the
      process of identifying, evaluating, and controlling risks before they
      harm your project. If something untoward has already happened on the
      project, it’s an issue, not a risk. Deal with current problems and
      issues through your project’s ongoing status tracking and corrective
      action processes.</p><p class="calibre3">Because no one can predict the future with certainty, risk
      management is used to minimize the likelihood or impact of potential
      problems. Risk management means dealing with a concern before it becomes
      a crisis. This improves the chance of project success and reduces the
      financial or other consequences of those risks that you can’t avoid.
      Risks that lie outside the team’s sphere of control should be directed
      to the appropriate level of management for attention.</p><p class="calibre3">Because requirements play such a central role in software
      projects, the prudent project manager will identify requirements-related
      risks early and control them aggressively. Typical requirements risks
      include misunderstanding the requirements, inadequate user involvement,
      uncertain or changing project scope and objectives, and continually
      changing requirements. Project managers can control requirements risks
      only through collaboration with customers and other stakeholders.
      Jointly documenting requirements risks and planning mitigation actions
      reinforces the customer-development partnership that was discussed in
      <a class="xref" title="Chapter 2. Requirements from the customer’s perspective" href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>.</p><p class="calibre3">Simply knowing about the risks doesn’t make them go away, so this
      chapter presents a brief tutorial on software risk management (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-57">[ref248]</a>). Later in the chapter, we also describe a number of
      risk factors that can raise their ugly heads during requirements
      engineering activities. Use this information to launch an attack on your
      requirements risks before they attack your project.</p><div class="book" title="Fundamentals of software risk management"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3436">Fundamentals of software risk management</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Projects face many kinds of risks besides those related to
        requirements. Dependence on an external entity, such as a
        subcontractor or another project that is providing components to be
        reused, is a common source of risk. Project management is fraught with
        risks from poor estimation, rejection of accurate estimates by
        managers, insufficient visibility into project status, and staff
        turnover. Technology risks threaten highly complex and leading-edge
        development projects. Lack of knowledge is another source of risk,
        such as with practitioners who have insufficient experience with the
        technologies being used or with the application domain. Transitioning
        to a new development method introduces a raft of new risks. And
        ever-changing, imposed government regulations can disrupt the
        best-laid project plans.</p><p class="calibre3">Scary! This is why all projects need to take risk management
        seriously. Risk management involves scanning the horizon for icebergs,
        rather than steaming full speed ahead with great confidence that your
        ship is unsinkable. As with other processes, scale your risk
        management activities to your project’s size. Small projects can get
        by with a simple risk list, but formal risk management planning is a
        key element of a successful large-scale project.</p><div class="book" title="Elements of risk management"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3437">Elements of risk management</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Risk management involves the application of tools and

          undertaking certain projects, by relying on proven rather than
          cutting-edge technologies and development methods, or by excluding
          features that will be especially difficult to implement. Software
          development is intrinsically risky, though, so avoiding risk might

          you document risk statements. That is, state the risk condition that
          you are concerned about, followed by the potential adverse
          outcome&mdash;the consequence&mdash;from that condition. Often, people who
          suggest risks state only the condition (“the customers don’t agree
          on the product requirements”) or the consequence (“we can satisfy
          only one of our major customers”). Pull these statements together
          into the condition-consequence structure: “If the customers don’t
          agree on the product requirements, then we might be able to satisfy
          only one of our major customers.” One condition might lead to
          several consequences, and several conditions can result in the same
          consequence.</p><p class="calibre3">The template provides spaces to record the probability of a
          risk materializing into a problem, the negative impact on the
          project as a result of that problem, and the overall risk exposure.
          I like to estimate the probability on a scale from 0.1 (highly
          unlikely) to 1.0 (certain to happen), and the impact on a relative
          scale of 1 (no problem) to 10 (big trouble). Even better, try to
          rate the potential impact in units of lost time or money. Multiply
          the probability by the impact to estimate the exposure from each
          risk.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1499" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2048" class="calibre"></a>Don’t try to quantify risks too precisely. Your goal
          is to differentiate the most threatening risks from those you don’t
          need to tackle immediately. You might find it easier simply to
          estimate both probability and impact as high, medium, or low. Those
          items that have at least one <span class="calibre"><em class="calibre4">high</em></span> rating demand
          your early attention.</p><p class="calibre3">Use the Risk Management Plan field to identify the actions you
          intend to take to control the risk. Some mitigation strategies work
          to reduce the risk probability, others to reduce the impact.
          Consider the cost of mitigation when planning. It doesn’t make sense
          to spend $20,000 to control a risk with a maximum estimated impact
          of only $10,000 if it materialized into a problem. You might also
          devise contingency plans for the most severe risks to anticipate
          what actions to take if, despite your efforts, the risk does affect
          your project. Assign every risk that you plan to control to an
          individual owner, and set a target date for completing the
          mitigation actions. Long-term or complex risks might require a
          multistep mitigation strategy.</p><p class="calibre3"><a class="xref" title="Figure 32-3. Sample risk item from the Chemical Tracking System." href="#calibre_link-520">Figure&nbsp;32-3</a>

          Until they evaluate other risks, they won’t know how serious a risk
          exposure of 4.2 is&mdash;risk exposures are relative. The first two
          mitigation approaches reduce the probability of this risk becoming a
          problem by increasing user involvement in the requirements process.

          For a small project, you can include your plans for controlling
          risks in the software project management plan. A large project
          should write a separate risk management plan that spells out the
          approaches it intends to take to identify, evaluate, document, and
          track risks. This plan should include the roles and responsibilities
          for the risk management activities. A risk management plan template
          is available with this book’s companion content. Many projects
          appoint a project risk manager to be responsible for staying on top
          of the things that could go wrong. One company dubbed their risk
          manager “Eeyore,” after the gloomy Winnie-the-Pooh character who
          constantly bemoaned how bad things could become.</p><div class="note" title="Trap"><h3 class="title4"><a id="calibre_link-3443" class="calibre"></a>Trap</h3><p class="calibre3">Don’t assume that risks are under control just because you
            identified them and selected mitigation actions. Follow through on
            the risk management actions. Include enough time for risk
            management in the project schedule so that you don’t waste your
            investment in risk planning. Include risk mitigation activities,
            risk status reporting, and updating the risk list in your
            project’s task list.</p></div><p class="calibre3">Establish a rhythm of periodic risk monitoring. Keep the 10 or
          so risks that have the highest risk exposure visible, and track the
          effectiveness of your mitigation approaches regularly. When a
          mitigation action is completed, reevaluate the probability and
          impact for that risk item and then update the risk list and any
          other pending mitigation plans accordingly. A risk is not
          necessarily under control simply because the mitigation actions have
          been completed. You need to judge whether your mitigation approaches
          have reduced the exposure to an acceptable level or whether the
          opportunity for a specific risk to become a problem has
          passed.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-3444" class="calibre"></a><div class="sidebar-title">Out of control</div><p class="calibre3">A project manager once asked me what to do if the same items
            remained on his top-five risk list week after week. This suggests
            that the mitigation actions for those risks aren’t being
            implemented, that they aren’t effective, or that there’s no way
            for the team to control those risks. If your mitigation actions
            are effective, the exposure from risks that you are attempting to
            control will decrease. This lets other risks that were less
            threatening than the initial top five float up to the top of the
            risk list and engage your attention. Periodically reassess the
            probability of each risk materializing, and the potential loss if
            it does, to see whether your risk mitigation activities are
            getting the job done.</p></div></div></div><div class="book" title="Requirements-related risks"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-517">Requirements-related risks</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">The risk factors described on the following pages are organized

          requirements elicitation efforts. Following are several areas of
          potential elicitation risk and suggestions for how to avoid
          them.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Product vision and project
          scope</strong></span> Scope creep is more likely if the stakeholders lack
          a shared understanding of what the product is supposed to be (and
          not be) and do. Early in the project, write a vision and scope
          document that contains your business requirements, and use it to
          guide decisions about new or modified requirements.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Time spent on requirements
          development</strong></span> Tight project schedules often pressure
          managers and customers into glossing over the requirements because
          they believe that if the developers don’t start coding immediately,
          they won’t finish on time. Record how much effort you actually spend
          on requirements development for each project so that you can judge
          whether it was sufficient and improve your planning for future
          projects. Agile development approaches allow construction to begin
          earlier than on projects following a waterfall life cycle.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Customer engagement</strong></span>
          Insufficient customer involvement during the project increases the
          chance of an expectation gap. Identify stakeholders, customers, and
          user classes early in the project. Determine who will serve as the
          literal voice of the user for each user class. Engage key
          stakeholders as product champions. Make sure product champions
          fulfill their commitments so you elicit the correct needs.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Completeness and correctness of
          requirements specifications</strong></span> Elicit user requirements that
          map to business requirements to ensure that the solution will
          deliver what the customers really need. Devise usage scenarios,
          write tests from the requirements, and have customers define their
          acceptance criteria. Create prototypes to make the requirements more
          meaningful for users and to elicit specific feedback from them.
          Enlist customer representatives to review the requirements and
          analysis models.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Requirements for innovative
          products</strong></span> It’s easy to misgauge market response to
          products that are the first of their kind. Emphasize market
          research, build prototypes, and use focus groups to obtain early and
          frequent customer feedback about your innovative product
          visions.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Defining nonfunctional
          requirements</strong></span> Because of the natural emphasis on product
          functionality, it’s easy to neglect nonfunctional requirements.
          Query customers about quality characteristics such as performance,
          usability, security, and reliability. Document these nonfunctional
          requirements and their acceptance criteria as precisely as you
          can.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Customer agreement on
          requirements</strong></span> If the diverse customers for your system
          don’t agree on what you should build, someone will be unhappy with
          the result. Determine who the primary customers are, and use the
          product champion approach to get adequate customer representation
          and involvement. Make sure you’re relying on the right people for
          making decisions about requirements. Have appropriate stakeholder
          representatives review the requirements.</p><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-614" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1245" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1687" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-3446" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-1932" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2040" class="calibre"></a><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Unstated
          requirements</strong></span> Customers often hold implicit expectations
          that are neither communicated nor documented. Try to identify any
          assumptions the customers might be making. Use open-ended questions
          to encourage customers to share more of their thoughts, wishes,
          ideas, information, and concerns than you might otherwise hear.
          Asking customers what would make them reject the product might
          reveal some topics that have not yet been explored.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Existing product used as the
          requirements reference</strong></span> Requirements development might not
          be deemed important on next-generation or replacement projects.
          Developers are sometimes told to use the existing product as their
          source for requirements, with a list of changes and additions. <a class="xref" title="Chapter 21. Enhancement and replacement projects" href="#calibre_link-18">Chapter&nbsp;21</a> suggested some
          ways to reverse-engineer requirements from an existing
          application.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Solutions presented as
          needs</strong></span> User-proposed solutions can mask the users’ actual
          needs, lead to automating ineffective business processes, and
          overconstrain the developers’ design options. The analyst must drill

          the customer has presented.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Distrust between the business and the
          development team</strong></span> As you have seen throughout this book,
          effective requirements engineering demands close collaboration among
          various stakeholders, particularly customer communities (the
          business side for IT projects) and developers. If these parties do
          not feel that their counterparts are working in good faith toward a
          mutually beneficial outcome, conflicts can arise and requirements
          elicitation can be threatened.</p></div><div class="book" title="Requirements analysis"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3447">Requirements analysis</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">It isn’t prudent to just record whatever the customer tells
          you and dive into development. Requirements analysis poses its own
          threat areas, as described below.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Requirements prioritization</strong></span>
          Ensure that every functional requirement, feature, or user
          requirement is prioritized and allocated to a specific system
          release or iteration. Evaluate the priority of new requirements
          against the backlog of work remaining to be done, so that you can
          make appropriate trade-off decisions and iteration plans.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Technically difficult
          features</strong></span> Evaluate the feasibility of each requirement to
          identify those that might take longer than anticipated to implement.
          Use status tracking to watch for requirements that are falling
          behind their implementation schedule. Take corrective action as
          early as possible. Prototype the novel or risky requirements to
          select effective approaches.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Unfamiliar technologies, methods,
          languages, tools, or hardware</strong></span> Don’t underestimate the
          learning curve of getting up to speed with new techniques that are
          needed to satisfy certain requirements. Identify those high-risk
          requirements early on, and work with the development team to allow
          sufficient time for false starts, learning, and
          experimentation.</p></div><div class="book" title="Requirements specification"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3448">Requirements specification</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1746" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-3449" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2043" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2044" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2173" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2510" class="calibre"></a>Requirements are all about communication.

          they are actually understood.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Requirements understanding</strong></span>
          Different interpretations of the requirements by developers and
          customers lead to expectation gaps, in which the delivered product
          fails to satisfy customer needs. Peer review of requirements by
          developers, testers, and customers can mitigate this risk. Trained
          and experienced business analysts will acquire the right information
          and write high-quality specifications. Creating models and
          prototypes that represent the requirements from multiple
          perspectives can reveal fuzzy, ambiguous requirements.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Time pressure to proceed despite open
          issues</strong></span> It is a good idea to mark areas of the
          requirements that need further work with TBD (to be determined) or
          as issues, but it’s risky to proceed with construction if these
          haven’t been resolved. Record who is responsible for closing each
          open issue and the target date for resolution.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Ambiguous terminology</strong></span>
          Create a glossary to define business and technical terms that might
          be interpreted differently by different readers. Requirements
          reviews can help participants reach a common understanding of terms
          and concepts.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Design included in
          requirements</strong></span> Design elements that are included in the
          requirements place constraints on the options available to
          developers. Unnecessary constraints inhibit the creation of optimal
          designs. Review the requirements to make sure they emphasize what
          needs to be done to solve the business problem, rather than
          dictating the solution.</p></div><div class="book" title="Requirements validation"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3450">Requirements validation</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Even if you’ve done a good job on requirements elicitation,
          it’s important to confirm the quality and validity of the solution
          that the requirements specify. Validation offers the following
          pitfalls.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Unvalidated requirements</strong></span>
          The prospect of reviewing a lengthy requirements specification is
          daunting, as is the idea of writing tests very early in the
          development process. However, if you confirm the correctness and
          quality of each set of requirements before their implementation, you
          can avoid considerable expensive rework later. Include time and
          resources for these quality activities in the project plan. Gain
          commitment from your customer representatives to participate in
          requirements reviews. Perform incremental, informal reviews to find
          problems as early and cheaply as possible.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Inspection proficiency</strong></span> If
          inspection participants do not know how to inspect requirements
          effectively, they might miss serious defects. Train all team members
          who will participate in inspections of requirements documents.
          Invite an experienced inspector from your organization or an outside
          consultant to observe your early inspections to coach the
          participants.</p></div><div class="book" title="Requirements management"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title5" id="calibre_link-3451">Requirements management</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="calibre_link-1972" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2038" class="calibre"></a><a id="calibre_link-2042" class="calibre"></a>Much of the requirements-related risk on a software
          project comes from how changes are handled. Those and other
          requirements management risks are mentioned below.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Changing requirements</strong></span> You
          can control rampant scope creep by using documented business
          requirements and scope definitions as the benchmark for approving
          changes. A collaborative elicitation process with extensive user
          involvement can cut requirements creep nearly in half (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-522">[ref131]</a>). Detecting requirements errors early reduces
          the number of modifications requested later on. Design the system
          for easy modifiability, particularly when you are following an
          iterative life cycle.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Requirements change process</strong></span>
          Risks related to how requirements changes are handled include not
          having a defined change process, using ineffective change
          mechanisms, failing to incorporate valuable changes efficiently, and
          incorporating changes that bypass the process. A requirements change
          process that includes impact analysis, a change control board, and a
          tool to support the process is an important starting point. Clear
          communication of changes to the affected stakeholders is
          essential.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Unimplemented requirements</strong></span>
          Requirements tracing helps you avoid overlooking any requirements
          during design, construction, or testing.</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre"><strong class="calibre12">Expanding project scope</strong></span> If
          requirements are poorly defined initially, further clarification can
          expand the scope of the project. Vaguely specified areas of the
          product will consume more effort than anticipated. The project
          resources that were allocated according to the initial incomplete
          requirements might be insufficient to implement the full scope of
          user needs. To mitigate this risk, plan on a phased or incremental
          delivery life cycle. Implement the top priority functionality in the
          early releases, and elaborate the system’s capabilities in later
          iterations.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Risk management is your friend"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3452">Risk management is your friend</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">A project manager can use risk management to raise the awareness
        of conditions that could cause the project to suffer. Consider the
        manager of a new project who’s concerned about getting appropriate
        users involved in requirements elicitation. The astute manager will
        realize that this condition poses a risk and will document it in the
        risk list, estimating the probability and impact based on previous
        experience. If time passes and users still are not involved, the risk
        exposure for this item will increase, perhaps to the point where it
        compromises the project’s success. I’ve been able to convince managers
        to postpone a project that could not engage sufficient user
        representatives by arguing that we shouldn’t waste the company’s money
        on a doomed project.</p><p class="calibre3">Periodic risk tracking keeps the project manager apprised of the
        threat from identified risks. Escalate risks that aren’t adequately
        controlled to senior managers, who can either initiate corrective
        actions or make a conscious business decision to proceed despite the
        risks. Risk management helps you keep your eyes open and make informed

    learn about new techniques, develop improved processes, pilot and adjust
    them, and roll them out to the rest of the organization. And it can be
    difficult to convince the various stakeholders that change is needed.
    However, if you don’t change the way your teams work, there’s no reason to
    believe that the next project will go any better than the last one.</p><p class="calibre3">Success in software process improvement depends on:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Focusing on a few clear pain points at a time.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Setting clear goals and defining action plans for your

    calibrate your team’s current requirements engineering practices and to
    identify areas to reinforce. You can download a copy of this assessment
    and a spreadsheet to help you analyze the responses from the companion
    content website for this book. More comprehensive assessments are
    available if you want to get a more precise understanding of what aspects
    of your current practices and documents would benefit most from
    improvement. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-525">[ref216]</a> offers a thorough project
    assessment that can be adapted to evaluate your organization’s
    requirements practices and deliverables.</p><p class="calibre3">To complete the quick assessment in this appendix, select the
    response for each question that most closely describes the way your team
    currently deals with that requirements issue. If you want to quantify the
    self-assessment, give yourself 0 points for each (a) response, 1 point for
    each (b), 3 points for each (c), and 5 points for each (d) response
    [except for question 16, where both (c) and (d) are worth 5 points]. The
    maximum possible score is 100 points. Generally speaking, the higher the
    score, the more mature&mdash;and likely more effective&mdash;your requirements
    practices are. Each question refers you to the chapter or chapters that
    address the topic of the question.</p><p class="calibre3">Instead of just trying to achieve a high score, use this
    self-assessment to spot opportunities to apply new practices that might
    benefit your organization. Some questions might not pertain to the kind of
    software your organization develops. Also, situations are different; not
    every project needs the most rigorous approaches. Recognize, though, that
    informal approaches to requirements increase the likelihood that your team
    will end up doing excessive rework. Most organizations will benefit from
    following the practices represented by the “c” and “d” responses.</p><p class="calibre3">The people you select to complete the assessment could influence the
    results. Watch out for respondents who, rather than describing what’s
    really going on in the organization, might bias their responses based on
    politics, on what they wish was being done, or on what they think the
    “correct” answers should be. Asking multiple people to complete the
    self-assessment independently will help remove some of that bias and
    provide a more realistic representation of your current practices than
    asking just one person. Multiple responders might also reveal different
    understandings of how certain practices are being performed at present.
    You can use the spreadsheet tool provided on the companion content website
    to accumulate multiple sets of responses and view the distribution.</p><div class="book"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1"><p class="calibre3">How are the project’s business requirements defined,

    stakeholders, you can successfully implement improved requirements
    development and management practices in your organization. You should
    select practices that will solve or prevent specific requirements-related
    problems that your projects experience. After you’ve identified the most
    pressing issues you’re going to address, it’s important to determine the
    root causes that contribute to each observed problem. Effective solutions
    confront root causes, not just superficially observed symptoms.</p><p class="calibre3">This appendix lists many symptoms of requirements-related problems
    that you might encounter. The symptoms are accompanied by related possible
    root causes and suggestions for dealing with each problem. Of course,
    these aren’t the only possible problems, so extend this table with your
    own experiences as you encounter&mdash;and handle&mdash;symptoms that aren’t listed
    here. Sometimes observed symptoms are themselves root causes of other
    problems. For instance, the process symptom “People performing the BA role
    don’t know how to do it well” is a root cause of numerous elicitation
    symptoms you might observe. These things chain together; not all of the
    possible links are shown here.</p><p class="calibre3">Unfortunately, there’s no guarantee that a proposed solution will
    cure your specific symptom, especially if the underlying problems are
    political or cultural in nature or if the root causes lie outside the
    development team’s sphere of control. As we’ve cautioned before, none of
    these solutions will work if you’re dealing with unreasonable
    people.</p><div class="book" title="Common signs of requirements problems"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3457">Common signs of requirements problems</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Problems are conditions that lead to a negative impact on your

      difficult to implement those actions, and possible ways to get around
      those obstacles. Common barriers to implementing changes in requirements

    to be complete. Instead, they are meant to illustrate how the various
    types of requirements information relate to each other and how you might
    write the contents of each document section. The information in these
    examples could be organized and grouped in many other reasonable ways,
    including combining it into a single document on a small project or
    storing it in a requirements management tool. Clarity, completeness, and
    usability of the requirements information are the essential objectives.
    The examples conform to the templates described in previous chapters.
    Because this is a small project, some template sections have been
    combined. Every project should consider how to adapt the organization’s
    standard templates to best suit the size and nature of the project.</p><div class="book" title="Vision and Scope Document"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_link-3471">Vision and Scope Document</h2></div></div></div><div class="book" title="1.

          spend an average of 65 minutes per day going to the cafeteria to
          select, purchase, and eat lunch. About 20 minutes of this time is
          spent walking to and from the cafeteria, selecting their meals, and
          paying by cash or credit card. When employees go out for lunch, they
          spend an average of 90 minutes off-site. Some employees phone the
          cafeteria in advance to order a meal to be ready for them to pick
          up. Employees don’t always get the selections they want because the
          cafeteria runs out of certain items. The cafeteria wastes a
          significant quantity of food that is not purchased and must be
          thrown away. These same issues apply to breakfast and supper,
          although far fewer employees use the cafeteria for those meals than
          for lunch.</p></div><div class="book" title="1.2 Business Opportunity"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-3474">1.2 Business Opportunity</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">Many employees have requested a system that would permit a
          cafeteria user to order meals (defined as a set of one or more food
          items selected from the cafeteria menu) online, to be picked up at
          the cafeteria or delivered to a company location at a specified time
          and date. Such a system would save employees time, and it would
          increase their chance of getting the items they prefer. Knowing what
          food items customers want in advance would reduce waste in the
          cafeteria and would improve the efficiency of cafeteria staff. The
          future ability for employees to order meals for delivery from local
          restaurants would make a wide range of choices available to
          employees and provide the possibility of cost savings through volume
          discount agreements with the restaurants.</p></div><div class="book" title="1.3 Business Objectives"><div class="titlepage1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title6" id="calibre_link-3475">1.3 Business Objectives</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">BO-1: Reduce the cost of cafeteria food wastage by 40% within

          ordering processes, employees who use the Cafeteria Ordering System

For example, there                 is a diamond labeled placing between the rectangles labeled                 patron and meal order. The lines between objects have either a                 one or an m on them, to indicate a one-to-one, one-to-many, or                 many-to-many relationship between the rectangles." class="calibre17" /></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;D-3.&nbsp;Partial data model for release 1.0 of the Cafeteria
